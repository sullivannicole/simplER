We have over two dozen different properties and unit configurations to accommodate just about any size group for Airbnb travelers!  (Look them all up in one place clicking on our picture to access our profile, then see ""View All Listings"" on the left side).   All of our spaces are private individual units.  Everything from one room studios to single family homes to an apartment building where we could host 50 people at once!  (We own the whole place!  Well, along with the bank!)  

We very much enjoy helping others make the most of their visits to Minneapolis, St. Paul and the Lake Minnetonka area of our beautiful state, Minnesota.  

When we travel, we like warm places when Minnesota is cold... Cali, Hawaii, Florida.  But family ties take us to places like North Dakota and Ohio, too.  

We like contrasts, Jenna loves food that wakes up your taste buds and Scott thinks cream of mushroom soup is a little spicy!  

We especially enjoy the cultural scene in the Twin Cities area.  More people per capita attend plays here than Manhattan!  Modern dance is another one of our favorite ""evenings out"", and the music scene here is always lively --  from folk to rock and everything in between (one of us has an interesting point of view, having been a deejay at the club where Prince filmed Purple Rain).    

People sometimes ask how we ended up doing this... it boils down to a very aggressive real estate agent!  :-)  Plus, we are both down-sized refugees from Corporate America.  We like having our guests as bosses, instead of (some of) the guys and gals in the corner office that we worked for!  

If you want to learn more about the area to make the most of your trip, we are happy to help.  But we will never be intrusive.   We try to greet in person, but can't always manage it with too many people arriving at the same time, or an emergency at one of the spaces.  

However, we are always available by email and phone and emergency phone.  We ask people to think of us as the front desk of the hotel.

If there is anything (we want to emphasize it) please get ahold of us if there is a challenge!  There is nothing worse to us than hearing of a problem in a review, when we never heard it from the guest while they were here!  Don't be shy!  

Thanks for reading.
