0,The Shawshank Redemption,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3870888/,"i watch this movie for minimum 5-6 times first to last. so every time i enjoyed as i watching it first time. its a piece of art. and we now know how to entertain with no action or fighting scenes. its a pure drama that anyone can enjoy with family in silence. so i rate this movie 10 out of 10 because of amazing screen play, acting, casting, background scoring editing etc. this is my first movie review so pardon me if i did any mistake.",N/A
1,The Dark Knight,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1917099/,"Dark, yes, complex, ambitious. Christopher Nolan and his co-writer Jonathan Nolan deserve a standing ovation. I don't usually go for loud movies filled with mindless gore and violence. ""The Dark Knight"" is certainly loud and violent but it's not mindless. It has depth and soul. Even the Joker, in an extraordinary creation by Heath Ledger, is deeply human. The natural petulance of Christian Bale makes his ego and alter ego the most fascinating and complex of all film superheroes. Part of the genius of this movie is that Batman himself, in screen time, is not really the lead. My attention was captivated by Heath Ledger and he determines and inspires the breathtaking atmosphere that envelopes Gotham as well as us. The aplomb of Christopher Nolan as a director is mind blowing and his secret, I believe, is his obvious respect for his audience. What he's done is to elevate a popular genre into Shakesperean proportions. Bravo!",The Dark Knight
2,The Dark Knight,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5478826/,"Confidently directed, dark, brooding, and packed with impressive action sequences and a complex story, The Dark Knight includes a career-defining turn from Heath Ledger as well as other Oscar worthy performances, TDK remains not only the best Batman movie, but comic book movie ever created.",The Dark Knight
3,The Godfather: Part II,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0135607/,"Coppola's masterpiece is rivaled only by ""The Godfather, Part II"" in which the 1940s setting of the first movie is extended backwards and forwards to reveal the corrupting effect of power...The film, breathtaking in its scope and tragic grandeur, shows two parallel stories extending two different time periods: the early career of young Vito Corleone seen first around the turn of the 20th century in Sicily, and then in 1917, building his criminal underworld in the Italian ghettos of New York City, post World War I, plus that of his son, Michael (Al Pacino) desperately trying to keep his family together...Al Pacino's performance is quiet and solemn... He is cold and ruthless, with a whole contrast from the idealistic innocent war hero we initially met at the beginning of the first film... Here he's a calculating and frightening force, seeking to expand casinos into Pre-Revolutionary Cuba and consolidating an empire surrounded by perfidy and treason, maintaining total confidence in his ability to control the situation whether testifying before enraging Senators or trying to outface his worst enemies...The film's haunting final shot of a lonely, isolated paranoid Michael in his empty compound, is an unforgettable movie scene, a tragic portrait of a lonely and fully damned person, emotionally empty and finished, far from a waspish wife, more distant from a faithful lawyer...De Niro's rise, from an orphan child by a family feud back in Italy to a hood in New York and his position as a respected Don, provides a welcome break from Pacino's relentless attitude... Since the people he kills seem to deserve it, Vito comes off better than Michael does, and it was wise of Coppola to shuffle the two stories together despite lengthy flashbacks and the disturbance of continuity...The entire cast contributes greatly to the success of the film: Lee Strasberg, a fascinating mixture of lust and ruthlessness; G. D. Spradlin, absolutely right as the sinister and corrupt Nevada Senator; Michael V. Gazzo, unforgettable as the troubled gray-haired informer; Gastone Moschin, excellent as the blackmailer in white suit; John Cazale, marvelously timid as the vague, confused, and hesitant Fredo; Diane Keaton, clearly irrational as the long-suffering wife Kay; Talia Shire, too extravagant as the lousy mother; Troy Donahue too ambitious as the fortune-hunting suitor; and Robert Duvall excels as the confidant, and retainer to the all-powerful Corleone family...Coppola's motion picture is not just a mere supply with new characters and events from the original, it's a far more complex and intimate movie than its predecessor... It is not really a sequel... It's just more... It cleverly shifts in time between two distinct narratives with extreme realistic violence and criminal mentality of gangsters...","The Godfather, Part II"
4,12 Angry Men,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0059999/,"An excellent courtroom drama with a unique twist. Instead of following the trial itself, the viewer has a unique chance to observe the events behind the closed doors of a jury room. The film begins with the end of the trial. The jurors retire to deliberate the case. A preliminary vote is taken and the result is 11:1 in favour of the guilty verdict. Eleven jurors have raised their hands to convict a young man of killing his father. Only Juror #8 has doubts. At first even he does not truly believe the young man to be innocent but notes (rightfully) that the case for the defence might have been presented in a more convincing manner and that the boy might be given the benefit of a doubt. Since the boy is to be executed if found guilty his life is now in the hands of the jury and juror #8 reasons that the least they could do is talk about the case a bit. As time goes on some of the jurors change their minds and find that there is perhaps enough reasonable doubt not to convict the young man after all. But not everyone is easy to convince.Although the plot of the film is excellent and it is fascinating to see what little things can influence which way a verdict goes, where this film really succeeds is in presenting the characters of the 12 jurors. The character of each of the jurors emerges through a wonderful mix of perfect casting, excellent dialogue and near-flawless acting.Juror #1 - a simple man who clearly does not understand the full complexity of the task that lies before him but is trying to do everything not to let anyone else find this out. He appears at ease only once during the film - when he talks about football. He has the misfortune to be selected foreman of the jury - a task he clearly does not relish.Juror #2 - a small, quite man, clearly unaccustomed to giving his own opinion much less to expecting his views to be of any importance. Apparently he finds solace in his job - he is an accountant.Juror #3 - probably the most complex personality in the film. Starts off like a pleasant self-made successful businessman, he analyses the case impartially, explains his arguments well and is reasonably self assured. As time goes on he becomes more and more passionate and seems to be somehow personally involved with the case.  He also starts to show some signs of slight mental instability. Wonderfully played by Lee J. Cobb - this is the character you remember after the film is over.Juror #4 - self assured, slightly arrogant stockbroker. Obviously considers himself more intelligent than anyone else in the room, he approaches the case with cool heartless logic but (as one of the jurors says - ""this is not an exact science"") he does not take into account the feelings, the passions, the characters of the people involved in the case. He is conspicuous by the fact that he is the only juror that does not take his jacket off (it is a very hot day).Juror #5 - here is a man under great emotional stress. He comes from the same social background as the accused boy - with who he almost unwillingly seems to identify with. Paradoxically this appears one of the main reasons for him voting guilty - he does not want compassion to influence him - so ironically it does.Juror #6 - a simple man, quite readily admitting that everyone in the room is better qualified than he is to make decisions and offer explanations. But he really wants to see justice done and it worries him that he might make a mistake.Juror #7 - the only one that really has no opinion on this case. Literally throughout the film his thoughts are never on the case - he talks of baseball, of the heat, of fixing the fan but the only reason he has for voting this way or that is to speed things up a bit so he might be out of the jury room as soon as possible. Not an evil man he just has no sense of morality whatsoever - he can tell right from wrong but does not seem to think it's worth the bother.Juror #8- a caring man, has put more thought into the case than any of the other jurors. He tries to do his best even in the face of seemingly impossible odds.Juror #9 - a wise old man with his great life experience has quite a unique way of looking at the case.Juror #10 - the most horrifying character in the film. Votes guilty and does not even try to hide the fact that he does so only because of the boy's social background. The tragedy comes from the fact that his own social position is only a cut above the boy's - which makes him all the more eager to accentuate the difference.Juror #11 - an immigrant watchmaker, careful methodical man, well mannered and soft spoken. respects the right of people to have different opinion to his - and is willing to look at both sides of the problem. Loses his temper only once - horrified by the complete indifference of juror #7.Juror #12 - a young business type - perhaps he has his own opinions - but is careful to hide them. What he has learnt out of life seems to be that intelligence is equal with agreeing with what the majority of people think.The film succeeds in doing something very rare today - developing an intelligent plot while also developing 12 believable, memorable and distinct characters.",12 Angry Men
5,The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3379367/,"I've just re-watched The Lord of the Rings trilogy for the 1000th time tonight... nearly 15 years since the Fellowship of the Rings was released... I still haven't seen a movie that's better, nor close, to any of these three films. The casting is perfection as well as the incredible acting by everyone in the movie. I can still watch these movies back to back and not get bored. They are a light to this world and wouldn't be the same without them.I miss the good old LOTR's days. The best movies ever created.

6,Schindler's List,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0328355/,"This Movie was sensational. It was a piece of art along with being informational. It told people about the holocaust, and it also told people about the human spirit. It shows how people can just triumph over anything with just some help from one person The things that Spielberg did with the movie was incredible too. The black and white was genius, and how he had the little girl in red and the fire was phenuminal. I have never seen anything like it, Schindler's List is beyond all words.",Schindler's List
7,Inception,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2290791/,"Is it just me, or was this unintelligible? Not just 'hacking' into someone's dreams but manipulating their thoughts inside Dreamworld. And then, to add to the confusion, we had dreams within dreams within dreams! If the complex plot had an internal logic which appeared not to defeat Leonardo DiCaprio - it certainly defeated me. There is considerable homage to the MATRIX films, with aerial fights and frozen motion sequences: kid's stuff, but what do kids make of the anarchic storyline? If you die in someone else's dream, you can either wake up alive or go to a place called Limbo (not the same as the one Dante envisaged) which looked like the flooded New York of The Day After Tomorrow a few decades on. The plus side of Limbo for Leo was that it reunited him with his dead wife (Marion Cotillard), but was this his limbo or hers? Best not to ask.If MEMENTO, with time running backwards, was Christopher Nolan's ""set text"" for Filmgoing GCSE, I guess INCEPTION represents A-Level movie comprehension.And I seem to have failed.",Inception
8,Fight Club,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5262199/,"Fight Club is one of those movies that hits the spot without missing an inch of it. The nameless narrator (Edward Norton) is an insomniac office worker who lives a materialistic life. From the very beginning the movie comments on the capitalist nature of society by portraiting how consumerism moves the world, but is unable to give relief in the end. Flipping through catalogues of new furnite for his apartment were the narrator's only personality trait. To fight against his insomnia he starts attending to support groups. By lying to people, pretending he has conditions he does not have, the narrator finds relief - the emotional acceptance he finds in the support groups is enough to allow him to sleep at night. The emotional complexity of the character is nothing unrealistic. David Fincher makes a subtle, yet clear, comment on the nature of materialist societies where no one really listens to each other nor care about each other. The system doesn't care about anyone, the distance between people - especially enhanced by how they function in the capitalist world - is a major plot point. However, when the narrator is finds someone who's a faker just like him he loses his emotional escape - "" Her lie reflected my lie. Suddenly, I felt nothing. I couldn't cry, so once again I couldn't sleep"".Shortly after Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt) is introduced into the story, the main character loses everything he valued. Deprived of his possessions he seeks solace in the company of a man who is the polar opposite of what he is. If the narrator is a worker who's way too worried about his condo and his job, Tyler is a freewheeling soapmaker who couldn't care less about all those things. The contrast between them is clear; Tyler refuses any consumerist logic from the narrator whilst making he see how futile is the lifestyle he was leading - ""Right. We are consumers. We're the by-products of a lifestyle obsession."" The characters here portraid are so different because one of them is free, while the other is not. Tyler, in a nihilistic way, helps the narrator realize that his existence is meaningless enough - something that is clearly displayed in the capitalist world - that all they can do is giving up everything. The self-destruction promoted by the Fight Club is ironically what allows the narrator - as well as many other frustrated men - to find solace in their mundane life. Little by little the narrator is stripping himself off his previous beliefs about job, about behavior and the value of things. It's interesting to note that the narrator doesn't quit his job immediately, picturing how hard it is actually to cut ties with the system - he eventually does though.Many subtopics are discussed through the movie. We see the narrator and Tyler, now living together, talking about many things. They talk about how both had an absent father, how both lacked a sense of direction in life at some point and were told to follow the common sense - ""He says, 'get a job'. So, I'm 25, I call again and say, 'now what?' He says, 'I dunno. Get married"". The nature of the system we live in tells us what to do since the moment we're born, while both of them agree on that, they also agree that this is all a great waste of time. It's important to notice though that both them had no significant connections with other people, especially with women as Tyler comments - ""We're a generation of men raised by women. I'm wondering if another woman is really the answer we need"".As the club grows the movie delves even deeper in those reflections about what really matters in life - ""Advertising has us chasing cars and clothes, working jobs we hate so we can buy s**t we don't need"". Tyler becomes the source of inspiration for everyone who attends to the fight club; everyone is much more like the narrator, but they're striving to be more like him. At some point, Tyler decides that the club is meant to be something bigger - what he would call Project Mayhem. While the original Fight Club was something kept like a secret idealized to give some sort of freedom, through self-destruction, to its members, Project Mayhem is about declaring a fight against the system. The frustrated collective consciousness was the straw that broke the camel's back - ""We've all been raised on television to believe that one day we'd all be millionaires, and movie gods, and rock stars. But we won't. And we're slowly learning that fact. And we're very, very pi**ed off"". However, the narrator starts to slowly go against what Tyler was meaning to do - kinda of recalling a bit of his past self and a sort of respect for the authority of society - and when this happen it's the moment the movie reaches its climax.The genius of the movie is displayed when we discover that Tyler Durden and the narrator are the same person, they have always been the same person. Due to his declining mental health and his rather meaningless life, he created an alter-ego - someone capable of manifesting everything he wasn't as a system abiding person. The contrast created by Tyler's different personalities is amazing to watch as the truth unfolds; and the ambivalence created when we discover the truth about Tyler Durden is even more marvelous. This movie portraits very well how a person can reach the extremes of their mind in a system that overlooks the relevance of your very existence - when you become just a number, just a braindead member of society, having your hopes and wishes constantly ignored. In the end Tyler recovers his sanity only to see that his actions can't be reverted - so he only stands by and watches. The final scene is beautiful; what could be bettar than watching the system crumbling before your eyes while ""Where is my Mind"" plays? This movie is a masterpiece and it is so entrancing because of how real it is - in the end the movie shows many things we know and think but tend to keep hidden. It is provocative, funny and thrilling and most importantly: It is so damn real. The plot aged perfectly and I don't think it is going to get old so soon - this movie is a must watch.",Fight Club
9,The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0460052/,"Simply incredible. Never before have I seen a 3 hour movie that didn't seem like 3 hours. I read the Lord of the Rings very recently and I was surprised at how similar Peter Jackson's vision was to my own.Now about the omissions and alterations. I'm not a crazed fanatic who gets worked up over every little detail. I didn't mind Arwen's inflation and I'm actually glad Tom Bombadil was scrubbed (I felt Tom Bombadil was an unnecessary addition to the book). Despite these minor changes, the screenplay stays extremely close to the book and flows very very well (and the prologue was a nice touch).The acting was flawless. As I've read many many times in other reviews, McKellen doesn't play Gandalf, he IS Gandalf. Wood, Mortensen, Holm, Astin, everyone was fantastic. My hat's off to Sean Bean who delivers an excellent performance as Boromir, a character who's intentions are good but wrestles with the corrupting power of the Ring. Bean portrays it VERY well. Oh, and Andy Serkis does a PERFECT Gollum voice. It's EXACTLY as I imagined it myself.The special effects were incredible, the cave troll, the balrog, Gollum, and Sauron's Eye all looked amazing.

11,Forrest Gump,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3472550/,"I remember John Byner, the stand-up comic and impressionist of the 1970s talking about guys crying at movies, how it's not an acceptable behavior. He advised the men in his audience to drop their keys, do something that gets them to lean forward, wipe their faces, and get things under control.I dropped my keys watching Forrest Gump. Lieutenant Dan comes over the hill at Forrest and Jenny's wedding, new legs, fiancé at his side, clean-cut and happy.Forrest states the obvious, ""Lieutenant Dan, you gawt le-eggs!""And the water-works just started to flow.I sit up straight and clear my throat. Got 'em (the keys, that is). My wife leans over and gives me a kiss. She says, ""That's why I love you.""Other than a few historical fussinesses and plot slickeries, none of which are worth mentioning, this is as close to a perfect, emotionally-satisfying entertainment as I have ever seen. I love this movie. I never tire of the simple story of the guy with the lowest IQ in the room being the smartest guy in the room. It's filled with a patriotic decency you can only find in The Wizard of Oz and To Kill a Mockingbird.When Dorothy is aching for home and the Wizard can't deliver, I drop my keys. When Scout points to the man behind Jem's bedroom door and says, ""Hey, Boo,"" the fob goes flying.The next time I get out my copy to show to my 11th Grade US History kids, I'll start fingering my key chain. I can't help it.",Forrest Gump
12,Forrest Gump,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1088679/,When I first saw this movie I didn't appreciate it like I do now. I think it may have been because I was so young when I first saw it. Just recently I saw the movie again. What an amazing story and moving meaning. That movie teaches you so much about life and the meaning of it. That life isn't as bad as most people make it seem. That an innocent man can impact so many lives with his innocence. The meaning of the movie to me is that everyone needs to have a better outlook on life. That we need to appreciate more of the little things and not let the big things hold us back. That truly although life may throw us trials and tribulations like a box of chocolates but that we have to just bite into it and get through it even if we don't like it. That we all need to hold true to our values and not sink into a place that feels like there's no hope... I just love this movie. And anyone who hasn't seen it or who thinks that don't like it I seriously suggest seeing it or seeing it again. It truly is amazing...,N/A
13,"The Good, the Bad and the Ugly",https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0092647/,"Ok- first, as mentioned in another review, the geographic/historical errors in this film are GLARING. You've got men carrying revolvers that look like old style cap-and-ball pistols, but they're loading them with metallic cartridges- historically about five years early. Eastwood carries a rifle that hasn't been invented yet, Tuco assembles a ""superpistol"" out of a Colt, a Remington, and a Smith and Wesson- impossible. And there was nothing of merit taking place between the North and South during the Civil War in the Southwest. Now, that aside, I must say that this is the Greatest western ever. I first saw this film when I was about ten. I'd never sat through an entire Western befor, even though my Dad watched them constantly. Since then, I've been through film school, watched hundreds of Westerns, learned to appreciate them- but NOTHING matches up to this. The Searchers, Stagecoach, Gunfight at the O.K. Corral, The Gunfighter, High Noon, Shane- all great films, but saddled with the standard American Western morality- the good guy never takes liberties with the eastern schoolmarm, the bad guy wears a black hat, etc. Coming from Italy, TG,TB &TU isn't bound by these conventions. Blondie's the ""good guy""- but he's also a bounty hunter. He makes a living in a highly immoral way, but is obviously the ""good""- not because we're told, but from small acts- giving the dying soldier a cigar, making sure the Captain knows to hold on till he hears the bridge blow, the genuine regret he feel for having to let Shorty die. And while Angel Eyes may be the Bad, we at least know he has prinicpals- when he's hired for a job, he always sees the job through. And Tuco may be more immoral than the other two, but he's so savvy and his role so humorous that one can't bring oneself to look upon him disfavorably. In other words, historical inaccuracies aside, TG, TB, & TU maybe one of the most accurate portrayals of the West ever put on film- there are no clear-cut lines of conduct, no black and white, or even grey, but just a swirled palette of various facets of the human condition.","The Good, the Bad and the Ugly"
14,The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1306916/,"The Fellowship of the Ring was a monumentally entertaining film, the Return of the King was an amazing wrap-up to the epic of our times, but the most dramatic moment for me came at the end of the Two Towers. After 3 hours of sweeping vistas, excellent Shakespearean acting, and otherworldly sights and sounds, we are treated to a scene that still sends chills down my back and rouses me like nothing since the final scene in Rocky. A lone rider (we all know who), set against the top of a hill, massing legions of horsemen behind him. He appears just as the heroes are losing all hope. Once he begins his descent down the hill with his army behind him, the camera begins a slow pan over the top and down with them, showing the size and scale of their forces. The evil army below looks up with surprise, a bright light fills the screen, the camera focuses on the lead rider (again, we all know who) who lets out a wrenching battle cry, the music swells to unbelievable heights, and I am swept away like I've never been before.This is cinema at its very best.",The Two Towers
15,The Matrix,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0509368/,"Who is to say what is real or not? We are defined by our view of reality, no matter how twisted or demented it is in comparison to 'normal' people. *evil eye* Yes, I see you all, looking in the mirror, trying to decipher whether or not your view is the reality we all share.The Matrix not only supplies the world with a whole new level of special effects mixed with style and substance, it also brings a whole new meaning to the word 'paranoria'. This is one of those great epics that becomes a milestone in our present day world, a mark for which just about everybody can appreciate. Not since the original Starwars trilogy has a science fiction film reached across almost the entire population and gripped it with awesome special effects, great sound, and a overall feel of ground breaking movie making magic. It also serves up a good dose of paranoid delusions we all need in our lives every now and then.With that, I leave you with the fact that I've seen more different types of people liking this one film than most other films to date. Move over George Lucas, you may have just met your match... :)",The Matrix

Every frame, every voice-over, every song - it all comes together at the exact right moment to create the perfect film experience. This film makes you really understand and feel what makes the American mafia so compelling; in the eyes of a kid, who was unfortunate enough to grow up in a tough neighborhood, those gangsters are rock stars. Live fast, die young - but when you die, it ain't gonna be of a glamorous suicide or drug overdose - the ending will be brutal, ugly and sad. And it may very well be one of your best friends that will blow your brains out.I'll never get tired of watching Goodfellas; the entertainment value of this film is just amazing. It doesn't happen very often that every person involved in the process of making a film is at the peak of his/her game. And rarely do art and entertainment come together the way they did here.

At first, I was a little detached, not liking the songs too much, and thinking I would probably just skip through to end in a minute. I couldn't stop watching and it really sucked me in. I have to say, I'm not sure I would have enjoyed it at all, live in the theater. I benefited greatly from the captions and the ability to put it on pause to consult Wikipedia from time to time. The lyrics were so clever and really told the story. I ended up very moved and almost cheering at the end. Of course, now that I am familiar with the story, I would love to see it live and would enjoy it immensely. But I would strongly recommend this for a first time viewing. I will definitely re-watch.

18,Parasite,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5446179/,"""It's so metaphorical"" is what Kevin says when they show him Da-Song's paint, he makes a statement without knowing absolutely nothing about what he is talking about, most critics of this movie say exactly that ""It's so metaphorical"" obviously Most know what you are talking about, when writing something about a movie I have to be 100% sure that I have understood.""It's so metaphorical"" This comment on this movie is quite fair and precise; Parasite is built on the basis of visual symbolism that for some it will be an easy task to find them and for others a little more difficult because it also does not put this type of visual metaphors in the foreground, sometimes leaves it to the public's interpretation and in others simply play with the camera and film techniques to tell us the story, a clear example is the first time Kevin visits the Park house, the house is shown in a low-angle shot from the ground showing the superiority of the house and the environment over the character, the rain scene in the middle of the movie is simply wonderful: the family plummets to its miserable reality and the camera descends in a peculiar way, as there are many examples throughout the film; the fight over the cell phone in the Park house looks like an animal fight, the shots in the Kim's house are closed and in the immense Park house they are open and wide, a lot of voyeuristic Hitchcokian shots and provocateurs of vertigo, the symbolic use of the stairs throughout the film, something quite coherent since the film speaks especially about the socioeconomic classes and the social and race stairs, are some simply steps over others. Who are the real Parasites? the Kims or the Parks? the film plays with this question and leaves the answer to the interpretation, the Kim who represent the great majority of the poor class in Korea and in the world act as parasites that will gradually owe the class that is above them, taking advantage of the comforts that it offers them without any difficulty, living under the ground and in precarious conditions, but on the other hand the Park are practically useless beings, there is nothing they can do: their children are educated by others, their clothes are ironed and washed by others and their food is made by others.Kim's family at least shows that Kevin is good at Languages, even better than many college students, his sister has great skills that lead her to create the perfect plan, even she manages to do what no sophisticated teacher did; control and support Da-Song, but due to their poverty their hopes that they can take advantage of this kind of talent are minimal. The final shot of the movie plays with us and gives the perfect blow to culminate this story: Kevin writes a letter to his dad that he probably won't be able to read, while he has a dream, after the dream the shot is the same that of the beginning, he It shows the exterior of the house from the basement this time without sun, showing that he it is where it began and that now its life is dark and empty of hopes.",Parasite
19,Parasite,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5195256/,"It's not really a review but my attempt to explain how I interpreted the movie to those who complain that the film is overrated, especially if the reason is that they didn't like the second half of it.It's much easier to understand the message of a movie when the 'good guys' win or the 'bad guys' get punished in the end. I'm not saying that all Hollywood films are so naive in their portrayal of moral values. But still, I believe that Parasite is much more subtle than most other movies that people are accustomed to watching in which there's a character with a clearer 'moral center' whom audiences can easily relate to. So, I think it's no surprise if the message of this film had failed to register for some of the audiences.Some complained that they don't understand Ki-Taek's motive for killing Mr. Park. But to fully appreciate this, you need to understand the meaning of a recurring expression in the dialogue which is, ""crossing the line"".It's a deliberately ambiguous phrase that can either read as one should respect other people's privacy or as one should mind one's own (social) position instead of meddling with the affairs of those in a different position. If interpreted as the latter meaning, it can serve as another image that emphasizes the subject matter of the narrative, along with more easy to notice the metaphor of the two families' respective dwellings.It would probably have satisfied such audiences who expected more lighthearted drama if the movie focused on an underprivileged, but more likable family exploiting a cold hearted snobbish family in a comical manner. But the movie would have lost all its genuine charms if Bong Joon-Ho chose such a path, and he is too good a director not to see such a danger.Instead, he chose to make Mr. Park a reasonable enough character, despite his occasional hints that reveal his true nature. He seems to treat Ki-Taek fairly enough at first, but he also warns the latter not to 'cross the line' if Ki-Taek attempts to pry into his private life.At first, it seems that it's quite easy for Ki-Taek and other members of his family to sneak into Mr. Park's house in various roles and mingle with them. Ki-Taek even compliments how nice Mr. Park's family is, but his premature admiration soon gets challenged when he overheard, when he was hiding under the table, what Mr. Park really thinks of him - almost a different species of the human being who doesn't even smell like him.Ki-Taek's final disillusionment came when Mr. Park cringes from the smell of the dead basement dweller and shows much more concern for his son's shock while virtually ignoring Ki-Taek's daughter's status who's dying on the ground, spurting blood from the stab wound.That moment, Ki-Taek realizes how Mr. Park sees him and his whole family as not an equal human being, but something much more insignificant.And he also realizes the 'line' that separates the two families is not just that of courtesy or proper social behaviour. Instead, it is a line that can even determine the life of those 'lesser' human beings to be less important than the passing unpleasant feelings or mental shock of those 'proper' human beings.However easy it was for Ki-Taek's family to sneak into Mr. Park's house, or however they try to socialize and mingle with Mr. Park's family, their existence is no better than that of a 'parasite', which is also visualized so effectively by the presence of the hidden basement room inside the house.With such disillusionment and anger, Ki-Taek chose to kill Mr. Park, as a parasite could to its host, and like a parasite, he keeps hiding deep inside the dead host's body until he could claim the whole of the carcass and use it as nourishment for his offsprings.The tragedy was not something caused by any exceptional defect or vice of either Mr. Park's or Ki-Taek's personalities. Instead, it's a 'line' drawn by an invisible hand, separating those classes according to their respective social conditions, which can be so brutal as to be able to deprive the two families of their humanity in contrasting manners. And that is what I believe to be the message this film is trying to convey.Of course, not every movie must make a commentary on society rather than providing a care-free pastime that everyone can understand.But without if the movie didn't change its gear in the second half to shed light on a serious inherent problem of our society, it would be just another heist gone wrong type comedy, instead of a deserving candidate to be called the best film of the year.",Parasite

23,City of God,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0871189/,"The story begins in the present days, in a barbecue party in the slum of 'Cidade de Deus', with some bandits chasing a chicken. Then, a teenager called Buscapé (Alexandre Rodrigues) tells the story of the Cidade de Deus and the main characters of the movie (Zé Pequeno, Bené, Cenoura etc.), since they were kids. This movie takes place in Cidade de Deus, a set of buildings originally built in the 60's for poor persons originated from a big flooding in Rio and from some slums. In the 60's, this area was isolated, without any infrastructure. Nowadays, with the construction boom, it is located close to Barra da Tijuca and Jacarepaguá, very valuables zones. Rio de Janeiro City is surrounded by slums, where the situation presented in the film is the reality of thousands and thousands of honest poor persons. This movie is remarkable: the screenplay, the direction, the performance of the cast, everything works perfectly. The frantic camera looks like a documentary. Today the DVD was released in Brazil, I bought it and I have just watched it with my family. I really can imagine the reaction of foreigners watching this sad side of Rio de Janeiro. It is strange, because a person who does not live in Rio probably may think that this movie exaggerates in some aspects. However, this is our reality. Lost bullets, robberies, violence is part of our day-by-day life. By the other hand, the same person may think that life in Rio 'stinks', and again it is not true. My city, like a golden coin, has two sides: heads and tails. If you can afford, you have wonderful places to live. But unfortunately, a great part of the population lives in slums, like the ones showed in this movie. The lack of perspective in life of the children, unemployment, ridiculous salaries, lack of education, lack of the faith, all of these factors contributes for the formation of the next generation of drug dealers and bandits. The traffic offers positions to the kids, like showed in this movie. And in the end, even when the 'grown-ups' are arrested or murdered, there is a bunch of children to occupy the spot. A sad social problem, but true. My vote is ten.Title (Brazil): ""Cidade de Deus"" (""City of God"")","""Cidade de Deus"" (""City of God"")"
24,Spirited Away,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0727579/,"Mystical. Enchanting. A key to another world. There are so many ways to describe this movie. The movie focuses on a young girl who is trapped in a sort of ""spirit world"". When her mother and father are turned into pigs, young Chihiro has to save her parents before they're cooked and eaten. It may sound silly, but this tale has more to it than farm animals. When Chihiro is frightened, she runs off. When a boy finds her, he tells her that she must get a job at ""The Bath House"". A sort of retreat for spirits. But to do this, she must speak with Yubaba. The witch who rules The Bathhouse. After Yubaba agrees to give Chihiro some work. She takes her name away from her. And she is then called ""Sen"". While shes at the bath house, she is put under very hard work. I could say more, but that would be foolish of me. This is a great movie that I think people of all ages should see for themselves. Its an enchanting and heartwarming story that I've watched over and over again and have never gotten sick of it.

25,Spirited Away,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2928533/,"Personally, I've never seen anything as original in an animated film as in this deeply mythical fairytale. What a surreal idea for a movie! It's hard to find an adequate description (because I also don't want to spoil this in the slightest way) but this film has a sense of ""otherness"" to it - for lack of a better word - like none I've ever seen. And the strange, mythical nature of this film - apart from the amazing artwork - is probably one of the main reasons for its appeal to me. Maybe the themes of the story don't feel quite as strange to an eastern audience because they fit to a certain degree with some eastern/Asian mythologies - to me, this beautiful piece of wonder was something new. And a profoundly moving experience. Outstanding animation; funny, weird, scary and touching at the same time, this unique work of art is one I can't recommend enough. 10 out of 10.Favorite films: http://www.IMDb.com/list/mkjOKvqlSBs/Lesser-known Masterpieces: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls070242495/Favorite TV-Shows reviewed: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls075552387/Favorite Low-Budget and B-Movies: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls054808375/",N/A
26,Saving Private Ryan,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0470869/,"During the Normandy landings during WW2 two brothers are killed.  In another part of the world another of the Ryan brothers is killed in action, leaving their mother with one remaining son and three telegrams due to be delivered. A group of men, led by Captain Miller set out to reach Private Ryan and not only break him the news but to safely return him for return to the US.What can I say  it is an excellent film despite some minor flaws.  The plot is based on a real life situation during WW2 and allows for us to follow a group of men as they take part in the horrors (and humanity) of war.  This is the film's strength and it is never stronger than in the first 25 minutes and, to a lesser extent, the final 20 minutes.  The opening of the Normandy landing is simply pure emotional power and is really well done  it is so powerful that the actual plot itself is a bit of a letdown.  I love Band of Brothers because the focus was on the war and what it was like to be involved rather than a sort of soap opera story.  Here the plot is still very good but can't really follow that opening.It also sinks into sentiment a tad too often.  For example Ryan's mother lives in this sort of Norman Rockwell painting that is Spielberg's vision of middle America.  Also there is a little too much use of gawkish dialogue as well  although it's hard to criticise the death scenes for being emotional, because they should be.A minor flaw that is easy to get over is the lack of Brits.  Like Band of Brothers (which had a few cockney accents) this is an AMERICAN film  so of course they will focus on the American experience.  However it would have been nice to have some British (or any other) voices or faces among the Allies.  I can understand why the film opens and closes with the stars and stripes and why the film focuses on the yanks but a little bit of perspective would be useful.  There's nothing wrong with focus  but when it totally excludes huge bits of information then it's a problem.  It always makes me think of the way that Michael Caine took his children back to the UK when they were taught in an US school that WW2 started in the 1940's (ie  when America joined).However this is a minor flaw as, in fairness, it's an American film  why be surprised when it's focus is Americans!  Of the cast Hanks is good  he is much more subtle than his Oscar roles where he played to the crowd.  He benefits from having a great support cast of good actors, current actors, old faces, up and comers etc.  Sizemore, Burns and Farina are the good current actors.  Damon, Ribsi, Diesel, Martini etc are all very good on the way up  although Damon has one of the simplest characters.  They may all be slight stereotypes of Americans but it's not a major flaw  just a screen writer wanting to cover all bases I think, although it does grate that they cover all these backgrounds but can't squeeze any other Allies in to the edges.Overall it is excellent despite some stereotyping, US flag waving and the usual Spielberg love of sentimentality.  Even if the actual plot is flimsy Spielberg expertly puts us as close to experiencing the horrors and the humanity within war as I hope we'll ever be.",Saving Private Ryan
27,Saving Private Ryan,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4391013/,"My grandfather fought in WW2 somehow surviving D-Day. He was apart of Operation Neptune and stormed the beaches of Normandy. He told us a lot of war stories but rarely ever spoke about that day. Before he passed away he did an interview with a local newspaper and detailed what he saw despite it being very difficult for him to speak about. He loved watching war movies... not sure exactly why. Some about that soldier life never really leaves them I guess. He absolutely hated Pearl Harbor cause of the horrible way they portray the military to be a bunch of toothbrush wielding babies who don't know what to do in the event of being attacked. He had a friend stationed there who lost his life and thinks that movie is a disgusting display of ignorance. Soldiers don't take girlfriends on private plane rides. And they most definitely know how to swim. Maybe I'll give that movie a good ripping one day.But Saving Private Ryan was a respectable ""I can't watch this"" reaction. He said no movie has come that close to capturing what that day was like. He said it was too realistic. Whether or not the story is based on real or fiction, that intro was 100% realistic. I'm not sure if he ever did finish watching it but he appreciated it for capturing that chaos like no other movie has before. I watched the movie a dozen times now and keep it in my collection as a reminder of my grandfather. A scene he was technically in. Which makes me appreciate how strong of a person he really is.War is hell and this movie not only shows that while being an entertaining experience but also captured what soldiers are left behind with. My grandfather was not afraid of anything. I've seen this man walk into a cellar full of black widows to get firewood and not even shake them off. The only time he ever experienced fear was when he went to bed. His nightmares of his time during the war would haunt him in his sleep. This movie helped me understand why.",Saving Private Ryan

And once again, it comes from watching a Frank Darabont movie. I couldn't possibly explain the overload of emotions I experienced in the 3 hours it lasts. I have laughed. I have felt the emotions of every character. And most of all, I have cried. Very few movies have touched me like this one. Is there something to say about the acting that hasn't been said before? No, it isn't. You may have heard it is flawless, incredible, whatever. You did hear right, it absolutely is. I can't think of anyone in the whole movie that wasn't convincing in the least. The script has its funny moments, but it's incredibly deep, poignant and heartfelt. The characters are so ""human"" and unpretentious you can't help but adore them. But, well, there will be some you'd like to strangle. There has to be a villain everywhere, right? The Green Mile is a movie I will hardly forget.

30,Life Is Beautiful,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1078552/,"There are a small handful of reviewers who are lambasting this film , crying phrases like ""unrealistic and contrived"" , ""emotionally manipulative"" and most risibly ""an insult to the memory of the victims of the holocaust"".Id like to address such interpretations.In the latter day audiences search for films bereft of cliché, derivativeness and lack of independence there seems to be a counterintuitive rationale that if a film cannot be explicated and stand up to analysis from every myriad aspect of possible critique, then it lacks worth or merit , taken as a piece of work in its own right.It should be suggested that the intent of the film is so clear,the aims of the film so evidently manifest, that to brand the film unrealistic and then carp on with minor details regarding obvious inconsistencies, is to not be able to see the film for what it very plainly proclaims itself to be.This film NEVER tries to be realistic in the modern sense of film critique, this film freely admits to being contrived, this film unashamedly focuses on the characters at the expense of portraying an historically accurate reality.For the whining reviewers to not see this, is either an example of disingenuous folly or plain hard-heartedness.The film is driven by ideals, of romance and of selflessness.This film clearly asks the watcher to suspend belief, to enter into its fantasy, to embrace the human emotion as elucidated through the characters.Not only is this film NOT an insult to anybody who has ever been persecuted (Jew,Chilean,African,Russian,Japanese,Chinese,Cambodian - the list of persecution goes on), rather it heightens empathy for such people in this plight ,through the use of poignancy.Its intent is NEVER to trivialise such.Yes the uniforms aren't dirty enough , yes Guido takes ridiculous risks,yes the likelihood that the German guards knew some Italian are apparent but the question is - given the context of the presentation - do those niggling details matter ? Surely the film is engaging the viewer on an emotive level,evoking empathy for the individual case,for the desperation that sees a father moved to unthinkable extremes in an attempt to prolong the life of his son.Thus - surely , Guido's actions should not and never were intended to be 'realistic' but rather he is - to our despairing eyes ,simply pathetic ie he is evoking pity.How any discerning fair minded person could honestly and objectively brand this film as disrespectful and hateful because of comedic elements, is missing the point by oceans.This film is about the individual circumstance and thus the slapstick and ingenious way we are drawn into knowing the characters and the way we are immersed in the burgeoning love story of the small boys' parents, necessitates the audience to empathise,to engage,to feel.The by-play between father and son is to look at innocence personified,the bitter sweet forgoing of self in a seemingly doomed essay at escaping the impending inevitable spiral into oblivion.I think Life is Beautiful is an important work that might demand a rethinking of priorities by hard hearted critiques , who may have to shed that veneer of bloody-minded nitpicking and, to wit, see the forest for the trees.Of course the film is flawed,what film attempting such a tight balancing act between comedy and poignancy isn't? But there is a certain state of mind and spirit that needs to be adopted to be receptive to its message and i fear perhaps that such vulnerability and innocence required seems too hard and bitter a pill for some.If only they dare taste - its sweetness and candour resonate persuasively,indelibly.",Life is Beautiful

If I had to sum it up in one word, superlative would be my answer. I saw the film for the first time three months ago and loved it, and since then I have watched all the Star Wars movies. I was disappointed with the prequels (Attack of the Clones was my least favourite), but this, Return of the Jedi and Empire Strikes Back were perfection.I have to say that the film looks absolutely amazing even after thirty plus years, with highly imaginative sets and dazzling special effects. And the action sequences were superbly choreographed and brisk, the Death Star climax was a knockout. The music by John Williams is absolutely outstanding, by far one of his more exciting and rousing scores. The story is fast-paced, intelligent and has an essence of sophistication, and the screenplay is sharp and decisive.And the performances were flawless. In the prequels I had problems relating to some of the performers, namely Hayden Christensen as Anakin. Here, all the actors played their parts with superlative skill. Alec Guiness, one fine actor and will be sorely missed was a standout, likewise with Peter Cushing and Harrison Ford(hilarious here). Carrie Fisher was a fine Princess Leia, spunky, beautiful and sexy, and Mark Hamill was a completely likable Luke. And the villain Darth Vader, without doubt one of the best and in-depth villains in cinematic history, and James Earl Jones's deep booming voice was perfect for the character.All in all, a definite sci-fi classic, that blew me away. 10/10 Bethany Cox",Star Wars: A New Hope
36,Hara-Kiri,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1175679/,"I saw Harakiri (Seppuku) in a new 35 mm print at NYC's Film Forum. This is a brilliant use of a narrow period genre to explosively indict politics and culture. Writers Shinobu Hashimoto and Yasuhiko Takiguchi surely must have been as inspired by ""The Count of Monte Cristo,"" Ambrose Bierce and Howard Hawks' Westerns as much as by samurai literature and movies.The film begins deceptively as a story within a story, seemingly providing a traditional example of upholding samurai honor, such as in the conventional, oft-retold tale of ""The 47 Ronin."" The context is set at a time when the central government, the shogunate, is supplanting local clans and arbitrarily unemploying thousands of people, notably their samurai, forcing them into the mercenary mode of ronin at best and begging for food at worse. But the parallels to the 20th century are made repeatedly explicit as the samurai who comes to this clan seeking help is from Hiroshima.Very gradually we get further insight on the tale within a tale, as we see more flashbacks within flashbacks into what each character has been doing before these confrontations and we get uneasy inklings that the moral of the story may not be what it appears at first and the stakes get higher and higher with almost unbearable tension.It is almost halfway through the film until we see a female and we suddenly see an alternative model of masculinity, where a priority is put on family, support, education and creative productivity. In comparison to the macho opening relationships, with their emphasis on formal militaristic loyalty to a hierarchy, a loving husband and father is practically a metrosexual. Seeing the same stalwart samurai making casual goo goo sounds to his grandbaby puts the earlier, ritualized scenes in sharp relief, particularly the recurring image of the clan's armor which seems less and less imposing and is finally destroyed as an empty symbol.The psychological tension in the confrontations in the last third of the film is more excruciating than the actual violence. Even when we thought we already knew the outcome from the flashbacks, the layers of perception of relationships and personalities are agonizingly peeled away with each thrust of a sword to reveal the depths of the horrifying hypocrisy of the political and social structure. And those are just the overwhelming cultural resonances that a 21st century American can glean. Like ""Downfall (Der Untergang),"" it reveals the inhumane mentality that led to World War II.The repeating motif of long walks then confrontations down empty corridors emphasizes the stultifying bureaucratic maze that entraps the characters. The revenge motifs are accented by startlingly beautiful cinematography that recalls traditional Japanese art, including drops of blood like first snow flakes then a waterfall.The over all effect of this masterpiece is emotionally draining.",Harakiri (Seppuku)

38,Joker,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5408799/,"The recurring themes of so many of the 10 star reviews here should tell you a lot about this movie and its audience. If you can't get through a movie review without tossing in one or more claims that ""THIS movie is so much better and smarter than YOUR superhero movie"" (or even basing your entire review around this premise), then I hate to break it to you, but kid, you're nowhere near as intelligent and grown up as you think you are. This ""my comic publisher is better than yours"" BS should have been left behind on your grade school playground, it has absolutely no relevance to the quality of this movie, and your opinion of this movie should be considered highly suspect if you're in this group.I gotta say, if this movie was also your idea of the most perfect film ever made, you really need to get out more. Look, I get it. If you live in a safe little box where all you watch are superhero movies and mainstream blockbusters then I understand how exposure to themes like this for the first time would seem new and exciting to you, and I think we can all agree that this is probably the best DC Comics related movie in the last decade or so (though that's not a high bar to meet) and of course Joaquin Phoenix is a very talented actor, but stop and take a step back and look at this thing.Joker does indeed present a theme that is of importance to our society, that of the neglect and demonizing of the mentally ill to a degree that sometimes creates monsters which everyone around them should have seen coming a mile away if they hadn't been too busy looking away to avoid feeling uncomfortable. Unfortunately, reminding us all of the fact that this situation still exists is all this movie really has to say. It dances around important subjects like ""HEY KIDS, CLASS INEQUALITY!"", but then never offers any actual insight into them, usually because it's too busy making forced Batman references or dropping cringey little edgy moments like the ""Don't smile"" sign scene which seem to have been designed solely to have something for Hot Topic to print a new t-shirt of. Between that and every single plot twist being telegraphed so very far in advance because a lot of us have seen all these exact same twists so very many times before, I just wasn't impressed.Perhaps if this had been an actual stand-alone movie of its own instead of being shackled by its completely unnecessary ties to the Batman universe it could have done something more interesting with its themes. Don't get me wrong, I don't have any problem with superhero movies, but it just feels so gratuitous here, as if someone came up with this idea, pitched it to an executive, and was told ""sounds great, but can you make it a Batman movie somehow?"", and I'm sorry, but I'm just not into a movie trying to tell me a half-hearted, yet dead-serious speech about mental illness in modern society while simultaneously constantly reminding me that it's technically a superhero movie because $$$",Joker

I've been a jazz musician for over 30 years and have taught in a jazz university for over 20. So they figured I would relate. Sorry, this is total crap and it makes me sad to think that the average guy out there thinks Kenny G is cool and this film is a hard-edged depiction of the high-pressure jazz school scene. First of all, no prof would be there a day after any of the rehearsals Terence ran, he'd be dismissed immediately (not hard to do, apparently this school didn't have tenure). And next, jazz is communication, conversation, thoughtfulness, and a big dollop of joyful soul. Any drummer with the competitive mean-spirited attitude shown by any of these students would find themselves in extremely lonely company, nobody appreciates that. This is the 21st Century equivalent of Mickey Rooney and Judy Garland saying, ""I know, let's build a show to save the town!"" as a representation of Show Biz. it's Hollywood hokum, folks, and I resented its basic assumptions. Where is the Soul? That said, J.K. Simmons is great, working with what he's got. And the cinematography and editing are well done (what IS all that water on the cymbals we see so often? Sweat? If Elvin Jones had gained two hundred pounds he wouldn't have sweated like that! Oh well.) which is why I grudgingly added two stars to this. It's been a while since I so disliked a film.

A great musician? Our protagonist has a dream of being a great drummer, a drummer that will be remembered forever. Maybe you are still fighting for your dream. Maybe you have given up on greatness. Greatness doesn't come easily, you need to practice at it. Andrew practices until his hands bleed.Andrew (Miles Teller) is 19-year old student at a music conservatory in Manhattan. Terrence Fletcher (J.K. Simmons) is a teacher at the conservatory with a ruthlessly brutal teaching style. After picking Andrew to play in the school band, he pushes Andrew to his limits in order to realize his full potential, at the risk of his humanity.I had a billiards teacher at one point in my life, who was close to becoming a pro in his craft but a grease fire accident changed all that. His perspective changed, to paraphrase, he realized he was becoming an asshole. He became a teacher of pool instead of becoming a pro player. Through him, I can understand what Terrence Fletcher was trying to instill into Andrew. My teacher would push me a little bit. When he gave me opportunities to show him up, ""run the table now,"" he would tell me, I failed. It's embarrassing when that happens but it's also a learning tool because more work needs to be done. You can't get by on talent alone but it certainly helps. On the other side of it, I saw a little bit of my teacher in Andrew. Losing who you are to perfect something you love. Good thing my teacher realized before it was too late.I lost myself in the story. It had something to say about not settling and asking more of yourself. Two fantastic performances from Miles Teller and J.K. Simmons. Perhaps it will push you to maybe pick up that guitar again, put on your ballet shoes, or hit the gym to bulk up. Whiplash is an incredibly powerful film. And after the final shot cuts to black, the film will stick with you for days.My expectations: Medium. I did not expect the film to be so powerful for me. Expectations exceeded.Recommendation: Cinema lovers and casual movie goers, I believe will enjoy this film.Re-watch value: I can watch this film again and I actually can't wait until it hits distribution.Memorable: I am still thinking about this film.",Whiplash
42,The Intouchables,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2530723/,"It's not because I'm French that I appreciated this movie which I've seen twice. Too give the really infamous appreciation of the reader from Toronto to the French public, qualifying us of a segregationist country is difficult to gulp especially coming from north America which has not a very glorious past on the matter even in recent years. Perhaps the commentator should see the movie ""The help"" to refresh his memory... But what I'd like to say here apart of praising the fabulous interpretation of both leading actors is to remind that this is a true story, it did not come out from the directors and scriptwriter heads.Philippe Pozzo Di Borgo born in 51, got a dramatic para-glider accident in the French Alps in 1993 being totally deprived of movements from the base of his neck to the tip of his feet. 3 Years later his wife died and he was helped out of his depression by Abdel Sellou his life-aid assistant. He published his terrible story in 2001 under the title ""the second breath"" (in French ""Le second soufflé""). The directors have had the compliments of Di Borgo for the way they adapted his story. If in any way this was biased he would never had accepted the film to be left in that state. The Di Borgo family is a very old and wealthy family whose origins goes far back in the history of France, and their residence in Paris is considered to be one the jewels of the capital at the same level as The Hotel de Sully in Paris. What is shown in the film is exactly what happens everywhere in the world as far as handicapped are concerned: tendency to overwhelm them with pity which is more diminishing them as if their fate is not enough for them to swallow every minute or second each day. The way the racial problem is viewed is properly demonstrated. The police behaves in different ways depending of the color of your skin or your country's origin and sorry to say North America is a very good example of this so perhaps is not a proper judge on this matter.The authors had the courage to state this straightforwardly. The film shows on the contrary how a man with a very limited education at the beginning, a former convict, is capable progressively to change his views, and find in himself at the same time the good Samaritan aspects and help with humor and punch, his handicapped boss to find a new belief in his shattered life at 42! At the same time the boss demonstrates an open-mindedness which was not obvious to get not only because of his handicap but because of his origins and his wealth at first. Let's not illusion ourselves on the matter, everywhere in the world few wealthy people would accept to have as an aid an ex convict whichever color his skin should be! It's a fantastic lesson of tolerance, and friendship. For just those reason this movie would deserve an Oscar or Golden Globe awards.09/07/2013 : I've just seen that under ""Crazy credits"" is mentioned that 5% of the revenues of the film will go to an institutions caring for disabled persons.

43,The Intouchables,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2524388/,"Do not look at this through the prism of ""Foreign Films"". You'd be wasting your time and miss something far too important.Hollywood does scale like nobody else, leaving the competition gasping in its wake. France does intimacy, and brutality. Nothing is sacred. And rather than try to revive the New Wave or emulate Hollywood like most widely seen French films of late, ""Intouchables"" harnesses its core strengths - ease with intimacy, willingness to ridicule anything and brutal honesty - and delivers one of the funniest, most honest and touching films I have ever seen.Sy is a failed robber, going through the motions and playing the stereotypical jobless émigré. Cluzet is a romantic and melancholy mind trapped in a useless body. The circumstances that bring them together are too funny to spoil here, but meet they do, and an awkward relationship quickly blossoms as they bring out the best in each other.The film's simplicity is delightfully misleading: the script is a masterpiece of comedy writing, and however good the rest of the cast is, the central duo is magical. Sy's comic timing will have you in stitches, but it is his honesty and vulnerability that make you fall in love with the character. Cluzet isn't your typical sad-sack, instead, much of the finest pleasures in the film consist in watching him use his keen mind to mess with the world around him (a subplot about an abstract painting really takes the biscuit, you'll know it when you see it).This is one of the most unique, beautiful and honest friendships ever committed to film. It will make you laugh, it will make you cry... a delightful celebration of everything in life that makes it worthwhile.","The official title of the movie is ""Intouchables"""
44,The Prestige,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1493095/,"What ""The Prestige"" does very well is recreate a period of show business history near the turn of the century in which competition between magicians was serious and intense. The workings of the complicated illusions are gorgeously brought to life via smartly detailed apparatus that replicate the actual mechanics of Victorian legerdemain. Much of the film rings very true, such as the all-consuming obsessions of the lead characters to be the best and outdo all others. It's an easy step to accept that such unwavering determination spills over into deadly territory, as rival magicians suave Rupert Angier (a riveting performance by Hugh Jackman) and audacious Alfred Borden (Christian Bale effortlessly playing a brooding lower-class Brit) each seek to wreak continuing revenge upon the other.The story, though adapted from a novel, feels like a perfect fit for director Nolan's sensibilities, as the machinations of the two men become increasingly convoluted during a back-and-forth tug of wits that keeps you guessing in the style of Nolan's ""Memento."" As the game grows increasingly deadly, and threatens to consume all they love, the film becomes a fascinating study in single-mindedness.The work is epic in sweep, beautifully filmed, and strongly acted. The only odd note in casting is David Bowie as Nikola Tesla (he looks nothing like the actual Tesla, if you care about these sort of things, and his appearance calls attention to itself as superstar casting often does), but Mr. Bowie holds his own. Solid performances are all around, with Michael Caine adding dignity and depth as the old master, Scarlett Johanssen as the as the lovely stage assistant who becomes the third point in a twisted love triangle, and even Andy Serkis (Gollum!) in a memorable supporting role.The introduction of Tesla adds yet another twist, as the film shifts from real-but-possible stage illusion to steam-punkish sci-fi. This transition is a hard note to pull off, since the beginning of the film doesn't quite suggest such a direction, but if you're willing to let Nolan lead you on the journey into increasingly fantastic realms, the narrative rewards you with thought-provoking moral and dramatic exploration of the issues raised.A truly entertaining movie, and an original, unusual, dark ride -- well worth seeing in a theater for its grand scope and vision.",The Prestige

Leonardo DiCaprio gives what is quite possibly the best performance of his career. Even the people who hate him admit he did a good job. It's turned some haters into fans and my brother who despises him even says he was great. Matt Damon and Jack Nicholson give their best performances since The Talented Mr. Ripley and As Good As It Gets. Mark Wahlberg almost steals the show with the best lines. Ray Winstone, Alec Baldwin, and Martin Sheen are good, too.Definitely one of the best films of the 00's. And easily one of the best remakes of all time. It's intense, funny, exciting, suspenseful, superbly acted, violent, has great characters, and has one of the most shocking scenes I've ever seen. And there's not a boring moment in it's two and a half hour running time.

48,The Pianist,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1866580/,"Film makers have to step carefully when dealing with issues like the Nazi extermination program. There have been equally brutal programs of ethnic cleansing in places like Southeast Asia and Rwanda, in which hundreds of millions died, but nothing like this in Europe since the Middle Ages. The victims here were not only Jews but Gypsies, the mentally ill, homosexuals, socialists, communists, and political undesirables. The Nazis eliminated not six million but some uncountable number between 12 and 15 million. An event like that can't be treated lightly and milked for easy tears, or the event itself is cheapened.Fortunately, the films that have explored the subject have been uniformly well done, as Roman Polanski's ""The Pianist"" is well done. Polanski himself suffered in much the same way as the protagonist, Vlad Szpilman (Adrien Brody). Polanski has a habit of embellishing his tales but there's no question that in this instance he knows what he's talking about.Szpilman is a well-known young pianist on Warsaw radio but the German occupation puts the station out of business. He and his family are herded into the Warsaw ghetto where they are subject to constant abuse and occasional murder. Szpilman barely escapes being sent to Treblinka with the rest of his family. And for the last half of the film, with the help of some friends who endanger themselves by lending him aid, he scuttles rat-like from one hiding place to another, each more dismal and perilous than the last. He suffers jaundice, his hair and beard grow long, his clothes turn to tatters, his food disappears, he's half frozen, and he seems to shrink.He's reduced to living in the attic of a nearly demolished apartment building and is ecstatic to discover a gallon can of pickles overlooked on the top shelf of a kitchen cabinet. The can falls out of his hands while he tries to open it and rolls across the floor to come to rest at the boots of a German officer, Captain Hosenfeld (Thomas Kretschmann). The only Germans we've seen so far have been brutes -- ridiculing the insane, executing Jews who ask simple questions, or simply shooting people chosen at random.We expect nothing from Hosenfeld except a quick shooting. But Hosenfeld is a human being and, having discovered that Szpilman ""is"" -- or rather ""was"" -- a pianist, he asks him to play a piano left in one of the flats. Szpliman has been unable to play for years and when he seats himself we worry that he might not bring it off and, indeed, his first chords are tentative, uncertain. Then his playing becomes automated, the old habits return, and he dashes off a dramatic and exquisitely executed piece of Chopin. Hosenfeld has been leaning back, enjoying the music, then leaves Szpilman quietly to his attic. He returns a few times later, before the Germans withdraw before the Russians, and unceremoniously hands him a few packages of food and, finally, his overcoat. The matter-of-fact compassion shown by Hosenfeld, and Szpilman's desperate need for contact with another human, are very moving.When the Russian troops finally arrive, Szpilman stumbles out of his hovel to greet them, but seeing his overcoat the Russians open fire on him. Szpilman finally convinces them that he is a Pole, not a German, and one of the befuddled soldiers asks, ""Then why the ****ing coat?"" Szpilman is trembling with fear but manages to gulp, ""I was cold."" An epilogue tells us that Szpilman went on with his career and Hosenfeld wound up in a Soviet prison camp where he died in 1952, despite Szpilman's attempt to find him. Under the end credits, a smiling Szpilman plays a lively, sparkling composition by Chopin.It's a remarkable film. Polanski is no longer the Wunderkind but a mature film maker. Nothing is excessive. We need only as much as we need to know to understand Szpilman's travails -- one tragedy following another. There are no sentimental speeches at the final parting of Szpilman and his family. Szpilman himself never breaks down. He simply does what needs to be done to survive. And Adrien Brody captures what Szpilman must have been like. (From some angles he resembles the young Arthur Rubenstein.) Kretschmann gets Hosenfeld down pat as well. In their scenes together we sense their respective positions -- one man with nothing left to lose, the other with nothing left to gain. The story, and the historical facts it's based on, raise many questions about human nature, of course. I'm not at all sure that if we could find the answers to those questions we would like what we found.One of the better films of the year.",The Pianist

The first time I watched it, I sat there as it ended, and I was just completely in a state of shock. This movie, more than any other movie I had seen on the subject of racism, really made me think twice about how I treated people of a different race. The way that Derek Vinyard's family was almost completely split apart and destroyed due to his racist beliefs should be a wake-up call to those people who have any racist beliefs whatsoever. I believe that this movie was a whole lot more than just a ground-breaking, controversial drama; it was a portrayal of exactly how much damage can be done to a family and a nation simply because of the hate for a person or people of a different color, for almost no reason at all. The Bible says that ""God created man in his own image."" It also says to, ""Love your neighbor as yourself,"" which, right there, implies that racism is not something people should even consider. I wouldn't recommend that anyone under the age of 16 see this movie due to its graphic content and language; however, I believe that everyone who is over the age of 16, should see this movie at least once.

52,Léon: The Professional,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0342948/,"Luc Besson's movie Léon (The Professional) gives us an intense story which is maximized in potential by the casting of the movie done by Todd Thaler.  Every aspect of the movie delivers to the audience and makes an impressive overall package.  Jean Reno plays a character named  Léon who has learned to repress his emotions in order to perform his job as a ""cleaner"", or hit-man.  His secluded world is shattered by the young girl named Mathilda who lives on the same floor as he does in an apartment building. When she turns to him for help, he learns about living a normal life, even if the circumstances which unite them are far from normal.The performance delivered by then twelve-year old Natalie Portman as Mathilda is nothing short of brilliant.  Her ability to relate to others with body movement and facial gestures is matched by few, she really brings raw emotion and believability to a difficult role.  Mathilda and Léon are unexpectedly thrown together, but learn to value life from their chance encounter, and how valuable a friendship can be.Jean Reno as Léon gives us a solemn and calculated character who sets all of his energy on his assignments until her is given something else to care about.  Mathilda gives him the daughter that he never had, while Léon serves as a father and friend to her.  Gary Oldman, as the corrupt DEA Agent Norman Stansfield, offers the viewers an amazingly wired and electrical performance which pushes the envelope.  He moves the story along by his actions.  Oldman offers us a memorable portrait of a sadistically obsessed man who stops short of nothing to get what he wants.The Professional is what movie-making is all about.  Without the overuse of special effects, a large shooting location, or a commercially star studded cast, we are given all that could possibly be asked for in a movie.  Portman, Oldman, and Reno, along with Danny Aiello as the hit-contractor Tony remind us that there is no substitute for great acting. There are elements of comedy, drama, and action, and great original music by Eric Serra adds to the energy the film already encapsulates.  The most impressive thing about the movie is its story which is basic but is maximized by all the other elements which go into the making of the movie. Simply put, an intense and impressive movie.",Léon (The Professional)
53,Terminator 2: Judgment Day,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1352753/,"15 years on and still Terminator 2 remains a turning point in cinematic history introducing the world to photo-realistic computer generated 3D rendering. To this day, this is still an astounding achievement, however (ironically) these are the things that re-watching the film now, you notice as not being to the standard we now expect films to be.As a result of this, you're then forced to look beyond the graphics in search of other quality. When I last watched it (about 3 weeks ago), something stood out to me that never did before because of no longer being mesmerised by the graphics.This was the interactions between characters who are gritting, no nonsense, hard edged people, but those who care deeply for one another. In particular, I'm referring to Sarah and John Connor, but also to the inhuman T-101 in all it's programming trying to humanise itself (at the demand if John).Though these might sound like day to day interactions (pardoning the whole terminator and robotic elements here), but to put them onto film and not have them feel forced or contrived is quite a feat, and all of these were achieved far above the expectation of one watching an ""action"" movie. You truly believe that John is devastated to have to lose T-101. You can tell he's fearful about Sarah going off to kill the man who would kill the world, unwittingly.I urge you all to sit down and watch this film again.

The dialogue runs the gamut from hilarious to heartbreaking, but always strikes exactly the right chord.The cinematography and effects are stunning, especially the scenes filmed during ""magic hour"", when the pale gold of sunset casts a meaningful and lovely effect on the scene. Being the first $100 million movie naturally the effects are remarkable for their time, but they hold up wonderfully against anything made today.It's the actors, however, who steal the show. Linda Hamilton can play insanity and despair like nobody's business, and she gave her all here. Robert Patrick was wonderful in the demanding role of the T-1000, creepy and threatening even during the funny finger-wagging moment. Arnold Schwarzenegger balances non-stop action with a machine's emerging humanity; frankly this movie cancels out every dumb action flick he ever made. New-comer Edward Furlong carried the film with seeming ease, giving an astonishing performance for his age and lack of experience; the ""We're not gonna make it, are we?"" scene is hauntingly perfect.James Cameron and his team have given us a classic that has something for everyone.

Cudos to the great Ennio Morricone & son Andrea. Many reviewers insist that the shorter, theatrical-release version is superior to the director's cut. The full-length version makes a central character morally ambiguous, in contrast to the uniformly benevolent father figure depicted in the shorter version. In the long version this character commits an act similar to but far crueler than the behavior of another character who is ridiculed early on. Most new viewers will watch the full-length film. The shorter version is more satisfying for those who secretly prefer fairy tales in which the good guys & bad guys are consistently good guys & bad guys.

56,Cinema Paradiso,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1024609/,"It is by now well known that there are two versions of this film that differ greatly, the original 3 hour Italian cut and the heavily re-edited 2 hour version which was the version that charmed the world in 1989. It remains a wonderful experience, but the director's cut is so much richer, deeper, satisfying,well,everything. This review is of the director's cut which may not be the greatest film in the world but is my favourite film of all time ever since I came out of the cinema in which I first saw it in back in 1994 crying my eyes out. Never has a film effected me as emotionally as this one. Cinema Paradiso is many things- a touching story of a friendship, a wonderful portrayal of a Sicilian village, a loving tribute to the cinema, amongst other things, but the longer cut is I believe the most moving and romantic love story ever. For my money, you can forget Casablanca,Dr Zhivago,Titanic,Romeo and Juliet,etc {great as some of them are}, this is the one that does it for me.Divided into three sections, it is the first section that was left almost intact in the short version. It is of course primarily concerned with the relationship between young Toto and the projectionist of his local cinema, Alfredo. It is full of delightful touches,such as Toto stealing a frame of film from behind Alfredo's back, or when Toto helps Alfredo during an exam so he can be allowed into the projection booth, or perhaps best and simplest of all of all Toto's spellbound face as he watches the footage that will be censored by the town priest. The cinema is portrayed as almost being the centre of life in the town Giancaldo in which the film is mostly set. The actual sequences set in the cinema are full of wonderful observation and even some belly laughs. There's the man who only goes to the cinema to sleep and is always awoken by kids, the couple who see each other for the first time because everyone else is cowering from Dr Jekyll And Mr Hyde, the old man who says ""no, this is IMPORTANT"" when everyone else ""booos"" the news-all human life is here, with more observations and insights than in any Mike Leigh film. This section climaxes in a scene which is simply magical, when Alfredo projects a film onto the wall of a house so everyone can see it.As the film moves forward several years to show Toto as a 16 year old, the wonderful cinema scenes are still present. Who can forget the cinema usher telling off a group of young boys for playing with themselves while watching Brigitte Bardot and then sheepishly giving his own manhood a little touch? Director Guiseppe Tornatore also subtly reminds us of changing times, such as when television is first shown in the cinema. However, it is mainly concerned with Toto's {now called Salvatore} courtship of the girl he is in love with, Elena. No one who has experienced the pangs of first love can fail to respond to such scenes as Salvatore ranting on to Elena on the phone how much he loves her and realising he's actually been talking to her mother, or the beautiful first kiss and embrace in the projection booth {of course}.It is in the final section, as Salvatore, now a great film director, returns to Giancaldo as a 50ish man to attend Alfredo's funeral,where the humour all but disappears {well, life gets more serious as one gets older, does it not?} and the pace does slow-be warned. It is possibly the most emotional hour of cinema ever, and was cut to about 15 mins in the short version. Salvatore's reunion with Elena, which also displays absolutely brilliant acting from Jacques Perrin and Brigitte Fossey, is so painful a sequence, as the two characters pour their hearts out to each other. As Ennio Morricone's love theme swells up {a truly heartbreaking piece of music},it ends up being one of the most beautiful love scenes ever filmed. Salvatore's reunion with his mother and his exploration of the cobwebbed, dilapidated, cinema are also extremely moving. As for the final scene, where Salvatore opens a certain gift Alfredo left him-well,there's been too many spoilers already in this review, but suffice to say it is matchless, simply matchless. It was moving in the short cut, but is three times more meaningful in the director's cut.Cinema Paradiso has been called sentimental, but in the director's cut it is a darker, deeper kind of sentimentality. Maybe it is still ""a love letter to the cinema"", but it is also shows that obsessive love of something such as films can also result in sadness and regret. Think of what happens to Alfredo in the film, and as for Salvatore, well, his curse is that he has two loves in his life but success in one of them comes at the expense of the other. The uncut Cinema Paradiso is more then anything else about life and the effect of the decisions we make. O, and the greatest, most heartbreaking love story ever {have I already said this!}",Cinema Paradiso

Never have I been so moved by a film in my whole life. I cried and cried and cried. Since then I can´t get this heartbreaking story out of my head.After the movie I went upstairs to the bedroom, where my 3-year-old daughter was sleeping. I woke her up and took her in my arms. In the way she talks and acts she is just like Setsuko, one of the main characters in the film. And I can´t help feeling like Seita, her brother - because my daughter and I are alone since my wife left us a few months ago.I found one of the most touching scenes was the one where the dying Setsuko starts sucking the buttons she collected, because she ran out of her special sweets. I will also never forget how her brother cremates her after having tried everything to save his little sister. The most depressing thing with this movie is: you feel so helpless. You think: Man, I wish I could have helped those kids.This movie has changed my whole attitude to life. All the problems you may have - they become so small. Watch it and you´ll be a different person.Michael Saunders",N/A
58,Back to the Future,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3686847/,"What can I say about this movie that was already said? It is my favorite time travel sci-fi, adventure epic comedy in the 80's and I love this movie to death! When I saw this movie I was thrown out by its theme. An excellent sci-fi, adventure epic, I LOVE the 80s. It's simple the greatest time travel movie ever happened in the history of world cinema. I love this movie to death, I love, LOVE, love it! I firstly saw this movie in the early 90's as a kid on VHS tape and I was blow away by the action and the score and the title back to the future. This movie is one of the best masterpiece time travel epic adventure film. Michael J. Fox and Christopher Lloyd are fantastic at acting. Music theme score by Alan Silvestri is excellent I could listen to it whole day.Back to the Future (1985) From the Academy Award ""- winning team of Steven Spielberg"" and Robert Zemeckis** comes the hilariously groundbreaking adventure that thrilled critics and audiences alike - and sparked one of the most successful movie trilogy ever! Directed by Robert Zemeckis the movie begins with Marty McFly (Michael J. Fox) a teenager who has a really messed up family. His ultimate goal was to become a rock star which was heartened by his girl friend Jennifer Parker (Claudia Wells). But things went wrong when scientist Dr. Emmett Brown/Doc (Christopher Lloyd) wanted Marty's assistance for his new invention.At that night Marty went to assist Doc's invention the Time traveling Car ""DeLorean"". Marty was told to record Doc's first time travel to the future. At that instant they were attacked by some Libyan terrorists who were cheated by Doc for Plutonium.After killing Doc they turn towards to Marty and without any intention Marty enters the Time Traveling car. But it was previously set by Doc and when activated Marty gets transfer to 1955 from 1985.What will he do next, will he can come back to the future, or will he stuck back in the past for his rest of the life. More than that will his time travel make serious effects on the future? Dealing with time travel and time paradox Steven Spielberg presents this amazing journey of Marty set up in the time of 80's and 50's. Scripted by Robert Zemeckis and Bob Gale for the story of Bob Gale himself, tells a science fiction adventure in a family oriented tone.They really work hard to sculpt that sci-fi thread into a thrilling, culture clashed family movie. A good story with a great script. Also the soul of the movie was given by the legend Alan Silvestri. His composition was all memorable especially in the chasing and emotional scenes. Over the top the theme music, it was the most dazzling and recognizable themes in the movie history.More than that the casting was simply brilliant, each and every actor is born to play their respected roles in this movie. Michael J. Fox was the only actor who can play the role of energetic Marty McFly, which was considered for numerous actors. Also Thomas F. Wilson was brilliant in his performance as the Bad boy Biff Tannen. Lea Thompson did a great work in portraying Lorraine Baines's two different life times, as a teenage girl and a matured mother. Well the extra talented Christopher Lloyd had almost ""chewed every scenes"" in the movie. Mr. Lloyd's versatile performance as the madman and genius scientist Dr. Emmett Brown is one of the great memorable roles in his carrier.Last but not the least, it was Crispin Glover who steal the show as the nerdy teenager/father as George McFly. It was an interesting portrayal as a boy who was transformed to a man. Crispin Glover lived in that part. I don't know whether the movie would be a masterpiece without his unique performance. Above all I want to remember this as a romantic movie and it couldn't be made without the songs ""The Power of Love,"" and ""Earth Angel"".The rating I am giving is 10/10 the original and the best one of all time. I love this film, it is my favorite time travel movie of all time and I love it to death! All in all it is the greatest sci-fi, romantic movie of all time. It is the part of the great Movie History, which consider itself as "" A Modern/Classic Masterpiece! """,Back to the Future
59,Once Upon a Time in the West,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0106407/,"Sergio goes Hollywood for this big-name, big-budget Spaghetti Western. Fonda, Bronson, Robards and Cardinale queue up and take Leone's choreographic direction in an epic tale of blood and revenge.Frank is a bad guy who has killed a lot of people.  He now works for a railroad entrepreneur whose ruthless sterile tracks are spreading ever westward.  The time has come for the real Americans to confront both the railroad and Frank.Leone sat down with film intellectuals Bernardo Bertolucci and Dario Argento and watched dozens of Hollywood westerns.  From this saturation-viewing emerged a 300-page treatment which was eventually distilled into the script, penned by Leone and Sergio Donati.  There are conscious echoes of ""Shane"" and ""High Noon"" in the meticulously-plotted screenplay.  Ennio Morricone apparently sat in on the planning stage and had composed the score in toto before shooting began, the reverese of the usual process of fitting music to existing footage.  The result is a tight matching of soundtrack and visuals.  Robards, Bronson and Cardinale each have musical 'signatures' which play whenever their characters are onscreen. Bronson's is an eerily-wailing harmonica, Robards has the plonking banjo and Cardinale the lush strings.  So intricately was everything structured that the themes were available to be played on set, so that the actors could co-ordinate every nuance of gesture to fit with the score.The film is a grandiose lament to the death of the Wild West.  Decay is everywhere to be seen.  Streets, bars, buildings and people all have a beat-up, grungy look.  When Cheyenne (Robards) pauses beside a rough-hewn wooden post, there is little difference in texture between his face and the post.  Morton the cripple is killing the romantic West of open spaces with his ""snail trail"" of railroad tracks, leaving the fine adventurous men (Cheyenne and Harmonica) nowhere to go.There can be few opening scenes with the visual and aural brilliance of this one.  Three bad guys stake out Flagstone's railroad depot in a High Noon pastiche.  Jack Elam (who was actually in ""High Noon"") leads the villains.  The only spoken words throughout this long (but totally gripping) scene are uttered by the old station clerk.  Haunting rhythms raise the tension to an unbearable pitch ... the squeaking windmill, the chattering tickertape, the creaking bench.  This wonderful crescendo climaxes with the appearance of Bronson, a sequence as stylised and choreographed as a Shinto ceremony, all the more effective for the absence of spontaneity.Equal to and counterbalancing this scene is the very next one, the introduction of Frank.  This time it is ""Shane"" that gets the treatment as the McBain boy spots five men in yellow duster topcoats.  A growing sense of unease on the McBain homestead is beautifully conveyed (was the stopping of a cicada chirp ever so effective?)  A cinematic multiple orgasm ensues, with the musical theme crashing in as the boy sees the devastation, and the camera swoops round to reveal the baddie to be none other than Henry Fonda as Morricone's trademark solitary tubular bell peals out.Cheyenne's entrance is also a piece of impressive cinema.  Inside Lionel Stander's strange labyrinthine tavern, quite unlike any saloon ever filmed before, the violence which hovers around Cheyenne like a dustcloud is heard but not seen, preparing us for his appearance in person.  The sliding of the lamp towards Bronson works brilliantly, the film's two good men sharing the light of humour, the symbolic forging of a meaningful friendship.By a slow accretion, the plot reveals itself.  The leviathan of the railroad must be stopped, and there must be a reckoning with Frank. Gradually the fates of the main characters converge, and swim into sharp focus for the shoot-out.It is not the story, excellent though that is, which lingers in the memory, but rather a hundred individual flashes of brilliance:  Claudia Cardinale (are those eyes for real?) filmed on the bed, viewed vertically downward, through a lace canopy: Cheyenne's surprise method of concealing himself on the train: Morton (""when you're not on that train, you're like a turtle out of its shell"") imprisoned by the armature that helps him walk: the 'heartbeat' of the train's engine during the cardgame: the tension of the ambush preparations against Frank: the eruption of guitar music as Bronson enters the frame: Bronson's stillness and self-possession, the emblem of his righteousness: Fonda's eyes flickering rapidly in his motionless head, denoting the waning of his self-confidence: the amazing super-close-ups of Bronson: and the weird brick arch, the only man-made intrusion into the entire terrain, and the focus of human depravity.",Once Upon a Time in the West
60,Once Upon a Time in the West,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4800696/,"In full silence, three mysterious men in long trench coats wait in a remote train station. Their faces have anticipation written all over them, even while the most interesting things they can find to do are toying with a fly, drinking water from a hat and cracking their fingers. A dog runs past. The windmill squeaks. The ticket vendor is locked away. The heath bounces off the wooden platform. The men sweat.
Are you bored yet? Then this movie is probably not for you.
But are you dying to know what the three men are waiting for? Does a light anxiety creep onto you whilst reading that description? Can't you wait for the tension to resolve? Then this movie is all you ever wanted.The almost lawless world where outlaws and bandits roam the country with ease that is the setting of the story, is shown by Tonino Delli Colli (director of photography) in all its splendorous grandeur and it's uncountable little details. The set pieces, the costumes and the real life locations in Arizona and Utah make everything believable. And together with the characters and figurants, everything creates a vibrant and utterly believable Western civilisation.Charles Bronson plays the man with the harmonica: a lone wolf looking for something that he chooses not to reveal to anyone until he gets it. A character with no name roaming the endless fields under the sun, announcing his presence at all times with the same melody he plays on his harmonica that echo's in an unsettling way. Bronson does this brilliantly, with a face that overflows with held back emotions and a determination that is downright scary.In a tavern the man meets Manuel 'Cheyenne' Gutiérrez (Jason Robards), a bandit that recently escaped being hung by the neck, re-joining his band of outlaws. With already greying hair, he takes on the situation that arises in the area, trying his part to be the hero that saves the day. Robards portrays a character that, by only one look at him, we can see how the years have shaped him. His performance is outstanding; we want to grab a drink with Cheyenne, but we also get the feeling that being on your guard around him wouldn't be an overrated luxury.The 'damsel in distress' (although she isn't in the original meaning of the word) Jill McBain (played by Claudia Cardinale) turns into a toy of Fate itself. Without any warning she gets involved in something quite over her head, but she handles it masterfully; she refuses to return to New Orleans with her tail between her legs and stays to face the difficulties put before her. Cardinale playing Jill is both an erotic marvel and a woman you wouldn't want to cross.They are all opposed by Frank (Henry Fonda): the local gang leader with a heart of stone and a business proposal at the ready at all times. With his ruthless blue eyes and his gun at the ready he keeps the town quiet. Fonda gives you the creeps with just one gaze at the camera and every sentence leaves the bitter taste of malfeasance.And finally, Gabriele Ferzetti finishes the line of main characters with his deliciously sickening portrayal of the crippled railroad baron Morton. A character that you'd like to slap in the face, but one you feel pity for as well. Outstandingly brought!The soundtrack is composed by the never beaten maestro of film scoring himself: Ennio Morricone. His genius lies in the creation of themes and melodies that will haunt your dreams forever for better or worse. The melancholic main theme that is brought with a heavenly choir draws tears from your eyes after hearing only a couple of chords. The theme of the man with the harmonica is as unsettling as it is epic and Cheyennes' theme creates the lighter counter points in the movie. Morricone uses these motifs ingeniously, hinting at plot points, character motifs and feelings and giving you a sense of the world the movie takes place in. If I could give twelve out of ten stars for the score, I'd do it.Sergio Leone was a masterful director, no need to prove that. He manages to turn even a scene of seven minutes, where three men are merely waiting for a train, into an epic storyline. Two hours and three quarters the tension builds and then resolves... partially, always building towards the end. And that finale! That finale! That finale chilled me to the bone! Throughout the film, question after question is raised, and when one question is answered, another one pops up. So when all pieces of the puzzle fall into place to the score of Ennio Morricone, how can one not be moved by it?For Leone, there was no better way to reach the top of the Western genre.
And for us, there never will be a film that is more Western than 'Once Upon a Time in the West'.",Once Upon a Time in the West

62,Psycho,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2102488/,"No matter how many times one sits through this Hitchcock classic, Anthony Perkins always manages to surprise you. It is a sensational performance - for which he didn't even get an Oscar nomination - I have no way of knowing how much preparation he dedicated to the creation of Norman Bates, maybe no more than usual, but the details of his performance are astonishing. Never a false move and if you follow the film looking into his eyes, you'll be amazed as I was. The madness and the tenderness, the danger and the cravings. A mamma's boy with hellish implications and yet we see, we feel connected to the human being, we are not horrified by him but of his circumstances. In short, we kind of understand him. That alone puts him miles and miles away from other cinematic monsters. From Richard Attenborough as the real life Christie in ""10 Rillington Place"" to the hideous, unredeemable Christian Bale in ""American Psycho"". Here Hitchcock and Herrman create an universe that Anthony Perkins inhabits with the same kind of electricity, nerve and shyness that Norman Bates projects throughout the film. Janet Leigh falls for it if not him. She, like us, sees the boy trying to escape his dutiful son's trap. He is in my list of the 10 most riveting characters ever to be captured on film.",Psycho
63,Casablanca,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5081531/,"I say a 'simple' story because I am writing this piece after almost 77 years of the film's release, but in 1942, this story would have been quite original and new. The film naturally and flawlessly integrates a moving love story with the War backdrop. Bogart and Bergman make you feel the love through their expressions and emotions. Top-notch acting by the entire cast makes Casablanca one of the masterpieces of the 20th century. The film is crisp and fast and manages to keep you hooked throughout with its thriller element. With so many stories going on, you will be hooked to the screen.",Casablanca
64,Casablanca,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0026277/,"There are literally hundreds of comments about this movie on IMDB.  Many of them exhort its greatness.  I don't disagree with them.But I'd like to add a suggestion to those of you out there who haven't seen this film.  I'd like to tell you HOW to watch it.The people who made this movie didn't think they were producing a masterpiece. Bergman left the shoot disgusted.  The screenwriters were on salary for Warners, writing half a dozen movies a year, and this was just one more.  Bogie was punching the clock in the middle of a workhorse career.So as an audience member, you can't sit down expecting gilded greatness.Don't have a Casablaca party.  Don't watch it on your first date, hoping it will lend that ""Romantic Touch.""  Don't watch it as part of your ""I need to watch the Best 10 movies of all time"" Film School project.Buy this movie on DVD.  Have it at the ready.  And then, one Friday night, when your plans fall through and you find it's 10:30pm and there's nothing on TV that's any good, open a six pack of beer, or pour yourself some wine, and watch this movie in a darkened room.The characters in Casablanca are absolutely devoid of sentimentalism.  Every one of them sees the world without a hint of rose color in their lenses.  As Rick says, ""Three little people don't amount to a hill of beans in this big old world.""  If you're in a mood where you understand what he's saying, watch this movie and it will transport you.There is no single movie that deserves to be called the best movie of all time.  Because movies, when all is said and done, don't amount to a hill of beans.  They are meant to entertain us, not for us to worship THEM.But no movie has ever known this fact like Casablanca.
If you watch Casablance this way, with no expectations, with no ""hype,"" you might catch 10 percent of its greatness on one viewing.  And that will be enough to start you on your way.Happy viewing, kid.",Casablanca
65,Modern Times,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0015336/,"Modern Times owes a lot to Metropolis, despite the difference in tone. You can see this especially in the first half, with the giant gears and flywheels of the monstrous factory, as well as the two-way TV intercom the boss uses to give orders.Although there is a lot of serious content - strikes, riots, poverty, police killings - the serious and comic elements blend seamlessly. You never get the feeling you're being lectured about anything, you're laughing too much.The element of tragedy lurking in the background makes the comedy that much stronger. When Paulette Godard comes into the picture, the tone changes from industrial to romantic. And it must be said that she is one of the sexiest heroines to appear in an American film, more surprising since it's a farce. I'd go so far as to say that Godard out-performs Chaplin in this picture, even if her later career was less notable.You have to see this movie before you can understand anything about the art of cinema.",Modern Times
66,Modern Times,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3431894/,"It is difficult to review Chaplin's movies objectively because many of us have seen them, or at least have heard about them, since we were young. They have become part of our emotional and/or cultural background.Chaplin is arguably the only complete director: in most of his pictures, he also produces, acts, writes the script, composes the music, does his own stunts and edits. His talent and reputation generated numerous commercial successes, even when he continued directing silent movies after their time. ""Talkies"" were the only films produced after 1927, the few silent attempts afterwards were failures; yet Chaplin was an exception: ""City Lights"" in 1931 and ""Modern Times"" in 1936 were sensations worldwide (the latter includes a few sounds but they are marginal). This is remarkable since nine years is an eternity in cinema timeframe. Only in 1940 did Chaplin direct a talkie.COMEDY OR DRAMA?Is the movie a comedy? Partly: tragi-comedy is Chaplin's trademark. In my opinion, there are three levels of humour.1. Pure amusement, sometimes as in slapstick: the tramp eats all he can to be sent to jail and even buys more when he is with the policeman; he is drugged in jail; the tramp and the gamin imagine their life in an idyllic house; the tramp roller-skates close to an edge in the department store (fabulous stunt); he makes a lousy waiter but a great actor at the end. Again, I am not certain how much of the fun is derived from childhood memories and/or the fact we feel younger as we watch the film. To enjoy it fully, we must lay aside some of our adult critical sense, notably towards old-fashioned cinema.2. No humour, just drama: the gamin's father dies; her sisters are taken away; the tramp crashes his way through the crowd to get a job (an efficient illustration of ruthless competition).3. Amusement with a dramatic twist: these are the most frequent scenes, and probably the best. We grin even as we laugh. The movie opens on sheep moving grouped (of which a black one: an allusion to the tramp?), that fade out to workers coming out of the subway. This must have been a shock for the audience during the Great Depression. Another example is one of Chaplin's most famous scenes ever: the tramp tries the eating machine. It is at the same time hilarious (Chaplin really gives all of himself here) and pathetic: a metaphor on ill-conceived progress, oppression of man by machine and conditions of workers obliged to comply with strange requests.Other scenes include: the entire first part in the factory, including when the tramp is stuck in the machine (inside shot, that became iconic), which also happens to a colleague later on (outside shot); the tramp launches by mistake an unfinished ship into the sea, with footage of an actual ship that was probably sunk because of the Depression; the tramp and the gamin make most of their shabby hut.The movie efficiently alternates these three levels of humour, as well as its rhythm. It famously starts as a whirlwind with dynamic tempo and music. And it ends like a roller-coaster: funny musical (the tramp sings), emotional (he is hired), dramatic (the police arrest the gamin), thriller (they run away as climatic music plays), melancholic (they are on the road, free but uncertain). The last image is rightfully double-edged: the tramp and the gamin walk away, but mountains ahead block their road. She looks like an elegant lady, he looks a bit like a clown with his funny walk and big shoes. We don't know where they are going, nor do they.MODERNITYHence Chaplin's ambition was far more than to just divert. Themes depicted eighty years ago are still modern:
Crisis, redundancies, strikes, inequalities, social unrestWorking conditions in factories, even though exaggerated by humour and symbols: productivity, control, burn-outTechnology that dehumanises: chain-working, the eating machine, video surveillance (a science-fiction element at the time). Remarkably, the only sounds of the film are coming from devices, not humans: screen, phonograph, radioSuccess with talent, work and some luckThe law. The topic is prominent (the police are omnipresent) and ambiguous. Can one steal food to survive? Chaplin seems to excuse this behaviour. The tramp is on both sides of the law: he steals food but helps the police arrest villains in jail. And the police's role is complex; notably, they shoot an unarmed man, followed by the ironic card: ""The law takes charge of the orphans""Violence and drugs in prisonThe universal dimension of the movie shows by the fact the main characters have no name: the tramp, the gamin. Chaplin will be blamed for its social topics during the McCarthy era, among other grievances, and he will be forced to exile. Considering it now, this seems ridiculous since the message of the film is not communist: the tramp and the gamin want everything but change society; they search for a job, a home and respect. Note also Lincoln's portrait in the tramp's cell: he is a patriot.The movie does not take sides. Workers can be friendly or violent. Policemen can be friendly (e.g. in jail) or violent (one purposelessly pushes the tramp outside the factory). Prison inmates can be honest (the tramp) or villains. Women can be attractive (the gamin) or not (all others, actually). This double-sidedness also divides individuals. Big Bill was bullying the tramp in the factory, but later sympathises with him. The gamin steals and then becomes settled. The tramp will do anything to protect the ones he loves (the gamin, children), but can abuse almost anybody else to achieve it: a recurrent feature in Chaplin's pictures.The underlying message seems to be: people are not good or bad, it mainly depends on their conditions. Yet another modern theme.",City Lights
67,City Lights,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1693812/,"I always thought this was one of Charlie Chaplin's nicest, most under-appreciated silent movie gems. Then I discovered it really wasn't underrated; it's rated very high on most critics' lists. It may be that I usually hear about some of his other movies than I do this one.Part of the reason I think so highly of this is simply that I'm a sentimentalist and story in this film is a very touching one. It's a romance between Charlie's tramp character (no name) and a blind girl, who also had no name in this film. Virginia Cherill, who played the blind woman and had a wholesome, pretty face which I found very attractive.I'm not always a huge fan of pantomime except for some great comedians of the era like Chaplin, Harold Lloyd and Buster Keaton, but Chaplin was so good at it and this is one of the last of dying breed as ""talkies"" were out in full force by 1931. Chaplin was at his best in silent movies, anyway, and his comedy routines are legendary. He gave me a lot of laughs in this film, as always, and I particularly laughed (I love slapstick) at the boxing scene. Kudos, too, to Harry Myers as the ""eccentric millionaire.""There's a lot of drama as well as humor in this 86-minute gem as the Tramp tries to aid a blind girl, raising money so she can get an operation to restore her sight.Comedy, romance, drama (with suffering) all combine to make this an extraordinary piece of entertainment.

69,Capernaum,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4361678/,"Capharnaum - The MovieNadine Labaki always astonishes me with her work and this is actually my first time ever to write a review about a movie. But this... this is a masterpiece...Capharnaum managed to stir my emotions, it awakened my mind to things we see on a daily basis but decide to ignore. It was a big slap in the face, to be honest. As I watched, I hated myself for having food and shelter. I hated the fact that I paid 14.000 LBPs for my own pleasure and enjoyment to watch a movie. I hated the fact that I bought a $1 worth of pop corn for $7. Why do I get to enjoy a three-hour movie whilst others need that money for a three-day food supply? For those who still haven't seen it, it's a story of a supposedly 12-year old boy who gets sued for stabbing a ""son of a bitch"" (as the boy, Zain describes him). It depicts the life of a typical Lebanese poor family, only if the word poor was enough. It portrays how they eat, how they dress, how they talk and behave and what they do for a living. It was so REAL that I thought it was actual footage from Zain's life. The movie also displays the life of an Ethiopian woman who has no permit and who was knocked up by some guy and gave birth to a baby she can barely support. Oh, speaking of the Ethiopian woman; I was meaning to mention, as soon as the movie starts, we see Zain at court and then we also see the Ethiopian, Tegist with tears in her eyes while waiting for Internal Security to call out her name. At this point I'm really curious as of what this is going to be about and some guy behind me makes a ""funny"" joke about the scene saying ""oh, so the Ethiopian is the star of the movie?""... I don't know why but I thought I'd mention that because it left me in shock... we'll get back to that later. Capharnaum addresses poverty, illiteracy, ignorance, cruelty, racism, unawareness and child abuse. On the other hand, it also addresses kindness, innocence, forgiveness and faith. It is just amazing how Zain worked so damn hard to support Tigest's baby all alone while his parents didn't have a care in the world for their own children. A 12-year old boy taking care of a baby was just so heartwarming and beautiful. 
Zain's personality is amazingly complex and in him one can touch awareness and illiteracy at the same time. Innocence and violence. Politeness and insensitivity. Good and bad. Love and hate. 
He had a vision, he had a message. 
His message was bigger than governments and countries. It was bigger than you and me. It was a message that we decide to laugh about instead of help spread. The message is simplified in one word: AWARENESS.About the guy I mentioned earlier, lets hope he has learned something from the movie...Lets make this movie our prayer before going to bed every night... Then, we could try and change the world to the better.Nadine Labaki keeps on dazzling us with her great work... I can't wait for the next one. We, as Lebanese, are so proud of you. And the whole world should be. Much love.",Capharnaum

And i think it worked.Turkish soldiers who went on a mission for the Korean war were dramatic piece of history. None of us give enough credit for those spared for securing Turkey's position in modern Western World and NATO. But we know these soldiers proved both fearless and humanitarian during their duty. Was it a wise choice to send them and how it resulted? Here is not the place to answer. But we can say this movie was quite numb to the politics of 1950s and took just what it needed from those days.Based on a real story that we heard on TV before, scenario was the strong point of the movie. But instead of giving it the depth and character development it deserved, script plunged into silly sentimentality at all. Ismail Hacioglu, Ali Atay and even Cetin Tekindor failed to deliver something special from their selves. To make things worse like TV series seen on TRT TV like ""Diriliş: Ertugrul"" there were absurd and unrealistic fight scenes, Turkish Airlines and Hyundai ads. There was an irrelevant jump to the 1999 earthquake and scenario felt disconnected.Cinematography was not bad, there were beautiful shots and high quality.

Even going by the Indian cinema standards this is hardly a 7 and nowhere close to being a 8.5 rating, such high ratings to a mediocre movie is an insult to the ones that actually deserve it. The story is unnecessarily stretched out, and many of the sub plots of the movie actually make no sense and doesn't have any effect on the outcome. Like the banter with the Vikram and his wife, has absolutely no effect to the main plot. And whole team is corrupted and accepting bribes and spending lakhs openly, but no one is even raising the question as to how they are getting the money and head of the team who is supposedly smart is absolutely clueless about this happening right in front of him. And Vedha is like, why are the cops only killing my gang members, I don't understand but I'll get arrested and tell the cop who killed my innocent brother a story. Not to forget who easily this movie wants the viewers to sympathise with criminals and gangsters, oh my dear innocent brother was shot, he was no gangster, he just did Hawala, converted black to white.

73,Vikram Vedha,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3764897/,"11 lessons to be learnt from the crime thriller movie ""Vikram Vedha"".1) What you do is always not right. Killed Puli without knowing whether he is a criminal or not, but rewarded him as criminal, who is actually an innocent soul.2) Don't guess things without knowing what exactly happened. Vikram guessed Simon was killed by Vedha because under Simon's order the encounter took place where Puli was shot by him.3) Don't trust anyone who is with you. Vedha and Vedha's brother was targeted to be killed by Ravi. Simon was killed by his own cop brothers. Vikram too was about to be killed by his great cop mates.4) Police are always not right. Criminals are not always wrong.5) You can't guess anyone by seeing their eyes. Vikram didn't believe when Vedha said Simon worked for Ravi. Vikram can't find out his own team mates killed Simon.6) Don't see a thing from one point of view all the time. Vikram had an imagination that Simon was killed by Chandra. But he never had a thought that even his cop friends could have done that for the sake of money.7) Not everyone who helps you is true to you. Vikram's encounter team was helping him to accomplish the task of encountering Vedha. But Vikram never knew they wanted to do this task just for money.8) A person can even act as if he is innocent just to make his job done. The new member of the team acted as if he is innocent to Vikram. In the climax when Vikram asked him to give cover, he pulled off the innocent mask and aimed the gun at Vikram itself.9) Business/work and friendship can't co-exist peacefully. Chetta ordered to kill Chandra because she tried to escape with his money. Ravi wanted to kill Vedha even while working for him.10) Don't relate your personal life with your work. Priya never helped Vikram, when he asked, he wanted to know the place of Vedha. Profession can't be compromised for personal things.11) Criminal/Police have a human heart. Vikram was keen to find Vedha and kill him in an encounter. If not in an encounter, he will escape. But, in the climax the great gangster Vedha helped the true police by saving his life. Vikram shot all his team mates in hands and legs so that they will be alive, but killed the unit head who turned all his friends to work for him.",Vikram Vedha

77,Dangal,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5504574/,"If I would I've seen this movie in 2016, it certainly would have been in my list of best movies. If you're going to this movie thinking Aamir will be flexing and showcasing his acting prowess then well and good but the girls are the highlight of the movie, hands down. SCRIPT - Major props to bringing out a story which is inspiring and one which India needs right now. The story is kept grounded in reality. No over-the-top gimmicks. The songs blend in very well with the premise. None of the scenes linger on for a long period of time. There was a very natural flow to the story which helped engage the audience for 2 hours and 41 minutes. Even movies like Mary Kom or Bhaag Milkha Bhaag started to drag by the end but hats off to Piyush Gupta and Shreyas Jain. I have said this that dialogue shouldn't seem like dialogue unless it is a musical or a re-imagining of a play. The dialogue in this movie is a lesson as to how dialogue should be used. Little nods and grunts and expressions serve more than an explanatory conversation. I am not a fan of narration and I wasn't really liking it here either. It was fine for the light-hearted scenes but the serious scenes required silence but I can give it a pass. The only scene which felt a bit off is where Mahavir gets locked up in a room before the final fight. If it didn't happen in reality then it was really unnecessary. DIRECTION - Chillar Party was a movie with some serious message but was a little preachy and Bhootnath Returns went full preachy. Nitesh Tiwari toned down that preaching to a very natural level in this movie. Every single topic that has happened or still happens in a family was touched upon. Beginning from the sleaziness of men to child-marriage to the sacrifice parents make, everything was utilised to the advantage of the movie. None of that brought the movie to a halt. The first half of the movie had a good amount of comedy and that gelled into the second half with ease. The thing that many might not notice that there are no pay-off scenes except for the last scene. If the audience reaches a peak before the ending then the pay-off wouldn't have a solid effect, if used multiple times. Pay-off scenes are those scenes where the characters are shown to be doing things in extra slow-motion to have an orgasmic effect on the audience and the director cleverly used it at the end in order to give proper tribute to the art and the character. FIGHT CHOREOGRAPHY - This section needed a category of it's own and quite deservedly. I saw Mary Kom, Sultan and Saala Khadoos which had extensive fight scenes and all of the movies had extremely lack-lustre fight scenes. The camera moved too much in order to cover up the actor/actresses' incapability to fight. In comparison to all those movies, here the camera just followed the fighters. No wide-shots of the fight from the audience's perspective because that allows the stunt double to come in. All the fights had the actresses in the scene and hats off to all of them for their dedication. ACTING - Like I said before, the best performance among some amazing performances was of the newcomer Fatima Sana Shaikh. That said, it will really be unjust to name one performance as the best performance because everyone was amazing in this movie. Aamir Khan, Sakshi Tanwar, Sanya Malhotra, Aparshakti Khurana,Zaira Wasim, Suhani Bhatnagar,Ritwik Shore and Girish Kulkarni gave amazing performances. As Aamir had put on so much weight, that altered his physicality a lot which enhanced his performance to another level. Sakshi Tanwar should be doing more movies. She gave a very subdued and nuanced performance. Sanya Malhotra as the grown up Babita had very few scenes but her eyes spoke when she didn't have any dialogue. Zaira Wasim and Sulhani Bhatnagar were awesome, just awesome. I was in awe how they are able to emote so much at their age. Ritwik Shore and Aparshakti Khurana together made Omkar a memorable character. I think they had some of the best scenes in the entire movie. I wanted to kill Girish Kulkarni after Ugly and after this I still want to kill him and that's a compliment. The side actors who formed the audience and little roles like the Dangal organiser and the guy who had sleazy theatre also gave substance to the movie. FINAL VERDICT - I am sure everyone has seen this movie by now and if you haven't then please do. It's a complete movie and it is very rare to see a complete movie, without gimmicks nowadays. I loved how they had such eye for detail because they gave that damaged effect to Aamir's ear. Many wouldn't notice it but it's great to that they did to provide authenticity to the character and the movie. It's a 10/10 for me and one of the best movies of 2016.",Dangal

81,Coco,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4029309/,"Coco tells the story of young boy named Miguel living in Mexico (Coco is his great grandmother). Miguel loves music and must keep his love a secret from his family who has forbidden music of any kind since the days of his great great grandmother. On Día de Muertos, Miguel wants to enter a contest to showcase his musical talent, but his grandmother intervenes, reiterating the family's ban on music. In his hunt for a suitable guitar to play, Miguel finds himself in the land of dead, meeting the spirits of those who have passed on. On his adventure he meets his musical hero, much of his deceased family, and a strange man who asks for his help and quickly becomes a close friend. Along the way, Miguel helps his new friend and his friend helps him understand the true significance of Día de Muertos. Of course, the title character (Coco) turns out to play a vital role before the movie is over. When the moment arrives, she delivers something powerful, and it's beautiful. It moved me in a very satisfying way that felt well-earned and authentic, rather than manipulative, the way many movie moments of this sort feel. Quick sidebar: when I took Spanish in high school, my teachers would occasionally incorporate culture from Spanish-speaking countries (usually Mexico) into the lessons. In some of these lessons, I learned about Día de Muertos. Sort of. I'm not sure if the lessons were lacking or if I just wasn't paying much attention to them. Regardless, I learned more about Día de Muertos from Coco than I did in four years of high school Spanish classes. In high school, my understanding of Día de Muertos was that it was basically a Mexican Halloween. They raised spirits from the dead and played music or something, as I understood it. It seemed silly to me. After watching Coco I realized that the tradition is anything but silly. It's not about the dressing up or the food or the music. It's about family and remembering those that came before us. Leave it to Pixar to not only entertain me, but also educate me about a rich and wonderful tradition of another culture. Bravo!",Coco

85,The Dark Knight Rises,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2645458/,"I came out with slight disappointment after watching DKR for I had huge expectations from Nolan after an exceptional TDK.I am huge fan of first two installment of Batman Trilogy and I liked DKR. It's a good movie but it could have been much better. So rather than discussing its merit, which are many, I am pointing out its shortcomings.It's the weaker than other movies of trilogy and simple reason being it lacks strong characters. DKR is all about storytelling – just like Nolan's Inception but not as efficient. And in doing so it fails where Batman Begins and The Dark Knight had succeeded.Batman Begins was all about fear, doubt, self-realization and redemption where Bruce Wayne discovers his destiny as Batman. BB had a story arc which set background for main characters – Batman/ Wayne, Ra's al Ghul, Gordon (to some extent) and most importantly Gothom City and hence set stage for a fitting climax.The Dark Knight explores the theme of chaos, morality and belief effortlessly and establishes characters of Joker, Harvey Dent/Two Face, Rachel etc. so effortlessly that people choose to ignore even some major plot holes. Heath Ledger's interpretation of Joker was so mesmerizing that it single handily carried TDK to path of greatness/ critical acclaim.But Dark Knight Rises is all about story telling – efficient but not exceptional. Bane, Miranda Tate, John Blake, Peter Folly (Deputy Commissioner), Selina Kyle – characters are introduced but never explored/ expanded - they just start working on their part - just like cogs in the wheel. They are not so much part of the story itself but just the agents which move the story forward.Bane's character is dull and single dimensional and do not evoke any fear or awe. He's meticulous, intelligent and strong and this is established quickly in movie but after that he slumps into a just another movie villain. Taila / Miranda character is never fully explored. Even Wayne/Batman is devoid of any emotions in this one and he feels so sure of himself that I start wondering if it's the same Batman that I saw in first two installments. Only new character which had some shades was that of Selina Kyle and Anne Hathaway did justice to it. Add to that helplessness of Alfred portrayed superbly by Caine. Other actors are good but there's not much for them to do.There's no dilemma,doubt, love, choices, moral battles, hope, even no chaos/fear- things which make characters and plot interesting ( at least for me) and which made Batman Begins and The Dark Knight really good movies. Even the theme of ""Occupy Wallstreet"" is very weak and at best it's closer to London riots with its loot and arsoning. There's even perfect order in Bane's revolution. Movie moves effortlessly from one plot to another and to climax that it become at times predictable.But maybe Dark Knight Rises was supposed to be like that only and Nolan had too much to deal with in 2.5 hours. And maybe that's the main problem with DKR – too much is going on in the story that it seems crammed at times. And when there are too many characters and so many story arcs and it's tough to do justice to characters and story telling at the same time. And this is when you start looking for plot holes, slackness, predictability et al.-----------------some spoilers----------------------- Such as Bane's plan –cement/explosive, Wayne- Miranda's romance, Blake guessing Wayne's personality, Miranda-Talia twist, Batman doing Angels & Demons stunt,Batman's escape from death, Blake as Robin (LOL) and Alfred in last scene.------------------spoilers end -------------------------All movies have a style which depends on story and its story teller. And there' no point of comparing different styles, say that of Starwars, Godfather, Transformers or story tellers say Tarantino, Cameron etc. Whatever maybe the style, good movies play to its strengths – story/screenplay, characters, style, pace or all. Try to recall some good movies and think what you like the most.Dark Knight Rises have a good story but lacks strong characters and relies Inception's style which incidentally differs from style of first two installments of Batman Trilogy. And for me, soul of Nolan's Batman Series is its strong characters, their underlying emotions and a theme which is much deeper and meaningful than all fight, gadgetry and style. And this is where DKR fails. 7/10",The Dark Knight Rises

87,3 Idiots,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2437714/,"It's hard for me to review this film, as I have not seen a huge number of Indian films--probably no more than a couple dozen. Most of the ones I've seen were wonderfully entertaining but I am far from an expert on Bollywood. Because of this, I have a hard time knowing how good this film is relative to other films from this country. So, consider this when you read this review. This may be among the very best India has to offer or it just seems that way to me.Like so many Indian films, this is a very, very long film--with a run-time of almost three hours. When a movie is bad or just okay, this can seem like forever, but since ""3 Idiots"" is a very, very good film I loved its length. And, like most films of the genre, it has its share of the usual singing and dancing so foreign to films from other countries. One thing you should know, however, is that defining the type of film it is isn't really easy. Much of it is a comedy, but it also has many poignant moments (keep the Kleenex nearby), some existential moments where they explore the meaning of life and work and it's also a tender film about friendship. And, as my daughter pointed out when she saw the film, she loved that the men in the movie are not afraid to cry--something you rarely see in western films.As for the plot, it's very long and involved and I could recount what occurs. But I don't want to spoil a single wonderful moment, so my advice is just sit back and watch--and if you give it a chance, I can almost guarantee you'll have a great time with this poignant and funny film. Wonderful and well worth your time--with a delightful script, wonderful characters and lots of moments that made me smile...and a few that brought me to tears. See this film.",3 Idiots
88,Taare Zameen Par,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2500742/,"As I just became aware of this film a few weeks ago, and ordered a DVD and watched it today (10-9-11) this review is unlikely to be seen by many because the film is 4 years old and there are nearly 250 user reviews already. So rather than rehash the plot, I will first mention that I have been an Educational Therapist for over 45 years, and have worked extensively with dyslexic and ADD and ADHD children in my practice, so this film had intrinsic interest to me going in. But despite seeing many films on learning problems through the years, some very good, I have never seen any movie that can come close to this one both in emotional power and subject accuracy. When I saw that the film is 165 minutes long, I was expecting to watch it in two sittings, but I never once felt the need to take a break, and in the second half of the film, when the director Aamir Khan enters the story, I was riveted continuously, and embarrassingly shed more than a few tears. If you have any interest in education and the problems the outsiders face, this is a must-see. And if you just want to see an intelligent drama with no car chases, explosions, sex scenes, or ultra violence, then you will be glad you saw this wonderful film, which, by the way, while it is about children, is not really for children, unless they are over about 11 or 12, or have suffered the experience of failing due to undiagnosed or treated reading or similar learning difference. Don't let the Disney Studio name fool you, this does not feel like a typical Disney movie, but the film does point out that Walt Disney himself had school learning problems as a child. Another aspect of the film is something I always try to impart to my clients: There is life after school. And it is not necessary to be the best at everything to be successful. Just become the best you are able and try to find something you like doing that makes you happy.The rest will take care of itself.

90,The Lives of Others,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1379708/,"Because this movie deals with recent German history, some German comments about it get sidetracked into minute historical discussions. Forget them; Das Leben der Anderen is an outstanding movie that should be seen everywhere.The former East Germany, a relatively small country of 16 million people, was controlled by the most sophisticated, cunning, and thorough secret police the world has ever seen, the East German Ministerium für Staatsicherheit, or ""Stasi."" The Stasi had about 90,000 employees -- a staggering number for such a small population -- but even more importantly, recruited a network of hundreds of thousands of ""unofficial employees,"" who submitted secret reports on their co-workers, bosses, friends, neighbors, and even family members. Some did so voluntarily, but many were bribed or blackmailed into collaboration.Das Leben der Anderen, (""The Life of Others"") German director Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck's debut, builds this painful legacy into a fascinating, moving film. In its moral seriousness, artistic refinement, and depth, Das Leben der Anderen simply towers over other recent German movies, and urgently deserves a wide international release. The fulcrum of the movie (but probably not its most important character) is Georg Dreyman, an up-and-coming East German playwright in his late 30s. Played by the square-jawed Sebastian Koch, Dreyman is an (apparently) convinced socialist who's made his peace with the regime. His plays are either ideologically neutral or acceptable, and he's even received State honors.Although he is a collaborator, he is also a Mensch. He uses his ideological ""cleanliness"" to intervene on behalf of dissidents such as his journalist friend Paul Hauser (Hans-Uwe Bauer). These unfortunates must contend with every humiliation a totalitarian state can invent: their apartments are bugged, friends and family are recruited to inform on them, and chances to publish or perform can be extinguished by one stray comment from a Central Committee member. The most recalcitrant can be kicked out of the country and stripped of their citizenship, like the singer songwriter Wolf Biermann.Dreyman lives in a shabby-genteel, book-filled apartment with his girlfriend Christa-Maria Sieland (Martina Gedeck), a renowned actress who often appears in his plays. At the beginning of the movie, Dreyman himself comes under the regime's suspicion, for reasons that become clear only later. The fearful machinery of the Stasi rumbles to life: his movements are recorded, and his apartment bugged. The Stasi had bugging down to a science: a team of meticulously-trained agents swoop into your apartment when you're not there, install miniscule, undetectable listening devices in every single room -- including the bathroom -- and vanish in less than an hour, leaving no trace. Agents set up an secret electronic command post nearby, keeping a written record of every joke, argument, or lovemaking session.The ""operative process"" against Dreyman is overseen by Stasi captain Gerd Wiesler, played by Ulrich Mühe, an actor from the former East who was himself once in the Stasi's cross-hairs. Captain Wiesler starts the film as a colorless, icy, tight-lipped professional who shows no mercy in fighting the ""enemies of socialism"": if he needs to interrogate a suspect for 10 hours without sleep to get a confession, he will do so -- and then place the seat-cover the suspect sat on in a vacuum jar in case the miscreant should later need to be tracked by bloodhounds. At night, Captain Wiesler returns to his tiny apartment in an grubby, anonymous high-rise. He settles himself among his inexpressibly drab furniture, eats a meal squeezed out of a plastic tube while watching reports about agricultural production, and then goes to bed alone.As Captain Wiesler listens to Dreyman and his girlfriend he begins to like them, or perhaps envy the richness and depth of their lives in comparison with his own. Perhaps he also begins to wonder why a stranger should have the right to become privy to Dreyman's most intimate secrets: his occasional impotence, his girlfriend's infidelities, his artistic crises. At the same time, though, Wiesler is under pressure: a Central Committee official has made it clear to Wiesler and his toadying supervisor Lieutenant Colonel Grubitz (Ulrich Tukur), that Dreyman has to go down. I won't discuss more plot details, as there are unexpected twists. Each of the main characters is drawn deeper into the conflict between Dreyman and the State, and each is torqued by loyalty conflicts that intensify as the pressure increases. The cast is outstanding. Sebastian Koch finds the right combination of poetic detachment and watchful sophistication for Dreyman. Martina Gedeck, as his girlfriend, has the most challenging role, since she's buffeted from all sides: by her suspicious partner, by Stasi agents trying to turn her, and by a lecherous Culture Minister. Ulrich Mühe plays the Stasi agent's transformation with reserve, only hinting at the stages in his character's secret, but decisive, change of heart.Director von Donnersmarck, a blue-blooded West German, has re-created the gray, drained look of the former East, and the nature of Stasi intimidation, with a fidelity that has earned the praise of East Germans. His pacing is relaxed, but doesn't drag; although there are a few longueurs, most scenes unfold at just the right pace, and there are several great set-pieces. One is a bone-rattling episode in the Stasi canteen in which a young recruit is caught telling a joke about East German premier Erich Honecker. Another is the penultimate scene, a masterstroke in which Dreyman gains access to his massive Stasi file, while reading it, suddenly understands episodes of his own life which had never made sense to him before. The ending is perfectly judged; bittersweet and moving without swelling strings or teary confessions.Das Leben der Anderen is an outstanding movie, probably a great one. If it's not picked up for international distribution, it will be a bitter loss for thousands of potential moviegoers in other countries.","The official title of the movie is ""Das Leben der Anderen"" (The Lives of Others)"
91,Memento,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0665203/,"If you hate reality-based film-making this is awful. If you hate Film Noir, this is ugly. But for me, Nolan has convinced me he is one of the most important directors out there. I was even thinking, ""It must be easy to edit a movie so that it's all backwards."" But it's not, it's not any easier - and he leaves you straining and watching from scene to scene, searching for the truth. Even the final revelation will affect each viewer and leaves them searching for their own ""ultimate truth"" according to their own experience.Most people comment about manipulation in connection with this movie, but after watching the last scene, I'm convinced that manipulation is not the main theme at all. I don't want to spoil it for you, but the basis of unfolding backwards in time is that you are enlisted to scrutinize the film trying to discover some set of motivations behind each character's actions later in time that makes sense.

Most reviews (including ones on this site) will tell you waaayyyy too much about the movie, and that's just plain frustrating.

This is a highly intelligent and original brain teaser that will have you guessing from beginning to end, and even afterwards.  The story and the direction are the best I've seen so far this year, and it deserves all the kudos it gets.Plainly put, the film tells the story of Leonard Shelby:  a man who lost his short term memory in an assault where his wife was raped and murdered;  now he's looking for the killer, despite his handicap.  Simple as that.  You don't need to know anymore.The film is constructed and told in such a way that you are constantly put into the shoes of Leonard Shelby, beautifully played by Guy Pierce. Carrie-Ann Moss gives an equally mysterious and complex performance.  This film is well-made all the way around--from the direction, to the editing, and especially the unique story that is rarely found in Hollywood these days.

93,Princess Mononoke,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1641659/,"A few years ago I would have tossed this film into a collection of movies I like to call the rubbish pile. Recently, however, I have forced myself, with great difficulty, to open my mind and look at the entire picture. Instead of focusing on one or two aspects of the movie I do not like and formulating a biased opinion based on my hasty and clouded notions, I can now decipher both the good and bad points of a given flick. Upon watching Princess Mononoke, I must say I first thought it would be very difficult to look past the animation style and see it for what it was- a dynamic film directed be the highly acclaimed Hayao Miyazaki. After about ten minutes of dwelling on the follies (and there are, in my opinion, many) of the ""anime"" style of art, I became enthralled with the quickly unfolding plot and the subsequently dire fate bestowed upon Ashitaka, the protagonist of the film. After Ashitaka leaves his village to search for a treatment to remedy his affliction, I no longer cared that this was an animated feature; I was on the edge of my seat, wondering what would happen next. I no longer disliked that every character had abnormally large eyes (though not over-sized to the point of utter absurdity) or that the English overdubbing was a little choppy. In fact, I even began to enjoy the accomplished yet subtle computer generated effects interspersed throughout. By the last half hour I was hooked to the screen, eagerly awaiting the conclusion I wanted so badly to end the bitter conflict of the plot. By the end, I realized that this movie carried a powerful moral with it: man's continuous tampering with nature brings about as much savagery as it does progress, as much suffering as it does good, and that a sound compromise must be struck between nature and civilization. I do not harbor any negative feelings towards those who rated this movie poorly, as I used to be one of those people. All I have to say to them is this: look at a both the visual and symbolic attributes of a movie before rating it harshly. If, after observing all these features and idiosyncrasies, you still wholeheartedly hate the film, then by all means give it a one.

94,Princess Mononoke,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0426522/,"This seems to be Miyazake's most personal work, clearly a serious design. It is set in an imaginary time which blends the time of the ancient gods (Shinto style, gods of place and nature) with the settlement of humans and the coming of metalworking and war.  The world is not in balance, and a distant conflict between industry and nature has wounded one of the gods of the forest, which is then killed by a sentry boy as it rampages into farmland he guards.  The evil controlling it transfers to him, beginning a slow takeover, and he must journey to the origin of the conflict to find a way to cure himself and incidentally, as he will learn, to try to restore balance.  But this is not a simplistic tale, he finds there are other characters in play, and there is good and evil in everyone, and no easy balance.  The Princess (Hime) of the story is a mysterious human who has been raised by wolves (which are themselves powerful forest gods, a little reminiscent of the Amerindian Coyote myth), who becomes both his ally and his enemy.  The story is not easy to understand.  It has many Japanese mythic elements but even then, it is a work of Miyazake's unique imagination, and is not intended to be simple or to have a clean resolution.The animation is spectacular, and unusual, with new elements even for Miyazake and marks a new departure for style which you can see continued in his next film, Sen to Chihiro - more nature, more wild, more jamming on elements from Japanese myth and folklore.  And, continuing the trend to be more personal, concerned with ethics and character, and less sci-fi. There are at least half a dozen well developed characters threaded through the story, and their animation is wonderful in displaying subtle character.The original Japanese soundtrack has some amazing singing and draws upon some of the best talent available for voices - in Japan, Miyazake is universally known and this was a masterpiece carefully crafted.  Japanese television documented a lot of the production.  The English translation drew on some good talent but they seem not to have ""gotten it"" quite so intensely as the Japanese crew.If you haven't seen Miyazake, give it a try (but maybe look at Sen to Chihiro first, or even Laputa or Kiki's Delivery Service, for easier and lighter introduction to his work).  Some say he is the Japanese Disney, but I don't like that.  His work has a depth and sophistication that goes beyond Disney cute.  There is no other animation like it.  This is truly an adult work: children might like some of the visuals, but I doubt that many kids below teen age will have any idea what it is all about, and even adults will get more out of this each time you see it again.",Princess Mononoke

This movie is unbelievably boring it is like watching a snail run the 100 yard dash. By the end of the four hours I couldn't care less about what happened to any of the characters.

96,Once Upon a Time in America,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0213795/,"Many people compare ""Once Upon a Time in America"" with ""The Godfather"". In my opinion these two movies can't be compared. Both are masterpieces in their own way, but each of them has a different style. You don't compare a Picasso to Michelangelo's Sixteen Chapel either, do you?What is it that makes this movie a masterpiece? Well, first of all there is the director. Sergio Leone is a real master when it comes to creating a special atmosphere, full of mystery, surprises and drama... He's one of the few directors who understands the art of cutting a movie in such a way that you stay focused until the end. The way the movie was cut is also the reason why a lot of Americans don't think this movie is very special. There are three versions, but only the European version is how the director imagined it to be. He didn't want his movie to be shown in chronological order (1910's - 1930's - 1960's), but wanted to mix these three periods of time. The studio cut the movie in chronological order, loosing a lot of its originality and therefor getting a lot of bad critics. If you want to see this film the way Sergio Leone saw it, you have to make sure you get the director's cut. The second reason why this movie is so great is the music. Ennio Morricone, who is seen as the greatest writer of film music ever, did an excellent job. Together with the images, the music speaks for itself in this movie. From time to time there isn't said a word, but the music and the images on their own tell the story. He understood perfectly what Sergio Leone wanted and composed most of the music even before the movie was shot.Last but not least there is also the acting and the script. The actors all did an excellent job. But what else can you expect from actors like Robert De Niro, Joe Pesci... They helped making this movie as great as it is by putting there best effort in it. The script helped them with it. It took twelve years to complete, but it hasn't left any detail untouched. The writers really thought of everything when creating it.I can really recommend this movie to everyone, but especially to people who like the gangster genre. When you want to see the movie, you better be sure that you will have the time for it. This isn't a movie that is finished after 90 minutes. You'll have to be able to stay focused during 3 hours and 47 minutes, which will certainly not be easy during the first 20 to 30 minutes. Some scenes at the beginning only make sense when you have seen the end of the movie. But when you are able to stay focused, you'll find this one of the best movies you've ever seen. I certainly did and I rewarded it with a well deserved 10/10.",Once Upon a Time in America
97,Indiana Jones and the Raiders of the Lost Ark,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0985227/,"The Indiana Jones series was the best series ever made, in my opinion. It was extremely fun and enjoyable to watch and it can be watched repeatedly, with no lesser joy. Harrison Ford as Indy is extremely charismatic, like Han Solo, but the character of Indiana for me has an essence that creates a more likable character (modesty, I think) and by doing that, it creates a better trilogy for me, indeed surpassing the Original Star Wars Tilogy (don't get me wrong I love Star Wars as well).Raiders is such a great film, containing some great action scenes (the Truck scene) and creating Indiana Jones, which is the best adventure hero ever made, partly I think due to Harrison Ford (I don't think these movies would have been as good with Tom Selleck).",The official title of the movie is Indiana Jones

Too much CGI makes everything possible and therefore very often also arbitrary.

But lots of good and variable action scenes are accompanied by a story that develops fast and excitingly and is always close to being implausible but luckily never is. Spielberg, Lucas and most of all Harrison Ford created a hero that is nowadays iconic. With their attempt to make an homage to adventure comics of the 1930's they created their own legend.

99,The Shining,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0179913/,"Stephen King may have said the master director knew nothing about horror, but that simply is not true. That is a too biased opinion for anyone to go on given that he wrote the book, which Kubrick based his wonderful film ever so loosely on. And at any rate, faithful or not, KUBRICK's Shining-the BEST crafted genre film of the 80's- performs it's duty as a fright flick, and then some.There are appropriately no words strong enough to convey the haunting beauty of the visuals showcased throughout the movie, from the drive to the Overlook to the final chase in the hedgemaze the movie is a feast for the eyes as it is for the mind. And it IS a feast for the mind as The Shining is as psychological as horror gets, toying relentlessly, and expertly with your emotions and expectations(some could even say SADISTICALLY), throwing something in that's completely out of left field and never, ever letting you catch your breath between the now classic shocks as the movie speeds toward it's memorable conclusion in the last half hour.Kudos are in order for Kubrick, a director of the old school style, who builds an eerie atmosphere by exercising total control over the filmic environment, manipulating everything down to the tiniest detail to suit the needs of the picture, yet filming with a coldly detatched, objective eye, as though Kubrick were making a documentary about these events. This would account for the dialouge, which-thankfully-is not the typical phoney balloney Hollywood banter (Kubrick detractors/King purists usually bitch about this the most, having been weaned on the phony nature of 'Hollywood talk', which is usually nothing at all like real talk. Many of us speak 'on the nose', and do not try to convey subtext through use of carefully chosen words that articulate our state of being without being direct.) In this light, Shelley Duvall must be commended for her performance which is very naturalistic. It does not seem like acting at all. She is not concerned with glamour, nor does she clutter her performance with typical acting chops, but rather she is solely focussed on hitting the emotional highpoints of her character as 'Wendy' gradually comes to realize that her husband is a madman. And let's face it folks, how many of us would like a million bucks when placed in a situation like that? Who does NOT look like a blubbering idiot when they are hysterical? That's what I thought, so what did you expect? She was great. To say nothing of the rest of the cast.",The Shining
100,Apocalypse Now,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1605653/,"Films like ""apocalypse now"", ""the godfather"" and ""the deer hunter"" all have a somewhat similar feel to them.

But I see there are plenty of others here who feel exactly the same as I do, thank god. It's very hard to comprehend how films that are regarded as the best appear to me as some of the worst I've ever seen.I honestly don't know what to say. It really was that much of a snooze-fest for me. The only feelings I can describe to you of me watching the film, was boredom and me thinking about cutting the hedges back at the farm I help out on tomorrow morning.

I only have faint memories of having watched parts of this movie from my mom's lap when she and dad were watching this in the theater. The other reason why I decided to check this out was a Super-bowl half-time debate on whether Amitabh was better than Rajesh Khanna. I could not participate in this debate for two reasons: first, I was eagerly awaiting another ""wardrobe malfunction"" for one of the cheerleaders and secondly, I only had memories of one Rajesh Khanna movie, Haathi Mere Saathi. I remember having enjoyed it very much as a child. But that alone was not enough to quantify anything. The more recent performances of AB were fresh in my mind, but after having seen this movie, I decided that Rajesh had a class of his own. His chirpy performance in this movie is really unparalleled! What an amazing performance! Amitabh, being more junior, has not equaled Rajesh, but has done his share very well. Thus, even after watching this movie, the debate will continue.What's New? What can possibly be new in an old movie? Guess what? there is plenty for the younger generation to take away! There is no education in the movies these days, whatsoever, except perhaps bedroom or bar sequences. The inadequacies in the field of medicine are so nicely brought forward by this movie, which is certainly over 30 years old! Now, I can understand why Munnabhai MBBS was such a hit. It had so beautifully adapted from this movie to match the present generation. Kudos to Vidhu Vinod Chopra and Sanjay Dutt (& Kamal Hassan too) for carrying this forward.Noticeable: ""BaaabuMushaai"", the nick name for Amitabh, as heard from Rajesh throughout the movie, will ring in your ears even hours after you have seen the six letters ""The End"" on the screen. There really is no end to such people! Some sequences were simply amazing. Those that stood apart in my mind were the last scene, with a tape that had a significant pause in between; the moun-vrath guru, who so symbolically said that there is so much more than the decaying body to Anand's soul; then of course the Munirbhai sequences and the eventual backfiring of this strategy and so many more! The songs were so gentle and heart warming! The comic timing of Rajesh Khanna was simply amazing! Verdict Present day filmmakers really need to rework their brains and start thinking much much better! There is much more to Hindi cinema than just skin-show and catchy item number songs. This is a MUST-WATCH movie! I did not think so when others told me, but having experienced it myself, I believe them! I am gonna check out the other MUST-WATCH movies prescribed by the previous generation.",Anand
103,High and Low,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5700372/,"There are many reasons why I don't fancy japanese movies and the most famous person in its cinema industry, Mr Akira Kurosawa, but there are way more reasons not to pay any attention to that fact. I've heard lots of favorable reviews and pleasant words about Kurosawa since I just started getting into the world of movies over 20 years ago and it took me almost as much to watch the first one of his works - ""Seven samurai"" (1954) which I found pretty boring at times, considering its length of over 3 hours, but very entertaining nonetheless. After that I knew where most of the Hollywood directors took the inspiration for their big budget ensemble cast blockbuster movies throughout the years - it was Kurosawa they were trying to copy and pay homage to. After a streak of less impressive movies of his I've discovered ""The hidden fortress"" (1958) which saw the director take a somewhat different approach and the comedy direction he had chosen I liked in an instant but once again it was overly long - the fact that didn't allow me to enjoy the movie at its fullest.With this masterpiece I am concluding my acquaintance with Akira Kurosawa's pictures and who would have thought this would turn out to be his best in my opinion. ""High and low"" (which in a more literal translation means ""heaven and hell"") is yet again long, 2 hours and 23 minutes but it doesn't seem to be long one bit this time. Why? Because everything falls into place and step by step leads the narrative to the ending very smoothly.I was relieved to see Kurosawa finally move forward, further from samurai movies he was notoriously known for before and it surely played its hand this time. The story revolves around a self-made man and the choice he had to make to either give up everything he's got or save a little boy's life - and it was only half of the movie; the other half is a well thought out detective story that considers every aspect of the crime committed and observes every little detail in search of the criminal.This movie is not only the best example of a police procedural but of a drama also and it should be remembered as such for many generations to come.",High and Low
104,High and Low,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0083652/,"""High and Low"" is one of those deceptive detective-thrillers that sneak in under your radar and grab you from behind with their storytelling magic. It's proof positive of Kurosawa's mastery of film and all its imagery.The story was adapted from an Ed McBain ""87th Precinct"" novel, ""King's Ransom"", and is really very simple. A successful businessman (Mr. Gondo) in the middle of a major deal is told his son has been kidnapped. All concerns about money fly out the window...until Gondo learns it was actually his chauffeur's son who was taken by mistake. Doesn't matter; the kidnapper still wants him to pay the ransom, even though it will bankrupt him. Will Gondo destroy his standing in the business world to save the life of a child that is not even his? Or will he just leave it to the police and fate to determine whether the child lives or dies? This makes up the first half of the film.The second half deals with the search for the kidnapper and his accomplices, and it does not shy away from showing how dull and grueling good police work is. Step by step, the cops narrow their field of suspects and build their evidence to link their prey to murder as well as the kidnapping, meaning he would face execution. This makes up the second half of the film.It helps to know that in the original story, the businessman refuses to pay the ransom but does help the police track down the kidnappers. It also helps to understand that in Japan, working your way up from making shoes and satchels by hand to being in a position where you could wind up owning the company is a HUGE accomplishment in a caste driven society. It means he is due additional respect, and this is what Gondo faces losing if he pays the ransom, which is far more important than the fact that he will be driven into bankruptcy. From the first scene through an amazingly exciting section on a bullet train to the ending moments between Gondo and the kidnapper, Kurosawa shows exactly why he is a master of cinema. To take what is basically an episode of ""Law and Order"" and make it into a meditation on the meaning of life and evil is not something just any film school twit could do.To me, the best moment on a human level comes when Gondo descends the stairs the morning after the kidnapping to explain to the police why he cannot pay the ransom for a child not even his. You can see the man realizing he is allowing himself go to hell in order to protect his family and station in life, and Toshiro Mifune underplays it beautifully...and Kurosawa lets it just simply happen. Wonderful.THIS is the movie Mel Gibson's ""Ransom"" wishes it had been. something real and human and meaningful instead of merely kick-ass.Ten out of ten stars.",High and Low
105,Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3775061/,"Stanley Kubrick's wickedly hilarious end-of-the-world black comedy gem about an impending nuclear war caused by human error straddles a fine line between being fiercely funny and genuinely chilling throughout: As evident by the gross behavior and arrogant attitudes of various high-ranking officials in positions of power that they are neither smart nor mature enough to properly handle, the greatest threat to mankind's safety isn't the existence of nuclear weapons; instead it's such all too real and unavoidable human foibles as pride, stupidity, and incompetence that we should all be more worried about.The savagely mocking script by Kubrick, Peter George, and Terry Southern pulls zero punches in its no-holds-barred satirizing of said foibles and offers numerous uproarious moments of inspired dark humor: The meek and ineffectual President Merkin Muffley (Peter Sellers in one of three bravura performances) informing the drunken Soviet premier over the phone about the nuclear strike, the hysterically loony speech made by unhinged paranoid General Jack D. Ripper (robustly played with snarly aplomb by Sterling Hayden) about preserving his precious bodily fluids, gung-ho redneck bomber pilot Major 'King' Kong (a marvelously spirited portrayal by Slim Pickens) riding a nuclear missile like a bucking bronco on its final drop while whooping it up, and the gloriously insane plan for survival that batty ex-Nazi adviser Dr. Strangelove (Sellers again at his most sublimely deranged) proposes to President Muffley.Moreover, the zestful acting from the first-rate cast keeps this movie humming: Sellers pulls off a terrific troika of impressive and highly distinctive turns as Muffley, Strangelove, and uptight RAF group captain Lionel Mandrake, George C. Scott has a field day as bellicose commie-bashing hawk General 'Buck' Turgidson, Keenan Wynn does his usual sturdy work as the gruff Colonel 'Bat' Guano, Peter Bull likewise excels as the shifty Russian ambassador Alexi de Sadesky, Tracy Reed briefly steams things up as sexy secretary Miss Scott, and James Earl Jones handles himself well in his film debut as the thorough Lieutenant Lothar Zogg.

What a terrific, pitch black satire. This film is so wild and mean and funny - and Peter Sellers gives THE performance of his career. Unlike in any of Kubrick's later works, there's a sense of playfulness here that gives the whole movie a crazy kind of energy; I'm guessing that Seller's love for improvisation forced Kubrick to ditch his usual perfectionism to a certain degree (and the film is all the better for it).

This is a masterpiece of human maneuvering. It has outstanding acting and a plot to die for. This is a fairly pedestrian Agatha Christie short story. I'm not saying it's not a wonderful story, just that it doesn't come to life like it does on the screen. Charles Laughton is the wonder barrister who is taking the case, even though he is in poor health. The murder case seems a relatively simple one until we begin to trip over the many layers left lying on the path. Marlene Dietrich does a masterful job in all her roles (I won't say anymore than that so I don't spoil the ending). Tyrone Power is able to balance his pathos and his potential guilt. The beauty of the movie is that it never takes itself too seriously. There are some modestly funny subplots and a great deal of careful investigation.

Suspend your disbelief for a couple of hours and enjoy this banquet of a romp. Charles Laughton showed here what he was made of better, more clearly and more loudly than in any other film and all of his films, at least the moments with him in it, are unforgettable - Captain Blight or Henry VIII, Quasimodo or that malefic Senator from South Carolina. Here the severity of his lawyer by vocation takes your senses away with his masterful judicial way to see logic and it's such an incredible fun to watch him do it.

The film's title, ""The Path to Glory,"" echoes the film's expression, which is the ultimate satire on this route to military advancement. Kubrick showed a very strong grasp of details in this film. Many characters left a deep impression on people, and these details echoed each other and corresponded to the expression, which is really a reflection of a director's strong ability.",The Path to Glory
110,Paths of Glory,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0062202/,"At only 29 years of age and in only his second major studio release, Stanley Kubrick showed the world that he was a force to be reckoned with. By the time he died 42 years later his films were epochal events waited for breathlessly by his large band of devotees who considered him a director without equal. He seldom disappointed them.This movie is set in World War I amidst the incredibly destructive and futile trench warfare between France and Germany. Kirk Douglas plays Frenchman Colonel Dax, who is ordered to make an impossible assault on a heavily-fortified enemy position. The only reason this charge is being made is that his commanding general, played by George Macready, believes that capturing the position will earn him a promotion. When the assault does not go forward under heavy enemy bombardment, the general is infuriated and demands that three men be arbitrarily chosen to stand trial for cowardice, an offense punishable by death. Col. Dax defends these men at their court-martial.The battle and trial scenes are about as good as have ever been filmed and the high level of tension is sustained throughout the movie. After the film's climax has occurred, Col. Dax goes looking for his troops and finds them relaxing at a cafe. What he and the viewer witness there is possibly the most affecting scene I've ever seen on screen.Looking at this film in perspective, it's easy to see Kubrick's trademarks even at this early stage of his career. The attention to the composition of his shots reflects his background as a still photographer and foreshadows his other great films to come. I find myself most impressed today with the way he could handle a dramatic story like this one without any innovative techniques or unusual special effects to hide behind, then turn around and make such totally different films like '2001...' and 'Dr. Strangelove...' Other films like 'The Shining' and 'Barry Lyndon' combined a strong story line with breakthrough film techniques. His versatility astonishes me.Adolphe Menjou also stars as the general who convinces Dax's superior officer to risk the ill-fated charge. Ralph Meeker, Timothy Carey and Joe Turkel give strong performances as the men on trial. Turkel turns up 23 years later in another Kubrick film, 'The Shining,' playing the bartender.You can take your pick: 'Paths of Glory' can rightly be described as one of the greatest war movies of all, or one of the great anti-war films, or as one of Kubrick's best.

She lives in a crumbling old mansion with her butler Max (Erich von Stroheim). She refuses to believe that she's no longer remembered and will never make another movie. She gets Gillis to stay with her and rewrite ""Salome"" which she thinks will be her comeback. Gillis has no other choice and things slowly get out of hand.A VERY cynical view of Hollywood--especially for 1950. It shows what Hollywood does to people like Norma--it makes them stars, tells them that they're great and dump them coldly when they're no longer needed. It also takes swipes at directors, agents, screenwriters, even entire studios! It has a tight quick script, is appropriately filmed in gloomy black and white and is masterfully directed by Billy Wilder. Everybody thought this was a bad idea when it was being made. It was believed to be too cold and vicious for the public. Also Holden was warned it would ruin his career by playing a younger man kept by an older woman. But it turned out great and is now rightfully considered a classic.The acting is almost all good. I never thought Nancy Olson was that good. Her character is too pure and sweet to be believable. Everybody else is right on target though. Holden is just great in his role. You see the pity, anger and helplessness on his face when he realizes Norma is falling in love with him--and he's trapped. von Stroheim was equally good as Max who encourages Norma's delusions. Swanson however is just magnificent! She has a very showy role and could have overplayed it--but she doesn't. She's mad for sure--but you only see it peeking through every once in a while. When she loses it completely at the end it's frightening. If she had played it like that all through the movie it never would have worked.

114,The Great Dictator,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4864774/,"To call ""The Great Dictator"" an excellent film would be an understatement. It is one of the masterpieces of classic cinema brought to us by a Hollywood pioneer and one of the most beloved people of the 20th century. It is a satire of Nazi Germany released in the height of their power and the invasion of Europe. A slap in the face of tyranny and bloodthirsty rulers all across the globe, but particularly aimed at Nazi Germany. Even thought it has such a serious theme the movie is still filled to the brim with laughs and shenanigans that can only be delivered by Chaplin. It shows you the absurdness of fascism and Nazism by openly lampooning its philosophy and its leaders, but also it has a subtle message of terror showing us what happens when such people get in place of power. It all culminates with one of the most iconic speeches in cinematic history that resounds with people all around the globe to this day. A must watch for any fan of comedy, history and cinema!",The Great Dictator
115,The Great Dictator,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1005305/,"I was surprised and impressed to find out this movie was released in 1940, before the United States entered World War II. On the surface, satirizing something as solemn and horrible as Nazi Germany could be misconstrued as rash. But Chaplin's brilliance isn't limited to making a joke out of everything. In fact, the seriousness of his message wouldn't have been nearly as valid if not for the excellent use of humor in this movie along with the moments of stark drama blended in. Drama alone wouldn't have had the bite and resonance that this film did. Laughing at someone (Adenoid Hynkel) can be the best way to attack them, while laughing with someone (the Jewish Barber) can be the best way to love them. In the Jewish Barber's final speech, I forgot for a moment that the war he was talking about happened more than half a century ago. They are words that have meaning now, and in any time of war. For this reason I believe the film did far greater good than harm, as it still has the same profound effect today.",N/A
116,1917,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5414373/,"I knew nothing of the film heading into the theatre other than it was based on WW1.Cinematography, lighting, yes brilliant. That of course doesn't make a film deserve an 8.7 rating.This is a war film for the Marvel generation. There is limited emotion shown by the main characters, scenes that suspend reality and cliche, cliche, cliche.Our hero finds a bucket of unspoilt milk at an abandoned farmhouse beside the only cow in sight.A trip wire is tripped by a rat in a bunker in which the two soldiers are in, one is in scratched while the other is buried under rubble, He is dragged out of the rubble with not a scratch, only to have some dust in his eyes. Yet the explosion was so significant it forces the entire large bunker to collapse.Our hero is shot at by a sniper while crossing the bridge. I thought at this point that we finally might be able to see a tense scene. In other good war films this game of cat and mouse might have lasted several minutes. No need. Our hero somehow immediately locates the position of the sniper and is able to shoot and would him. Stunning marksmanship.Yet only two scenes later our hero is running through a town in rubble being shot at by German soldiers no more than 20 yards away and isn't hit.The worst part though, even worse than the tacky scene with the French woman and child, is his escapade down the river, through the rapids, and down a waterfall only the exit the river right at the point at which the battalion he was attempting to locate is luckily only 15 yards away.Things just seem to randomly work out for our hero, and quickly. There needed to be a few sequences where the hero is faced with the enormity of the situation, loneliness, desolation. Rather each time one chapter is finished he is immediately assisted in movies to the next.This film pales in comparison to films like Saving Private Ryan and Platoon. An opportunity lost. I left the cinema modestly entertained yet empty and disappointed.",N/A
117,1917,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5318396/,"Last night COL Ferry and I (COL Coldwell, both USA) were able to watch the new WWI film, 1917, before it has national release. It is a cinematographic feast for the eyes, long expansive shots that follow the protagonists as they execute their mission. It does not hide the horrors that existed in trench warfare, it shows them for their brutality and abundance. (My great uncle died as a consequence of his service fighting in the trenches, mustard gas poisoning). In many ways it reminded me of Saving Private Ryan.For those who have served in combat (I have deployments to Iraq and Afghanistan), I cannot tell you if the film will be too difficult to watch, it might well be, especially if incoming artillery is a trigger. For me, as the camera travels a few inches above the dirt advancing slowly up a berm, my response was visceral. I was taken back to the patrols we walked in Afghanistan, not knowing what was around the corner; not relaxing heightened vigilance, not knowing if there would be an IED, a child wearing a suicide vest, a sniper taking aim. For the protagonists in this film (as for all who served and are serving) surviving the climb up the berm, there is no sigh of relief, no respite from the fear of uncertainty. They (we) survive to move forward to face more uncertainty.Watching allowed me to pay homage to my great uncle, and the approximate 800,000 other Brits who were killed or died as a consequence of their service. (Germany lost over 2 million soldiers in the war). Estimates put the total casualty numbers for both military and civilians at 40 million, half killed or died from wounds/infection.I rate this film as 10/10, for many reasons. Directing, acting, set design, cinematography, musical score, the raw emotion it invokes. Some critics have said they never felt a connection with the characters, I suspect they never served in combat. While the brotherhood (including female War Fighters) is strong, there is also a common characteristic possessed by all War Fighters, the ability to focus on a mission and suppress emotion, even as those around the Fighter fall. This was the quality I recognized in the actors and why the viewer doesn't ""bond"" with the main protagonists; we, the viewer, were on the mission with them, we grieve as we can and move on.Watch if you will, but know there is no pleasure in watching and the film will grab you and the beginning and not let you go. Even though we know the outcome of WWI, there is no joy, there is no peace. Watch because it will allow you a glimpse at the horror and brutality of war; reflect on their service and sacrifice. Note, as we (the viewer) are ""walking"" through the trenches, glancing shots of the young soldiers shows them with flat affect, isolation, almost apathy; this is the face of ""shell shock,"" what we know call post-traumatic stress disorder.For original WW1 footage, watch ""They Shall Never Grow Old,"" an exceptional documentary.",1917

Akash is shown to speak and understand Marathi well which means he has spent considerable time in Pune. Does he still not have a single friend?
2. Is the police officer so dumb that he gets into Tabu's house even as the neighbour Disa watches on? Which secret lover does that and that too someone who is a senior police officer?
3. A famous yesteryear actor has been murdered. The film runs for a period of at least a couple of weeks after the murder. Hasn't anyone seen the CCTV cameras to confirm if Pramod Sinha even left the building like Tabu claims?
4. Akash sees Tabu pushing neighbour Disa but the CCTV cameras in the lift, in which Akash is, can't catch this. Right?
5. Simi (Tabu) is effortlessly killing folks around her. But for some strange reason, she decides to leave Akash blind. Why doesn't she kill Akash?
6. The doctor has a hospital with just him and a nurse who makes a special appearance with the blood report. So, to help him remove Akash's kidneys, you have Murali and Mavshi acting as helpers. How ridiculous is that!
7. Murali and Mavshi fight out the police officer in the desolate building. But why isn't the doctor with them? He is not even in his hospital to keep a watch on Akash and Simi.Even Johnny Gaddar and Ek Haseena Thi had loose ends but not loopholes large enough for a piano to go through!

120,Andhadhun,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4526401/,"Many have reviewed Andhadhun and rated it highly and I am no different. I found it pretty damn entertaining myself. Following is just a review of the ending and how enriching that experience was for me as an audience. Hope you all like it.Watched Adhadhun again today. I never made a post about its ending the first time because I liked the Director's version of the open ending and leaving it up to the audience's interpretation.However, when I watched it again today, I realized that the film does not have any open ending if you carefully observe it.Before I go into the meaning of the ending we have to understand the phenomena of Rabbit or Duck illusion. Google ""Rabbit or duck"" for the image and the reference for rest of my review.For decades now, the Rabbit or Duck illusion has been presented as a test for level of creativity. What you notice in the image determines what part in your brain is more active. A lot of people look at Duck only, Some people see Rabbit only and some see both.Of course you can see both if you know that it's an illusion and you pay way too much attention to it and if you try to look for it.However, the real trick is (and this is the next level - not part of the original illusion but something that Raghavan has done here), that what if there is no illusion? But being used to the concept of illusion, we are forced to look for both Rabbit and the Duck.Andhadhun - There is no duck. It's only a rabbit.In the last scene of the movie, the waitress from the Restaurant comes outside and gives Ayushman his cane back. This Cane has a Rabbit at its handle (Raghavan starts his Rabbit/Duck illusion here)The movie begins with Ayushman's voice telling Radhika - ""bahut lambi kahaani hai....Coffee? - It's a very long story...Coffee?"" (This line is repeated towards the end and that's how the audience know, that Ayushman is telling the story of his life to Radhika)But interestingly, the story telling takes a pause right towards the climax (when Ayushman and Doctor in the story are driving off)...the scene cuts to London and Radhika says - ""Aur phir? (and then?)""This is sort of the writer's way of writing an Epilogue solely to ""create the illusion of creating an illusion"". In the Epilogue story, where Ayushman tells the story of Tabu's accident and how the rabbit jumped and caused the accident - there are only 2 souls that can know about the Rabbit. 1- Tabu (who was distracted) and 2- Rabbit (because it caused the distraction)...Even Ayushman won't know because he was blind. So very clearly, Raghavan tells you that Ayushman is simply bluffing in this final piece.Now some may say that the shooter also saw the rabbit and he could have come and told Ayushmaan (blah, blah) - but I am basing my explanation on what is shown. Not on, what is not shown and is pure conjecture.Here is one more thing - Tabu dying would have been a bigger piece of Info which Radhika would already be aware of since the case was such a high profile one, but she seems to get all this info first hand from Ayushman, completely oblivious of Tabu's whereabouts until that moment.So Raghavan very cleverly tells the truth, but by that time- we the audience are so trapped in this brilliant tale of our hearts wanting to continue in the suspense, that we want to believe there is an illusion for sure.Raghavan even more clearly tells it very loud and clear that there is no illusion- by having Ayushman's cane with a Rabbit(or duck) handle, clearly saying- that Ayushman is selling the illusion because he has no way of validating the presence of Rabbit but he is telling that in his story.It is absolutely a delightful way of gripping your audience by having them look for things that they invent as they go.Adhadhundh (the original word not the movie title - notice the spelling difference) - basically means, something that happens extremely fast and recklessly without any validation or thought - Exactly what the ending is.Fantastic!",Andhadhun

What Arab place are they talking about like everyone should know about it ? Never heard of it...Then you realize the Arab country they are going to is just an archetypal Arab country, non existent. A caricature of many seen-on-TV Arab countries... OK, why not, I suppose Americans (as people living on the American continent) have a lesser history burn with Arab countries than Frenchs, for example, do, and have no problem building a make-believe Arab country just for the sake of... what? At this point, I supposed the filmmakers wanted to make some point about Arab or religious wars... or terrorism... ? Since they are Canadians, not Unitedstatesians, I was hoping maybe for a not so obvious / good vs bad kind of story... But I was really wondering what was the purpose of all that.The story goes on, civil war, religious war, slaughter, all fake, all archetypal, OK, but to what end? What's the point?And then, you finally get the answer, at the end of the movie, with one unforeseen big plot twist.And then you realize the Arab story is absolutely irrelevant. The same plot could have been set in any archetypal place with a credible history of violence and torture... South America? Former Yugoslavia? Caucase? Heck, actually, since the prison/torture part is altogether sufficient to hold the whole movie, the very same movie could have been set just about Guatanamo (and viewers would then believe for one hour they were watching a anti-US movie, only to realize at the end the total irrelevance of all that)At the end of the movie, you get that astonishing plot twist, which makes you realize the vast vacuity and uselessness of all the side stories you have been watching for the past hour.

It is ironic that one of the best films about the Middle East conflict, and specifically the tragic civil war in Lebanon, should be made by a Canadian film maker. Incendies is based on a play but it feels as though it has been adapted from a great literary work. In fact there is no specific mention of any country in the film but no one can be in any doubt that the unnamed country is Lebanon.A Canadain-Lebanese woman dies in Canada and in her will she leaves two letters to her twin son & daughter. One is to be delivered to their brother (whom they did not know existed) and the other to their father (whom they had presumed dead). To find these people they have to travel to Lebanon to unravel the mysterious past of their deceased mother.

Besides, Mike Myers impersonation of a British general is more realistic and authentic than the guy doing Hitler, just picture that.What ruined it further, is that the only smart and powerful character, which nailed everyone in the movie, with his psychological and mind bending interrogations, ends up to be effortlessly tricked by the most mindless character in the movie.After watching the movie, I was sympathizing with Nazis, who were portrayed to have more bravery and humanity than our Basterds!!!

But QT exposes this hypocrisy by engineering a film where we are disgusted first by the excesses of the enemy and then by the excesses of our heroes. That is the first instance. The hypocrisy is slammed home in the second instance where we are first disgusted by the sight of American after American being shot dead by by a German sniper hero and secondly brought to revel in the butchery of several hundred enemy at the hands of our heroes. Tit for tat.It fits the pattern of praise for our heroes and cheers for killing the enemy, but because it is presented both ways the hypocrisy becomes self- evident.

133,Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0902240/,"How happy is the blameless vestal's lot! The world forgetting, by the world forgot. Eternal sunshine of the spotless mind! Each pray'r accepted, and each wish resign'd. -- Alexander Pope==> I confess to being an idealist and a romantic. This type of film appeals to people like me... the ones who believe in love at first sight, soul mates, destiny, yada yada yada. The Charlie Kaufman penned 'Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind' is as fresh and original as some of his other screenplays (Being John Malkovich, Human Nature, Adaptation), but adds a romantic depth that makes this one of the most complete film going experiences I have ever had.There was an exchange during the film between our two leads, Joel and Clementine, played with poignancy and nuance by Jim Carrey and Kate Winslet, that echoed what I was feeling about the film.Clementine: This is it Joel. It's going to be gone soon.Joel: I know.Clementine: What do we do?Joel: Enjoy it.Luckily for me, I knew I was going to be able to revisit the film many times in my life. The depth of the film manifests itself in the fact that the soul mates, Joel and Clem, both know that their time is running out and that they will never be able to meet again.Most films might choose to highlight this type of heartbreak with the death of a loved one or a bittersweet farewell at a train station. But not Charlie Kaufman. He is bored by clichés. Rather, he chooses to dazzle us with the complexities of the human mind and all of its glorious possibilities. He is a master storyteller that is unlike any other I am aware of.Joel (Carrey) is socially inept. He has had girlfriends, but none that really meant anything. It is as if he has never had a significant relationship of any kind. But, one day, he meets Clementine. ""Don't make any jokes about my name"", she warns him. She is wild and kooky, changing her hair color from red to orange to blue to green depending on her current mood. She seems the polar opposite of Joel, but they click. They click in ways even they can't pinpoint. But from the moment they meet, they know there is something special there.However, after a silly argument breaks up their relationship, Clementine decides to visit Lacuna Inc., a company that specializes in wiping troubling memories away forever. She has decided to erase the memory of Joel. When Joel hears this from some friends, he angrily decides to do the same to Clementine, erasing her completely from his mind.The erasing process involves a mapping of the memories and an all night process of erasure that is ""technically brain damage"", according to the doctor. The bulk of the film takes place during the process, inside Joel's mind. The most recent memories are first to go and we watch as they slowly disappear into nothingness. Those recent memories are bitter as we witness the arguments and the boredom of their relationship. But as the time rewinds, the memories get better. We travel backwards and watch Joel and Clem during their best moments, loving life and loving each other. As this happens, Joel desperately regrets his decision. He wants the inevitable erasure to stop, but he is completely powerless. Soon she will be gone and he won't even remember that he forgot her. The film focuses on his attempts to foil the process and retain some of her in the recesses of his mind.'Eternal Sunshine' is directed by Michel Gondry who also helmed 'Human Nature'. He has a flare that accompanies Kaufman's words with perfect symmetry. This film bounces around on its timeline almost hysterically, but the director never lets us get lost. We always feel in control of our senses and our emotions. It is a tribute to Carrey and Winslet that they were able to do the same.Jim Carrey has pulled off a rather remarkable transformation that I would have deemed impossible a decade ago. He is becoming a brilliant actor with qualities that resemble Jimmy Stewart and Tom Hanks. He is a fabulous everyman who is sympathetic and knowing, interesting and kind. He deserves tremendous praise for this role. Kate Winslet is consistently brilliant in every film. She is easily one of the very best actresses we have. Here she plays against type, and embodies a fascinating woman who craves attention but needs intimacy. Hers is a beautiful performance that will go overlooked. It is easy to understand why Joel falls in love with Clementine.I think fans of Charlie Kaufman will be thrilled with this brilliant entry in to his collection. I think the film will appeal to those who loved the recent masterpiece 'Lost in Translation' or Tom Tykwer's recent beauty, 'Heaven'. It is a romantic fantasy with real emotions and real characters that will resonate with the viewer who isn't entirely closed to sentiment. When Clementine whispers ""Meet me in Montauk"" into Joel's ear... it's hard to hold back a tear.This will easily be one of the best films of 2004. It is the antithesis of the typical romantic Hollywood fare. I loved every minute of its refreshing originality. The film has passion and flare and brilliant wit, all framed by an intelligent script that deals in absurdity while managing to maintain an intimate realism. These characters feel real. You root for them. You want them to meet again and give it another chance. It is a film that will only get better over time, as our memory of it waxes and wanes its way into our hearts.TC CANDLER",Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind

I do not know any French at all, but I sure wish I was fluent watching this movie!Compared to most other films ""Amelie"" (and I will stick to ""Amelie"" since ""Le Fabuleux destin d'Amélie Poulain"" is a bit long to write) is based on a rather ordinary and plain story everyone can relate to, but it is given to us in a very special kind of way, mixed with wonderful little subplots and an almost chaotic amount of details. We get to see and experience the world and especially Paris through the filtering eyes and fantasy of Amelie, A Paris that might feel small and limited on the screen but in fact is just as big as it is in the eyes of Amelie.Director Jean-Pierre Jeunet brings to life the world of Amelie with colors, masterful camerawork and a few special effects (Well, I have certainly felt like melting a couple of times too in my life!). Some people I spoke to before seeing ""Amelie"" criticized it for being too childish and unrealistic, but I believe it is an essential part of the movie since Amelie herself is a very childish and imaginative young girl. She just happens to fall in love one day when she decides to embark on a quest. Jean-Pierre Jeunet manages to bring us along without losing control of the set or the plot. It is exactly this kind of movie that could easily be overdone and lose all of its magic in the hands of the wrong person, but Jean-Pierre Jeunet never slips a single time. For you who think you never heard of him before he is actually the same man who brought us ""Alien 4"" back in 1997, (I still refuse to believe he was involved in that horrible film...), and the wonderful ""Delicatessen"" in 1991.Audrey Tautou could not be overemphasized for her importance in portraying Amelie. I am a bit embarrassed admitting it but I was almost falling in love with Amelie myself, forgetting she was only fiction on the screen. However she does not carry ""Amelie"" solely by herself. The cast makes an excellent whole and it is hard imagining switching anyone without affecting the whole outcome. Everyone manages to make the most out of their role and even though we only get to know some of them briefly they come alive just as much as Amelie herself does.I could go on forever about ""Amelie"". It contains so many details and switches in tempo and camerawork it has to be seen more than once to take in and understand everything. Damn it, ""Amelie"" made me happy, laughing out loud at times, and very few movies affects me like that.I very rarely give movies a 10, and I was indeed considering a 9 for a while, but for me this is one of those movies I will come back to time after time. Long after the CG thrills of hyped fantasy movies and big budget Hollywood productions have faded and been forgotten, Amelie will still be jumping around in my heart, doing all those silly and charming little things I wish I dared to do too...",Amelie
136,Snatch,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0662756/,"A film about boxing, diamonds, gangsters pretending to be Jews, a fat getaway driver, a rather vicious dog and man eating pigs. Guy Richie has followed the success of Lock, Stock with an equally stunning and ambitious return just as Tarantino did with Pulp Fiction. The characters are so colourful they jump right off the screen, the dialogue so snappy you want to learn it by heart and the acting simply wonderful. Vinnie Jones reveals he can act and Brad Pitt shows that he is far more than a pretty face and could well win a best supporting actor oscar for his role as Irish Mickey. See this movie!!!!",Snatch

138,Good Will Hunting,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0418096/,"Sure, this film's plot is fairly predictable. Sure, if you boiled it down to its essential components it wouldn't amount to much. Sure, Will Hunting's genius is profoundly unrealistic.Yet I'm giving this one 10 out of 10.I don't know whether Matt and Ben have ever been in therapy, but they certainly understand a lot about the human psyche, how it ducks responsibility, and pushes blame onto others, how it dismisses the real gifts it has and concentrates on running itself down. How many of us suffer from the same problems as Will? Only those who deny their own vulnerability will remain unaffected by this film.Not only is the script powerful, but the dynamics between the characters - all of them selfish, even Skylar - is vividly and plausibly executed. The film just about manages to avoid easy answers, preferring to acknowledge (indeed, highlight) the complexity and pain of personal growth and self-realisation.You could read a lot of self-help books, but they won't bring across to you as powerfully as this film what it's like to be scared, what it's like to experience loss, how difficult it is to shake off your old ways of thinking, how important honesty to yourself is. If this is the kind of revelation Matt and Ben are going to come up with, I look forward to their future efforts.The first time I saw it, I felt moved as the credits rolled. On my way home from the cinema, I felt sombre. When I got home, I finally burst into tears. This film burns slowly, inside you.As cinema, it's fair to middling. The performances are all first class. The script is a jewel. As wisdom, it's second to none. A fine achievement.",Good Will Hunting
139,Children of Heaven,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0410316/,"What a marvelous thing film can be. It can touch us and open our hearts to a culture that is both different and familiar to ours. CHILDREN OF HEAVEN, a film by Iranian filmmaker, Majid Majidi, takes us into the world of a little boy and his sister, letting us feel the love and trust that they have in each other. The boy, through no fault of his own, loses his little sister's newly repaired school shoes the day before she needs them. It becomes their secret. They try sharing a pair of his sneakers -- the girl wearing them in the morning and he in the afternoon to school. The wonderful, innocent faces of the beautiful Iranian children and their code of honor, even in poverty, provides the bases for a very uplifting tale of children trying to overcome a crisis. The direction, cinematography, music are all outstanding -- but it is the children that you will fall in love with. Well worth picking up on DVD (though there are no ""Extras"" to speak of).",CHILDREN OF HEAVEN
140,Children of Heaven,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0410311/,"Bacheha-Ye aseman (Children of Heaven)It was with some trepidation that I popped this DVD into the player - it was, after all, my first venture into Iranian cinema, so I was a little unsure what to expect. I am used to, and for the most part, enjoy foreign films. They open up an incredible world of cinema that one would otherwise miss. After five minutes, it was fairly evident that this film was something a bit special. The story is simple. While at market shopping, Ali loses his sisters school shoes. After desperately trying in vain to find them, he decides that he and his sister will share his sneakers, meeting her after to school each day to recover them from her, in order to get to school himself. That is pretty much a synopsis of the entire movie. It doesn't end there however...This film is played with such beauty and innocence; it is a true pleasure to watch. Mohammad Amir Naji plays Ali with such incredible depth and passion, one is completely drawn into his plight. From the start of the film, we see the relationship between brother and sister, played with equal warmth by Bahare Seddiqi, strained as he explains how he lost her shoes. The sorrow on Ali's face, and Zahra's tears at the news, are truly heartbreaking to watch. The expressions on the faces of the children are so genuine, it is clear that spending a cinematic hour and half will be a pleasure, albeit not an easy one.We see Ali and his Father looking for work as gardeners. From the outset it is clear that Ali's Father is strict, but it is also evident he loves his son dearly, and the simple exchange of smiles as they find their first job is heart-warming, and totally believable. Cycling through the city, it is very striking that there is a clear division between rich and poor. We are watching a boy, to afraid to tell his father of the loss of a pair of shoes, riding through streets with billboards advertising cell phones, into rural areas where houses with swimming pools, ornate architecture and luxury are rife.There is so much in Western civilisation that we take for granted. What to us are simple daily belongings to others is pure decadence. Aside from anything else, this film is a window into a world so many of us do not understand. Simple things bring Ali pleasure, blowing bubbles, swinging on swings with his new found friend, the smiles and laughter of the children is absorbing.Later in the film we see Ali enter a race in order to win a pair of brand new sneakers for his sister. To win them, he must come third. Again we see the division of wealth, as Ali races through the streets, the thoughts and images of his sister swirling in his head, and on screen, while at the same time, parents of other children film the race on camcorders, all the time Ali running, fighting for the shoes he needs so desperately.The film is directed perfectly, and the credit for this goes to Majid Majidi, whose films have won acclaim worldwide. There are no special effects, no luxurious settings. There are times when the film feels like a documentary in the direction, and that works in its favour.  This film would make an excellent introduction into the world of foreign cinema. Throughout the movie, the expressions and emotions displayed by the children speak far louder than any dialogue ever could.The film is not dialogue intensive, and one could easily watch the film, and understand the story, even without the aid of subtitles. This film was nominated for an Academy Award, and it not difficult to see why. Ignoring for a moment the subtitles and language barriers, since they are not overly crucial to the film, this is a story of true innocence, and tugs hard at the heartstrings, sometimes to breaking point. The portrayal of the children is gentle, warm and absolutely believable, and one cannot help but be drawn into this tale, as it gently unwinds. It is sometimes tough to watch the emotions played out, but ultimately, worth every second.Missing this film, particularly if simply put off by the fact it is foreign language, would a sad deprivation of the senses and the heart. It is not just a film, it is an experience, and one that is completely passionate, and totally unforgettable.I truly cannot recommend this highly enough. It is widely available on DVD or VHS - rent it, borrow it or buy it - you will be glad that you did!Reviewed by Ollie",Children of Heaven
141,Toy Story,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2159402/,"""I believe that a filmmaker's entire work is contained within his first film; not that it can all be foreseen, but that it can afterwards be verified."" – Francois Truffaut (The Films In My Life) Buzz Lightyear, a glossy action figure with a sexy sheen, is not a mere toy. He's a Space Ranger, tasked with protecting the universe from the evil Emperor Zurg! His life has meaning, he is unique, his existence has grand purpose! Woody, a dated cowboy doll, thinks otherwise. He was once a youthful and exuberant toy, the favourite plaything of his owner Andy, but years of existence have shown him the truth: everyone is just a toy, soon to be forgotten and discarded. No one is unique. There is no grand purpose. No universe to save. Better to be a realist, seeing the world without its fake plastic facade and tacky ipod veneer.Of course Buzz thinks Woody is just a crazy old timer. Doesn't Woody realise that Buzz is a genuine Space Ranger?! That he's a member of the Elite Universe Protection Unit! That he alone has information that reveals Emperor Zurg's weakness! That stupid fool! Naturally, we the audience identify with Woody. Buzz seems like an idiot, brainwashed and in desperate need of identity and purpose. The Elite Universe Protection Unit merely elevates believers into a position of exaggerated importance. This is an idle fantasy, an other-worldly hope adopted by those who can't face the dour reality that is the ""real world of toys"".Midway in the film, our heroes stumble across a horde of green alien toys. These aliens worship a giant claw, a mechanical God which they believe will descend and pluck the ""chosen ones"", taking them to some kind of toy heaven. In reality, the claw chooses only deluded souls, and offers them to the devilish Cid Phillips, a sadistic child who mutilates toys. ""Nirvana is coming!"" the aliens whisper, watching as the ""chosen ones"" are airlifted to their deaths.Buzz Lightyear faces a similar scenario later in the film. Having witnessed a television commercial which advertises a vast range of Buzz Lightyear action figures, Buzz must confront the fact that he really is ""just an ordinary toy"" who ""can not fly"". ""Flying"" thus becomes a sort of Nietzschean metaphor, the ability to transcend the ""flesh"" (in this case, injection moulded plastic) and become ""something more"".Buzz's first reaction upon seeing the commercial is to seek refuge in denial. ""I am not a toy!"" he says to himself, before climbing to the top of a staircase. Seeking to validate himself by flying, by defying the laws of toy-dom, he takes a giant jump – a literal leap of faith – and of course falls promptly to the ground. He can't fly.Cue the fastest existential crisis ever seen in a children's film, Buzz Lightyear promptly falling into a deep depression, his faith completely destroyed. His entire existence was based on a lie, a social framework which indoctrinated him into believing that the fate of the whole universe depended on his actions. How can he continue living? Why do anything? What's the point? And more importantly, how the hell did this become a kid's franchise? It's like a demented cartoon by Philip K. Dick (""Do Plastic Toys Dream of Suicide Switches?"").Then comes the message of the film. Woody tells Buzz that being a Space Ranger doesn't define who he is. His value, status and worth can only be found within the community of toys, on ground level, and not ""up in the skies"". There is no purpose beyond ground zero and our importance lies solely in our ability to bring good to those immediately around us.Buzz heeds Woody's words and quickly gets over his loss of faith. He stages a daring rescue mission, straps a rocket to his back and flies spectacularly in the air, his newfound love for the ""greater good of his family"" quite literally giving him wings.In true Zarathustran fashion, Buzz becomes a pint sized Ubermensch figure, a superman who reaches for the sky but is then brought depressingly back down to Earth. If he would just lower his sights, Woody then says, Buzz would find enough reasons to live. Set free of the ""moral code"" imprinted on him by his makers, Buzz thus adopts a new code which, though it puts limits upon him, negating some of his wild ambitions and reducing him, in an existential sense, to a chunk of plastic, still allows for a Nietzschean war cry. This cry, which Buzz yells every time he jumps across that dark abyss, sums up humanity best: ""To Infinity and Beyond!"" 8.9/10 – With its revolutionary visuals, consistent humour, genuine sense of adventure, memorable characters, slick camera work and a couple action/adventure scenes worthy of George Lucas, ""Toy Story"" is a milestone in cinema, and one of the most influential animated films since ""Snow White"".Most interesting, though, is in observing how Brad Bird reverses Lasseter's themes here with his first Pixar feature, ""The Incredibles"". Brad Bird seems to be the bad boy of Pixar, subverting them from within. Viva la Resistance. Worth multiple viewings.",Toy Story
142,Toy Story,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0984980/,"I am a big fan of the animated movies coming from the Pixar Studios. They are always looking for the newest technological possibilities to use in their movies, creating movies that are more than just worth a watch, even when they were made a decade ago.The movie is about toys that come to life when their owner is asleep or not in the same room. When the young boy's birthday is coming up, all the toys are nervous. They don't want to be ignored when the new one arrives. Woody the cowboy is their ""leader"" because he's the most popular one of them all. He's the only one that hasn't got to be afraid, but than a new favorite arrives ... Buzz Lightyear. He hates him and tries everything possible to get rid of him, but as the time passes by they learn to appreciate each other...When you see Toy Story, you may think that the different human like characters (Woody the cowboy for instance) aren't always as perfect as we are used to see in todays animated movies. Perhaps that's true, but if you keep in mind that all this was done in 1995, when computers weren't yet as strong and the technology for creating such movies was almost unknown, than you can only have a lot of respect for what the creators did.

Keep up the fight because, like the tide, those oppressive forces wont curtail.A rousing piece of cinema, you can forgive the historical inaccuracies in order for it to tell a hugely engaging and inspirational story full of hope, although it leaves you under no illusion of mans inhumanity to man and the vile and despicable things that can be done in the name of greed, power and control.",Braveheart
144,Reservoir Dogs,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6266102/,"As Tarantino as it gets. Reservoir Dogs is exactly what you'd expect from him. It's funny, it's gory, it's brutal and above all else, it's absolutely ridiculous. This movie could've been so incredible, but unfortunately, it slightly misses the mark.What I loved about this movie is, no doubt, what everyone else loved as well. Those scenes in the warehouse are spectacular. The fact that you can make conversations between people so intense and thrilling is remarkable. And this movie nails that. Every scene in the warehouse is perfect. You never know what is going to happen and you are constantly on the edge of your seat. Had this movie been entirely in the warehouse, I'm sure I would've liked it way more.As is though, the movie doesn't do that. It almost feels like Tarantino knew how intense those warehouse scenes were and decided that the viewer needed a break. As such, the film goes on to give introductions to some of the characters. These introductions, however, felt completely unnecessary to me. Not only did they break the pace and intensity of the film, but they also broke the mystery and intrigue of the characters. I would've been perfectly fine with never knowing anything but the made-up names that each character had. Especially the introduction of Mr. Orange felt unnecessarily long and added very little to the overall story.This movie could've been near perfect had it kept true to its intensity and the thrill of the post heist moments. Using that confined location and nothing else and pitting these characters against each other in an endless barrage of doubt and accusation would've truly been a sight to behold. I wanted to be on the edge of my seat the whole time, especially considering the relatively short runtime. Alas, I was forced to take breaks and breathe for a moment just be brought back into the excellence of the warehouse.With all that being said, it's still a great movie. It has all the characteristics you'd want from a Tarantino film and it is immensely entertaining even in the slower moments. It probably isn't a classic yet, but it undoubtedly will be one in the future. As far as I'm concerned, it wasn't as good as it could've been, but that's just my opinion. And based on most reviews that I've read many consider it to be as good as it could've ever been.",Reservoir Dogs
145,Reservoir Dogs,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3652935/,"Tarantino's brutal debut film. From the original initial dialogue, to the final outcome, the director astonishes everyone and makes clear his style: anthological dialogues (pay attention to the discussion in the distribution of colors that will identify each gangster, hilarious) a breakthrough structure, very good soundtrack (as in all his films), great doses of violence (although not at all gratuitous, but rather ironic) and, above all, a lot of black humor. In addition to superb performances by Harvey Keitel, Tim Roth, Michael Madsen, Steve Buscemi and Chris Penn. In short, a great example of good noir cinema (with all its ingredients: shootings, violence, betrayal, suspense, etc.), but with the innovative and very personal touch of the brilliant director, who would later continue to dazzle with the wonderful ""Pulp Fiction"".

This gave him the ideas which are now lynch pins of the entire series - an all powerful force, an evil empire, emperor, a purpose for our universe.This is the best of the series & not just because of the victory over the Empire. It springs a surprise in Luke having a sister, & completes Luke confronting what is left of his father. It destroys an empire & an emperor. It introduces Ewoks & then has them join in an alliance to create the victory. It even makes C3PO a God, & you can't top that.While it does not have a miracle create the complete victory, like Ben Hur does with Christs Crucifixation & events erasing Ben Hur's mother & sisters Leprocey, it does create a man made miracle alliance which ultimately destroys the evil Empire.

You identify with the despair, the youngsters' need to ""go home"", the loves left behind, the fear of dying, the dawning enormity of their action as they recede from the survivors in the sea, the sheer fatigue of continuing when every nerve yearns to be free of the boat's confines - the pressures of war, and marvel at the courageous human will that keeps defying all odds and surviving.I found myself on edge for the entire movie, feeling as trapped inside the sub as the crew and even cheering as the boat surfaced in the end against all odds and then, mourning the futility of it all. The movie succeeds in showing the war as a very human tragedy, forcing us to not hide behind anonymous ""enemy"" tags. Among many tragic moments, especially poignant is the scene where the captain recants the incident of watching the survivors cry for help. You can almost see his eyes glistening. Almost.The cast is superb but the captain is outstanding, his eyes brilliantly essaying his emotions.Best version is the director's cut in the original German with English subtitles.What I don't understand is why Das Boot never won any Oscars.

We love to watch every submarine movie ever made, from ""Run Silent, Run Deep"" and ""Destination: Tokyo"" to ""The Hunt For Red October"", ""Crimson Tide"" and ""U-571"". Why? Because we can always use a good laugh. For those in the know, submarine movies are usually absolutely hilarious. Except this one. After being in the Navy for four years, serving with around 350 different men, and being acquainted with a further 200-300, all of them submarine sailors, I think that I can state with absolute certainty that this film is the ONLY submarine movie that ALL submariners take seriously.

Some 23 years later, the existential plight of Travis Bickle, ""God's lonely man,"" continues to pack a hard emotional punch. In fact, it's hard to know where to begin when praising the elements of this film - such elements as the dark location shots of a (now gone) seedy Times Square, the cinema verite settings of the cabbies and campaign workers, the magnificent Bernard Hermann score, Paul Schrader's fine script, the memorable performances of Jodie Foster, Harvey Keitel, and Peter Boyle all must be mentioned. However, the brilliance of this film is primarily a result of the brilliance of De Niro and Scorsese, one of the greatest actor-director teams in movie history. This is an unforgettable film and rates a 10 out of 10, in my estimation.",Taxi Driver
152,Taxi Driver,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0150412/,"A towering classic of American cinematic power.  Martin Scorsese teams up with one of the most intense actors of that time to create a masterpiece of urban alienation.  Paul Schrader's magnificent script paints a portrait of loneliness in the largest city of the world.  Travis never once enters into a meaningful relationship with any character anywhere in the film.  He is the most hopelessly alone person I've ever encountered on film.He is alone with his thoughts, and his thoughts are dark ones.  The film fools you on a first viewing.  Is Travis an endearing eccentric?  Sure, he's odd, but he's so polite, and he's got a quirky sense of humor.  His affection for Betsy is actually rather endearing.  But on a second view, you see it for what it is.  The audience comes to see Travis's psychosis gradually, but there's actually far less development than one might think. When he talks about cleaning up the city, the repeat viewer knows he doesn't mean some sort of Giuliani-facelift.  This is less a film about a character in development as it is a kind of snapshot.  To be sure, it takes the stimulus to provoke the response, but does that imply some kind of central change in the character?Tremendous supporting roles are brought to life through vivid performances by Keitel and Foster especially.  Shepard's character, Betsy, is little more than a foil to highlight Travis's utter alienation from society, but she is still impeccably portrayed.  With only two scenes that don't center on Travis, it is unavoidably De Niro's show.  The life with which the supporting cast imbues their characters is a credit to themselves, and to the director's willingness to let the film develop from the intersection of diverse ideas and approaches.  What would the plot lose by eliminating the Albert Brooks character (Tom)?  Nothing at all.  He makes almost no impact on Travis's life, which is where the plot lives.  But his inclusion makes the film as a whole much richer and fuller.As a piece of American cinema history, this film will live forever.  But far more important than that, this film will survive as a universal, ever-relevant examination of the workings of the alienated mind.  The story doesn't end when the credits roll.  We know Travis will snap again.  But the story doesn't end with Travis either.  It continues today in the cities and in the schools.  The film is about the brutal power of the disaffected mind.This film didn't cause the incidents in Colombine, or Hawaii, or Seattle, or wherever you care to look, even with all of its disturbing images of violence.  It didn't cause those things.  It predicted them.",Taxi Driver
153,The Sting,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0988676/,"The fix is in, the odds are set, and the boys are ready to play for the big time, both on the screen and behind the camera in this breezy, endlessly entertaining movie classic.Robert Redford is small-time hustler Johnny Hooker, happy to play the marks in Joliet until the murder of his mentor pushes him to go up against the nastiest mug in Chicago, Doyle Lonnegan (Robert Shaw.) Hooker'd rather ice Lonnegan outright, but will settle for a big con with the help of a slightly wobbly but game scammer named Henry Gondorff, played as only Paul Newman can.Newman and Redford, along with director George Roy Hill, had a lot riding on this pony, given it was a follow-up to their earlier ""Butch Cassidy And The Sundance Kid."" To measure up, they had to produce nothing short of another classic. And so they did. ""The Sting"" won the Best Picture Oscar in 1973, and remains the sentimental favorite among many in choosing between the two films.Comparing ""The Sting"" to ""Butch Cassidy"" is kind of overdone sport, and tempers, as Lonnegan would say, run hot. But you can see why ""The Sting"" worked as well as it did by looking at how the director and the stars played it differently within the same basic framework as ""Butch Cassidy."" Newman and Redford are again outlaws and underdogs. Period detail abounds here as it did with ""Butch Cassidy,"" and there's another memorable score amid the proceedings, Scott Joplin rags modernized by Marvin Hamlisch. The score even produced another hit, ""The Entertainer,"" to compare with ""Raindrops Keep Falling On My Head.""What's different about ""The Sting,"" and what makes it such a classic in its own right, is the way the stars service the plot. In ""Butch Cassidy,"" Newman and Redford's comradeship was the story. Here, the chemistry between the two actors is minimized in favor of spinning a yarn with enough red herrings to feed the Swedish navy. The tale here is better than ""Butch Cassidy,"" which is a more elegiac film with grander cinematography and funnier set pieces. ""The Sting"" is an edge-of-your-seat caper flick from beginning to end.You can't really call ""The Sting"" a comedy. Though there are many laughs, especially when Newman hooks Shaw during a poker game, Hill won't let the audience relax enough for that. What this is is a con game, played on the audience, designed not to cheat but entertain by means of clever hoodwinking and constant misdirection plays.You'll get no spoilers from me. This is one worth sitting through with no expectations. Five gets you ten you'll enjoy Newman and Redford, and a terrific supporting cast (one advantage over ""Butch Cassidy"") that includes Charles Durning, Eileen Brennan, Dana Elcar, Harold Gould, and Mr. Hand himself, Ray Walston. There's another familiar face from ""Butch Cassidy,"" Charles Dierkop, Flat Nose Curry in ""Butch Cassidy"" and Lonnegan's right hand here. The best performance may be Robert Shaw's; he exudes menace aplenty but some humanity, too, when he takes Hooker under his wing after learning he came from the same hard streets of Five Points Lonnegan sprang from.Terrific period detail, too. The dialogue is great and feels real in its Runyonesque way, while the cons are elaborate and logically played out. Watching this a second time is especially fun because once you know how the plot goes down, you find yourself catching clues you missed the first time, and enjoying the film even more for them.Why didn't Newman and Redford team up again? Certainly there was another good movie for them to partner up in, but as Gondorff would have put it, only chumps don't quit when they're ahead.",The Sting

155,A Clockwork Orange,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0115514/,"It's hard to judge a film such as this. Its cold and hard, yet can be exhilarating and sarcastic. It can be average, yet it can be visionary. Exploitive? Satirical? Too many questions to consider when one watches this film.Even after 34 years, this film still speaks volumes about our current culture, which many ideals are ringing true today. The younger generations are out of control due to lack of parental control, junk culture is becoming commonplace, violence is desensitizing the masses, and we all seem to be enjoying the ride on the way down. It's very difficult to find movies which can make such startling commentary, yet hold on to such accusations for an extended period of time. Nowadays, films are focused-grouped to death, conformity is more powerful than artistry, and money is far more important than quality. Kubrick took a huge leap with this film, challenging society to take a hard look at itself. Unfortunately, society wasn't ready for this film, which is why it is revered now more than ever.",N/A
156,2001: A Space Odyssey,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0100789/,"There are two schools of thought about 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY.  One, is that it is the greatest science-fiction epic ever made. This is supported by those who claim to understand the complexities involved and leading up the Star Child ending. The others, like myself, find it as absorbing as watching paint dry on woodwork.The musical background is glorious, the colors are dazzling, and there's an interesting use of HAL as a villainous computer. Beyond that, there is nothing the least bit interesting about the human characters (trite dialogue and no personality or warmth to any of the individuals), the pace is unbelievably slow (so the intellectually gifted can philosophize on the mysteries of space), and the payoff at the end leaves you either breathless with enlightenment or convinced that you have watched three hours of nothingness.I had the same letdown feeling when I watched THE CLOCKWORK ORANGE, so your like or dislike of this movie is purely dependent on personal taste. Intellectuals will take the position that you are a mentally challenged clod if you dare disagree with their elevated opinion of the movie--so be aware that this is not conventional story-telling in any sense whatsoever and only for those who admire Stanley Kubrick's way with unlikely cinematic material.",2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY
157,Lawrence of Arabia,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0077794/,"A man has an inner drive that makes him peculiar and intense. He goes to the desert and falls in love with it and its people. Gaining powerful sponsors, he has a grand vision that he accomplishes by inspiring and directing thousands. But in a very short time, that grand work is compromised and disassembled by fat cats in offices who are concerned with different values.True of both Lawrence and Lean. The legacy of Lawrence is still in violent disarray (I write this a short time after the Sept 11 attacks on New York). But Lean's vision was saved, and what a vision! Of this picture, it can be said that it is perfect if only because it is so visionary that it defines its own rules.Lean's vision is also lean, with vast zones of sonic and visual silence -- several meditations on the unperceived. Though there is a story (who are you?) this is really a film of TE's 'Seven Pillars,' which creates a romantic vision of sculpted natural forces. So powerful a depiction that Islam experienced a faddish attraction in the West, a place now enjoyed by Tibetan Buddhism. That was before.See here the original Obiwan, every intonation, movement and dress. See here Peter O'Toole's personality become completely entwined with the character, who is as fictionalized by our eye as by Lowell's. See the most expressive, anthropomorphic train wreck in history.Watch a particularly interesting brand of acting by the 'Arabs.' Macho men are acting anyway, so an actor can play an actor when he lands such a role.The star of the film is the clever eye of God, not the clockmaker or judge of the west but the chess player of the mirage. Its face is clearest in my mind when the Turk holds TE down for torture and smiles. Its hand in the creaking of Feisal's tent -- who would ever imagine the wind acting? (Kurosawa's 'Ran' at the beginning is the only other example I know.)I have a few films I admire for various. mostly intellectual qualities. But in the direct matter of visual storytelling, this one tops my list.",Lawrence of Arabia
158,Lawrence of Arabia,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4233399/,"Did you know that Cary Grant had been approached to play it? Yes, as well as Albert Finney and that made a lot more sense but it was Albert Finney who said, have you considered Peter O'Toole? Who? - Yes, I love that story. It goes to prove that certain things are meant to happen. I'm sorry if I'm going on about it. But I saw Lawrence Of Arabia for the nth time in a 70mm print in a crowded theater and what came across as the one major reason this film will be relevant forever is Peter O'Toole. His performance is timeless because it is unique. Cinematic and theatrical but always true. David Lean brilliantly created a sense of intimacy in O'Toole's eyes within the vast, arid landscape. I know the film has its detractors. I heard once director Michael Apted call it a ""silly movie"" Wow, I had Michael Apted's quote in my mind when I saw the film last and for the life of me, I don't know what he meant. I love this film.",Lawrence of Arabia
159,The Apartment,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0070306/,"One of the finest examples of smart, satiric comedy-drama ever created for the screen. Jack Lemmon (in amazing comic form) plays a working stiff in Corporate America--via New York City--whose bachelor apartment inadvertently becomes a love-nest for amorous, married executives. The film is extremely modern for 1960 and features a non-stop barrage of funny, clever talk. Lemmon is a mad genius at frenzied (yet sympathetic) characterization, and ""The Apartment"" catches him at his professional peak in the movies. Working alongside huggable neurotic Shirley MacLaine (also at her peak) and shady Fred MacMurray (parlaying his slimeball role with curt persuasion), Lemmon creates a new kind of acting: screwball realism. **** from ****",The Apartment
160,North by Northwest,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0068454/,"With everything you expect from Hitchcock and more, ""North By Northwest"" is terrific entertainment from the master.  There are interesting characters, an exciting story with intrigue and suspense, lots of fine photography, and some of Hitchcock's best-known set pieces.  It's capped off by a fine Bernard Herrmann score that is almost as good as the one he wrote later for ""Psycho"".Cary Grant may be the ideal Hitchcock actor, and he is a big part of making this such great fun.  As one of the man-on-the-run characters that Hitchcock loved to make movies about, Grant is entertaining and believable, maintaining good humor even as he tries to work his way out of a series of desperate situations.  The other stars, James Mason and Eva Marie Saint, also are very good, and the supporting roles are all filled by good character actors.The story is one of Hitchcock's most exciting.  It's slightly longer than usual, and it occasionally stretches credibility, but it all goes by quickly because there is always something interesting going on, and there is also plenty to look at.  Whether using the famous landmarks or using more everyday settings, there is always lots of good detail, and the settings complement the story nicely.  At times the plot becomes somewhat fanciful, but probably deliberately so, for it only emphasizes Hitchcock's mastery of technique that he can have his characters do almost anything and make you believe it at the time.With everything that characterizes Hitchcock at his very best, this fully deserves its reputation as one of the finest films by him or any other director.  You can watch it several times and still find it just as entertaining.",North By Northwest
161,North by Northwest,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1058631/,"VERTIGO did nothing to advance Hitchcock's career in 1957 when he released it, and it's actually not a shame: the following year he decided to go completely against the slow-moving erotic thriller genre and do something shamelessly commercial, escapist and single-handedly create the spy movie. Ian Fleming, author of the James Bond novels, states he based his character on the physical characteristics and the suave personality of Cary Grant, as an added note. This could well amount to be the first James Bond film -- a dangerous villain complete with a sidekick, an alluring woman with a dubious nature and an enigmatic ""boss,"" a dashing hero, lush locales setting the scene for powerful chases and escalating danger.NORTH BY NORTHWEST has one crucial difference to any James Bond film, though: Alfred Hitchcock. While the Bond films have been seen as quintessential action fluff (although fluff of the better kind until the franchise ran out of gas in the 80s), Hitchcock, always the master of subtext as well as suspense, creates memorable scenes that balance sexual tension, sexual innuendo, comedy, and mounting suspense seamlessly. There is never the feeling of being bored as there is too much going on, especially with the sizzling chemistry of Eva Marie Saint and Cary Grant, by now a Hitchcock veteran. When they're on screen, dialog crackles and so much more is said with so little gesture -- she closes the lid on her Ice Goddess role, but gives it a nice, cheeky, knowing wink. He of course evolves from the sort of man who while looking and being slightly clumsy and under his mother's thumb -- once it becomes clear he's been marked and is a target for a sinister plot that only later becomes clear -- becomes more assertive in taking matters into his own hands. A quintessential Hitchcock Everyman, Grant has his stamp all over his role. No one can imagine anyone else running away from that crop duster in one of the movies many standout sequences, or saying the reassuring last words to Eva Marie Saint as they cuddle together in the train. When one thinks of NORTH BY NORTHWEST, one thinks Cary Grant.Easily one of Hitchcock's best films, made while he was at the peak of his career in the bracket formed with THE MAN WHO KNEW TOO MUCH and MARNIE. Great supporting performances are all over the map, from Jesse Royce Landis as Grant's mother, James Mason as Phillip Vandamm, Martin Landau as Vandamm's protégée who might be a little more than that, and Leo G Carroll as The Professor. Doreen Lang appears early in the movie as Grant's secretary; she would of course be remembered as the woman who shrieks at Tippi Hedren in THE BIRDS and gets slapped by her as the camera holds itself tight on her face.",North by Northwest
162,Vertigo,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1007137/,"Since there are already so many real good comments on this film I want to focus on only one aspect.Vertigo is a great example for what color films really can look like! Not only do I want to praise the quality of the Technicolor dye transfer prints but also more the way Hitchcock used color to create moods. Many directors used light to create moods in black and white movies but only very few ever got so far as to use the much greater palette of colors for the same purpose. One wonders why. Some directors decide for an overall color look, which is often done in the lab, but not on the set.Vertigo is full of scenes where the colors have been saturated or changed to create a special feeling. Hitchcock even went so far as to openly dye some frames is bright unnatural colors. He played around with colors in all his color films but never as much as in this one. Think for example on James Stewart's nightmare in the middle of the film. There are frames dyed purple and green; the cemetery scenes are red, inserted to the rhythm of the music with normal frames. Kim Novak is often bathed in colored light like in the famous hotel room scene, where she appears like a ghost with all the green light around her.The shading is also important. In the scene in the bookshop we hear a dark and sad story while at the same time the light dimes down to simulate dusk. In the scene where Judy remembers the real events in the bell tower it starts with an outdoor scene, which we have already seen but it is now much darker than the first time. In the sequence where Stewart follows Novak to the cemetery everything feels unnatural since every scene glows through the use of a filter that creates a blur. The non-color of Kim Novak's dress as Madeleine is also a very important aspect in the film. She has to color her hair to become Madeleine again at the end of the picture.The way color is used in this film gives it this dreamlike quality that allows endless interpretations. A true masterpiece!",Vertigo

The tap routine with Gene Kelly and Donald O'Connor is so energizing that I wanted to see it again and again. The fantasy number with Gene Kelly and Cyd Charisse is breathtaking, breathtaking! How extraordinary to see Debiee Reynolds going through the contagious (Good morning!Good morning!) I had seen her a few nights before as Grace's mother in ""Will and Grace"" She hasn't lost her zest.

164,Ikiru,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0047047/,"I think that Ikiru is one of Akira Kurosawa's most personal films. This shows in the identification the viewer has with the main character of the movie. Every development in Watanabe's life is like a experience in the own viewers life. I have never been so touched and at the same time been amazed by a film.I just can't see why so many people have trouble appreciating this movie. Maybe because they aren't used to black and white pictures these days.Ikiru is a movie that can't be missed, so be sure to see it. 10/10",Ikiru
165,Ikiru,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0047035/,"Ikiru (""to live"")is a Kurosawa film devoid of samurai or Toshiro Mifune. It is an oddity in his canon, neither an adaptation, nor an epic, or even a detective story. Instead, it is the simple and touching story of the last months of the life of a man, Watanabbe, public official, who decides to give a meaning to his life by transcending the obtuse and stiff mind of government bureaucracy to get a small public children's park built. As a parable for the soulless workings of modern bureaucracy, the goal is set pretty high, and Kurosawa goes even further, giving this story a lot of character, frequent humor, life and, most of all, heart. And going beyond the strengths of the direction and script, is the central performance by Takashi Shimura (later Kambei in Seven Samurai). Shimura gives his character such a transparently good heart and such great pain that every second of Watanabe's plight and struggle tugs at your heart, not in an overwhelmingly sentimental manner, but in one than feels honest and pure. If even many hardened souls will be drawn to tears, it is not for pity, but, admirably, because of envy for Watanabe's beautiful human dignity in the end, and for a film to have such power is beyond pure accomplishment, as the need to see this and, more importantly, feel it, goes beyond pure necessity...",Ikiru
166,Bicycle Thieves,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0038372/,"Possible Spoilers One of the simplest movies ever made, yet one of the most poignant. Of particular note is the title of the film, which serves, in retrospect, to illustrate deSicca's main point. In English, the singular title ""The Bicylce Thief"" causes the viewer to question who really is the bicycle thief in the movie? It is logical to conclude that the title refers to the main character, whom the film closely chronicles. But to call the hopeless, dejected character, with whom the viewer has empathized for the entire movie, a thief would be ludicrous, unless- by calling such a man a ""thief""- deSicca is making a more powerful commentary on an inability to define a person or his actions as absolutely good or absolutely evil- the two terms are not mutually exclusive, as there is a blurring between the two that occurs when other factors are considered. The title serves as a reminder that not all criminals are evil- some have been motivated out of good intentions and desperation. In the end, the viewer is forced to make a jarring comparison between the ""thief"" who stole the main char's bicycle and the main char, himself. The irony of the situation causes the viewer to realize his own hypocrisy. Though we formerly considered the first thief to be petty and evil for ruining the main char's life, we can no longer hold such a judgment of him after witnessing the main char do the same- an act which the viewer considers sympathetically. The change in judgment toward the first ""thief"" which the viewer is forced to make at the film's conclusion is a reminder to the viewer that one's awareness of the circumstances governing a situation can dramatically change one's assessment of the situation. The Italian, plural title ""Ladri di Biciclette"" serves to generalize the crime, desperation, degradation, to everyman in post-war Italy. I also loved this movie for the portrayed father-son relationship. The little boy did an excellent job in portraying a boy who attempts to act like a grown up in order to help, and therefore gain the approval of, his father.However, by the end of the movie we are reminded that the boy is just a boy (which the father seems to forget at intervals, but realizes when he offers to take him for pizza, etc.). The father also has a dilemma- and not just that he bears the burden of providing for his family monetarily, but that he must provide moral teaching and an example as well. Moreover, the filial relationship serves to better illustrate the theme of blurred definitions of good and evil. The boy's black-and-white ideas on good and evil is juxtaposed with the reality of post-war Italy, in which there can not be such a clear distinction between the two terms-""good"" people are forced to do ""bad"" acts in order to survive. The two different moral characterizations are forced to converge in the young boy, himself, when he witnesses his own father commit a crime. The boy is forced to grow up too soon- i.e., to abandon his absolute views on good and evil in favor of the grey reality in order to grant his father forgiveness. The ending of the film illustrates that though a child may constantly seek approval and confirmation from his father, the approval which a father must seek from his son, though far more subtle and less obvious, plays an equally important and intrinsic role in filial relationships.",The Bicycle Thief
167,Bicycle Thieves,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0038374/,"It is post-war Rome and much of the city's residents are impoverished and desperate for work.  One man named Ricci who haunts the job lines day after day to provide for his wife and two children, when suddenly his name is called for a well-paying city job.  The only catch is that he needs a bicycle for the job, and he has just pawned his bicycle in order to feed his family.  Thus begins `The Bicycle Thief', Vittorio de Sica's gritty study in realism.  Ricci and his wife sell the sheets off of their beds to get the bicycle back, only to have the bicycle stolen on his first day on the job. In order to keep the job, he and his young son walk around Rome, desperate to find the thief, and more importantly, the bicycle before his next day of work.  de Sica chose non-actors to portray the characters in the film, favoring a further realistic vision by casting amateurs.  The result is remarkable, because the pain and emotions conveyed are so true.  The relationship between father and son is also compelling and endearing, in that for the most part, Ricci treats his son as an equal, letting him in on his innermost thoughts and fears, until the end, when a particular event causes him to be ashamed, and the roles become defined once again.  `The Bicycle Thief' personifies the refreshing fact that European cinema was more daring and also true in their reaction to post-war life.  While America was trying to paint a heavy coat of rosy paint on the times by churning out the saccharine MGM musicals by the dozen, Europe was showing that the effects of a war fought on their home turf did not inspire moments of spontaneously breaking into song, or a choreographed dance number, rather life pretty much sucked, but survival, as difficult and ugly as it can be, is most important.  `The Bicycle Thief' has been a critical favorite for decades, and for good reason.  It is a must-see film for any cinephile.--Shelly",The Bicycle Thief
168,Double Indemnity,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0030230/,"This film is great fun. Sxity years later, it's as taut and engaging and beautiful as any contemporary story.It simmers, it sizzles, the tension between Neff and Dietrichson is positively palpable. But, as the tension between Neff and Dietrichson fizzles, the tension between Neff and Keyes heats up.It's as pure a sample of classic film noir as there is, and it does it with unparalleled style.This is what movie-making is all about. It's not a labrynth of characters and trick endings and gimmicks. In fact, the movie starts with our tragic hero admitting he's the who whodunit...what are we left with?The story of how and why he dunit, of how he was intoxicated and bewitched, yet came to his senses, not soon enough to save him legally, but at least to come to terms with his own failure.",N/A
169,M,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1323508/,"In my opinion this is just an OK film. Except for some little stylistic tricks there is nothing special. The story is OK, how it is told is rather weak, in some parts it's even ridiculous, the acting is mostly very weak except for Lorre who you don't see much of anyway, and the sound quality is horrible (something you can't blame it for, but I had to use HEADPHONES on full volume to even understand the words!) but switching from sound to silent all the time is very distracting and has no dramatic effect at all (even if some say so) - the opposite is the case, it seems very amateurish. The slow pacing is typical for it's time. And suspense? I don't think so. In my opinion the main reasons why this film is so critically acclaimed are:A) Lorre's overacting. Whenever overacting has a purpose it's critically acclaimed. And his acting as a madman is very effective. B) I'd call it ""heavy look"". The topic seems ""heavy"" and the plot and style seem all too heavy and important. You almost want the film to be successful so you search for it in Lorre's acting. As a justification so to say. I'm sure you like the film for many other reasons too. Some more important reasons maybe. But that doesn't mean I'm wrong. It's a film we want to like and where you don't want to look for the flaws. Well, long story short, I don't think the final result is a success. There is too much Average in it and the Great isn't all that great. Metropolis, Nosferatu, Caligari, Sunrise, I think, have all a more stunning look. All silent and all made before ""M"". Don't get me wrong, the cinematography is good and also inventive in little parts, but not THAT revolutionary that it deserves the reputation it has. Probably the flaws are too big for me to fully appreciate the rest. Like every time one said: ""He doesn't leave any marks...blah, blah"" I had to laugh. He talks with the kids in the middle of the day in the middle of the street, he walks along the streets with them, he goes into shops, buys stuff for them, he makes mad gestures in public. And then he also whistles this damn song all the time so loud you hear it from three streets away while everyone in the audience knows from beginning on that this will be his doom. 6/10",N/A
170,Metropolis,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0004376/,"I doubt that I'd ever seen anything resembling a ""complete"" version of METROPOLIS before, though certain of its scenes were familiar to me, if only as used and abused in such films as Diane Keaton's HEAVEN (1987).  In any case, whatever I had seen before had nothing like the clarity and beauty of the Kino restoration.  I expected to be distracted by the restoration's technique of concise written descriptions of missing sequences, but the narrative coherence that these provided was definitely worth it.  As ""exaggerated"" as the style of acting seems by contemporary standards, some performances, such as the Master of the city, are amazingly nuanced and layered, and Brigitte Helm is stunning as both Maria and her evil clone. The meticulous design of the film, the unerring camera placement and Lang's muscular choreography of the crowd scenes are breathtaking.

171,The Kid,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2201789/,"The Kid became a critically hailed international hit. A tramp (Charles Chaplin) brings up an abandoned baby (Jackie Coogan), and later loses him to his mother (Edna Purviance); but there is a happy ending.The film is a sentimental silent comedy set in the slums. The comedy is sparingly laid on, but the overall effect is much less painful than the synopsis would suggest. The production is comparatively smooth, young Coogan is sensational, and the film contains much of the quintessential Chaplin. Chaplin had difficulties getting The Kid produced. His inspiration, it is suggested was the death of his own first son, Norman Spencer Chaplin a few days after birth in 1919.",The Kid
172,The Kid,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1611019/,"I've always thought there's a great beauty and poignancy to the best slapstick comedies, even unsentimental ones like Keaton's ""The General"" or Laurel and Hardy's ""Way Out West."" The latter comedy has a scene where L&H perform a soft-shoe dance; it always brings me to tears. Why? Maybe physical comedy has the same kind of effect on me as a dance performance. Both art forms are very expressive; the fact that I'm laughing doesn't dilute the emotional charge.One of many things that made Chaplin a genius was his understanding of how close slapstick is to pathos already. Why not marry the two things? That's what he did in some of his early short films, and that's what he does in this feature comedy. The Little Tramp finds an abandoned baby and raises him into boyhood. But the authorities find out and want to take little Jackie (Jackie Coogan) away. Meanwhile, the mother who abandoned him has since become a wealthy singer and doesn't know if she'll ever find out what became of him.Jackie Coogan (about five in this film), with his charming manners, his talents as a mimic and his adeptness at physical comedy, is one of the all-time great child actors. Want more evidence of Chaplin's genius? Coogan doesn't steal the film from him. This is true even though Chaplin, as producer, star and director, makes every evident attempt to spotlight the boy's talents. Coogan is even better here than he is in his own vehicles, like ""My Boy"" and ""Oliver Twist.""Chaplin's storytelling—even with the foolish sub-Dickensian plot twists, such as Jackie suddenly taking ill—deftly draws out the comedy and pathos for maximum effect. The individual scenes themselves are flawlessly constructed. The window-breaking scene, the flophouse scene, the dream sequence, the trying-to-get-rid-of-the-baby scene—they're perfect. Chaplin's celebrated pantomimic skills are examples of storytelling in themselves.Want me to criticize something? How about those thudding attempts to link the mother with Jesus? But you know, I can't even complain about that. It's too sweetly naïve. And the movie as a whole is too good to allow us to sneer at the (very) few flaws.One important note: children love this movie. Show it to them while they're young, and you'll make Chaplin fans of them. And that's better than their becoming fans of almost anything that's being peddled to them.",The Kid

I'm not saying that they shouldn't have become friends because you can't rewrite history and this movie was based on a true story.

Based on true story of piano virtuoso, Don Shirley's road trip through the south during the 60's, the film pays tribute to his genius and courage as a black man who tries hard to soar above the ugliness of the times. The elegant trappings of his home and his success as a concert pianist leave him arrogantly cold and lonely, but his life begins to change when he hires Tony as his road trip driver. With a history as nightclub bouncer with Mafia connections in New York, Tony is the antithesis of Don's perfection and their evolving relationship on the road makes the movie soar above the ordinary and become magical. Viggo and Ali in the main roles are remarkable, and it's funny and endearing to watch them discard stereotypes and discover their mutual humanity. What we liked best is the
movie teaches without preaching, it all unfolds through a myriad of natural moments between two great actors and a strong supporting cast.

180,"Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri",https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4191210/,"The drama of Martin McDon, known primarily for his ability to violate the foundations of modern drama, can easily be considered one of the best in the outgoing year.In the center of the picture is the mother of the deceased girl, seeking justice and justice in a rather cynical manner and the unquenchable hope for which is the meaning of life, along with a single son and a worn blue overall.""Where is the cliche?"" - I thought, and already on the 10th minute of the movie I stopped speculating about the development of events and trying to predict the replicas and actions of the characters. This unpredictable plot was not in my memory for a long time, considering that all the events taking place for nearly two hours (and there were an unlimited number of them) surprise with their surprise and sometimes absurdity.The non-linear structure of the film makes the viewer systematically ask the question, ""What will be the end?"", But ""What will happen tomorrow?"". The same question is asked to themselves and all the characters: the divorced mother Mildred, who is already desperate to find justice, ultimately lives by today and actually loses the intelligible for herself and for the surrounding purpose, humiliating the policeman and accusing them of racism, sexism and other "" "". Sheriff Willoughby, who learned that he has cancer, does not know what will happen to his reputation after his death. The sheriff's widow does not know what will happen to her daughters. The assistant to the sheriff Dixon sits up his pants and reads comics, having no motivation, no prospects, nothing.The appearance of three billboards in Ebbinge literally leads this small town into a rage. The hunt for Mildred is accompanied by violence on the screen, both from her side and from her ill-wishers (scenes in the dentist's office, as well as in the advertising firm). Even the church involved in the scandal gets gets on the forehead of Martin McDonagh, who calls her ""a criminal group"" and ""lovers of little boys, and in general, boys."" The whole town shows all the dirt, like a fish, rotten from head to tail, stinks of hypocrisy.Thus, the unyielding willpower of the heroine Francis McDormand and her motivation, which at some point is questioned, makes the actress, perhaps, the main nominee for the Academy Award. And the abundance of all sorts of characters (including the hero of Sam Rockwell), well-designed, but sometimes fantastic scenario and satire on acute social problems (racism, sexual harassment, police lawlessness, etc.) make the Three Billboard reflect modern disgusting reality and valuable ( if not the most expensive) coin along with Bruges and the Seven Psychopaths in the treasury of the talented Martin McDonagh.Bravo, McDonagh!","Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri"

Krishna rather drinks after murder and goes to Aarushis room again to slit her throat .. 7. Parents never seek revenge or justice or look for any reason or evidence for death of their only daughter8. Hemraj is allowed to entertain guests after 12 midnight and also he is allowed to steal liquor from owner !9. 5 doors open and close at least 2 times ..

I wanted to wait for critic's response to the film, but somehow decided to attend the preview. Meghna Gulzar's direction is gripping and thrilling. I am watching her work for the first time and will surely be eager to watch her future works. The film's narration is perfect and grasping, which result in an edge of the seat story. The background music is soothing and Gulzar made sure to give best for his daughter. There is not a single dull or bad moment in the film. Talking about the stellar cast in the movie, I have to say 'mind blowing'. Irrfan Khan does it again. He leads the charge like a boss. It's so much fun to watch him on screen. He is serious, funny, humorous, sarcastic, unapologetic, rude..everything he plays with an ease. I don't know the names of many actors, even though I know them by face, everyone did a fantastic job. It was great to watch a movie like Talvar on Gandhi Jayanti. The faults in the system, the non-interested investigating officers and the society..are properly represented in the movie.

183,Baahubali 2: The Conclusion,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3704832/,"Honestly, I do not understand the hype about this movie. This was one of the worst movies ever made and a horrid collosial waste of money and time. I wish I could get my money back. It does not take large copious amounts of money and VFX to make a good movie, but rather, the script, editing, direction and acting should be it's strong points. This movie falls flat in all of these.The director treats his entire movie audience as fools by bending the laws of physics as per his whims and fancies and putting in elaborate nonsensical, visualizations and stunts, as and when he desires. It probably, would all have made sense, if the Bahubalis and their army, were mutants or part of the Avengers team. Otherwise, it's only laughable. Some folks, told me to appreciate, ""the effort with which the movie was made and it's grand visuals"". Well, you just cannot appreciate the effort put into this movie, for despite all it's lavishness, it's a bad movie with a clichéd plot line; Which is a shame, as it had potential to be so much more.",N/A

185,Drishyam,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3516989/,"With all honesty, the Hindi version of DRISHYAM gives me no energy to write about it in details being the weakest 4th remake of the original Malayalam film featuring Mohan Lal in the lead. Using a fresh backdrop and a local feel it has got its impressive moments that obviously come in the final hour when the proceedings become high paced, intense and brutal too with police interrogation crossing all its extreme limits at the orders of its own IG. But at the same time, it doesn't make any change in its slow first half, following the fixed format that was also pointed out as the weaker portions of the original by few critics. Still, despite the not so happening first hour, one might like it as a crime thriller that doesn't allow the viewers to move in its concluding hour, offering many unexpected twists and turns keeping them thoroughly engrossed. However it's the missing emotions, lack of energy or fire, average performances, a loud-inconsistent background score, avoidable spoon- feeding and few unnecessary (ridiculous) commercial insertions that don't let you rate the film more than anything above average or decent. Thankfully they use only two songs out of four (in the soundtrack) as required but fail to en-cash on the emotional aspect of the script that should ideally have been its key feature becoming a 'family- thriller'.As a bitter truth, the theme of the film didn't require any kind of philosophical soundtrack both Vishal and Gulzar are known for. The weak acts of Shriya Saran, kids and more contribute a lot in its feeble impact. Plus confirming my doubts Ajay Devgn remains a miscast in the role of a clever minded, cinema loving father guarding his small family. Moreover the most disappointing feature remains Tabu, who doesn't come up with anything even close to what was being expected quite surprisingly, whereas Kamlesh Sawant as the cruel sub- inspector scores the most.In comparative terms, it seems DRISHAYM (Hindi) has been made hurriedly in some kind of available time with the star or team, without giving any major emphasis on solid characterizations as seen in the original. In clear words, where in all the four regional films, the actors seem like sinking deep into their given characters, the Hindi version has them all doing it as another of their professional assignment standing in front of the camera with no home-work done of any sort to play their given roles. Mentioning it specifically I didn't find any concerning FATHER in Ajay Devgn or a MOTHER in either Shriya or Tabu disappointingly, that was supposed to be the main requirement of the script as my personal conclusion. So would suggest to go for the original Malayalam film first if you wish to enjoy the subject more in the right manner. Note: Hope after DRISHYAM many passionate Hindi filmgoers get enlightened that in reality our Indian Regional movies and makers are miles ahead than the present mainstream Hindi Cinema in all respects.",DRISHYAM (Hindi)

So, definitely the expectations would be high at least by the people who have seen it.The movie is super entertaining and comes off as a new genre. The first half gives you a beautiful picture about the characters, how they are simple, funny, trying to meet ends and commoner. Just before the interval you get a glimpse of the story and how it is going to screw everything up.Second half is just an intellectual battle between Tabu and Ajay. How they try to out do one another. The climax is brilliant.Ajay makes up for the time he was away from serious movies and excels scene by scene, Shriya is gorgeous and does well too.

Many smaller nations, like Estonians, did not choose sides, they just tried to survive and carry on, splendidly expressed through tangerines in the film, but remote weaponry reaches everywhere and does not ask questions (Estonians were not considered hostile by both sides). All this is nicely presented in this Estonian-Georgian film, where Estonian actors used are all famous film actors (the Georgian ones were unfamiliar to me, but they were convincing), and characters seem very realistic. As far as I know, the topic of honour and keeping word are holy among the Caucasus nations, enabling to depict scenes and events odd and even improbable among the Western, ""civilized"" nations. The venue is limited to the remains of a village, but as everything is so properly constructed and performed, you do not feel embattled, and can follow and emphasize with all characters, significantly widening the audience and letting ponder on and over the essence of warfare.

189,Tangerines,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3077220/,"This film is flawless and one of the highlights of the Montreal World Film Festival 2014. It also was recognized with many international prizes in Europe, North America and even Israel. It captures the incoherence and inhumanity of war from the point of view of innocent civilians and of dehumanized soldiers. The pace and plot are crisp, compact and conscious-elevating with a spectacular, yet simple screenplay. The cinematography and music match and enhance the emotional and philosophical human drama. The acting from the all-male cast is poignant and powerful in its restraint. Zaza Urushadze's text comes to life like a play in this sometimes claustrophobic confine which only heightens the inherent tension between the protagonists. The directing does however balance this with the sad beauty of rural Abkhazia conflict zone. The simple sets set the mood and this movie is shooting for the moon.Alexander Kuranov returns as the editor after teaming up with Zaza Urushadze for the excellent multiple story Three Houses (2008) and gets every cut and emotion right. The dialogue, like the film, is raw, unpredictable, mysterious and profound. It brings you the very core of humanity's hopes and fears. The theme of pointless war has rarely been portrayed so perfectly. It surpasses even seminal South Korean The Front Line (2011) and does so in a intellectual and emotionally effective way. Beyond that it is a human drama about people stuck in a conflict and how they decide to deal with it and each other. Is there a glimpse of hope or some guidelines we can learn from?Be sure that I will be looking for Zaza's previous and next work. This is cinema at it's best.",N/A

The story is about one man but he is not the only one who plays the role exceedingly well. After watching this I don't think any one who acted in this film was remotely bad. They all acted amazingly well and gave true justice to their own characters. Only drawback that i can mention here is the time. i think the movie is a bit too long.

194,Udaan,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2284105/,"Udaan First time director Vikramaditya Motwane has done a brilliant job with Udaan. This film was truly worthy of a screening at Cannes. The simplicity of this movie is probably what makes this movie wonderful. Its a story which is not too uncommon in India, but the way its been shown, is what brings the freshness in the film.Rohan(Rajat Barmecha) has just been rusticated from his boarding school along with his 3 friends for they were caught watching an adult film of sorts(Kanti Shah ke Angoor) by their dean. As it turns out, Rohan has to go back to his home in the small industrial town of Jamshedpur, To add to his woes we find out that he hasn't met his father(Ronit Roy as Bhairav) in 8 years and he doesn't even know of the existence of a step-brother(Aayan Boradia as Arjun) at his home. Reaching there he learns that he has to work with his father at his factory and enroll in engineering college. And the disciplinarian his father is, he can't even question him. As he is stuck there with his dream of becoming a writer seemingly getting shattered, he learns to cope with life. He learns to love his kid step-brother, manages to write between work and college, sneaks out for a drink or two at night, but inspite of all this, he is getting suffocated. He wants to escape. He wants to fly.Udaan is a simple, emotional story about a boy in a small town, learning to live with his disciplinarian of a father. It is actually as simple as that. It might not sound interesting like this but the fact is that the way this normal coming of age story has been showed is just brilliant. There is nothing 'bollywood' about this film, its as if this movie was shot with a handy-cam, capturing the lives of a real family. But that doesn't make this one bit boring, because obviously there are some exaggerations, some gags, some drama but all in all its very real and believable. I'm sure everyone one of us would be able to relate to this film in some way or the other.The high point of the movie is the performances by the leading men(there are hardly any women in this film). Ronit Roy as a single father has done his job with perfection. He drinks, smokes, but still goes for a jog every morning, which also turns out to be a very important aspect in the story. He sometimes loses his cool, uses force in teaching his kids a lesson, but at times we also see that he is caring and probably a little vulnerable. He's acted so well, that you can feel it when he is drunk, you even get scared when he is angry, that good is his screen presence. I was wrong to write off this TV actor. Rajat Barmecha too has done an impeccable job in portraying a kid, who has lived his life in one of the best boarding schools of India and now is stuck in a small town. He does the usual, sneaks out at night for drinks and smoke, steals his fathers cars for doing so, but still makes it on time in the morning for his daily run with his dad. His writings are beautiful too, so credit must go to the original writer as well. But the award must go to Aayan Boradia who is one of the best child actors I have ever come across in Indian cinema. He is so real, so cute and you will just fall in love with him. He is somewhat aware of what is going on but obviously at his age he just can;t do anything about it as his understanding does not go that deep. And then lastly Ram Kapoor as Jimmy, Bhairav's younger brother brings a very good contrast between his authoritarian brother and his practical chilled out of sorts character. He understands Rohan's dreams and aspirations but he can only do so much to convince his big brother to change his mind. A very intriguing relationship between the two brothers I must say.Running time of over 2 hours, this might at times seem a little slow, but you gradually understand the importance of those long silent shots as the film progresses to its climax. There are scenes that will send chills down your spine. There scenes that will inspire you to 'fly out of a cage' if you are in one, metaphorically speaking of course. Its just filled with those moments that will be with you for sometime to come. It won't be easy to forget this movie soon. And let me assure you, you will come out highly satisfied after watching this movie. A big thumbs up for Motwane! Looking forward for more! Cheers to all the actors as well!",Udaan
195,Paan Singh Tomar,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2575184/,"I shall attempt to write a review about the movie. But I must confess that vocabulary needs to be reinvented for writing a review about such a movie. The word Brilliant, Cult will be an understatement.The story rips apart the callousness of our mediocre society and bares the ugly trust of being a sportsman in India.Paan Singh Tomar was a national record breaking sprinter who became a rebel. He had an illustrious career as a sportsman in the Army but the chores of his village life forced him to retire early to tend to his fields. The serene life of village proved to be more challenging than the task of defending his motherland. His own cousin brother who had now become a local muscle-man with the help of police took over Paan Singh's field without any remorse. Paan Singh tried every possible way to make our legal system attend to his woes but to no avail. Finally he resorted to his own personal strength to bring justice to the wrong doers. The story begins with a writer (Brijendra Kala) going for an interview with the Subedar (Irrfan Khan). Brijendra Kala has acted to perfection; it cannot get better than this! Most of the story is in flashback but it keeps you clutched to your seat. Story telling had never been better than this. Paan Singh aka Subedar, a rank which he got in the Army narrates his illustrious career as an athlete in the Army. However the career of a national sports hero does not translate into a successful place in the society as he struggles to keep his farm safe from his own cousin. Tomar who has been taught that Army men are guardians of the country believes that laws and system would protect his farm & family. His belief is shattered when the cops refuse to acknowledge his complaint even after his son is beaten to a pulp by the hands of his cousin. Later when his cousin attacks Tomar's house and kills his beloved mother Tomar sets on another race only this one will be in real life with guns, goons and cops. A quote from the movie, Paan Singh Tomar says – 'In a race there are rules, rules which state that once you have started the race it doesn't matter if you are ahead of behind or how much time it takes you have to reach the finish line'.A must watch for all the sports lovers.",Paan Singh Tomar

Though the language is thick Chamabl dialect but Irrfan bridges that gap with a masterful display forcing you to laugh, cry and feel his pain. Tigmanshu Dhulia is among the rare breed of bollywood directors along with Anurag Kashyap who have the knack of picking up great scripts and turning them out into movies which have the right mix of real acting and appeal to please both the masses and multiplex audience.

197,The Secret in Their Eyes,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2114041/,"""El Secreto de sus Ojos"" hit me with unspeakable strength. I didn't expect to like it so much, so I owe a review to those in analysis measures before seeing it or those interested in some opinion.First off, Campanella works with flawless effort all of the technical aspects of the film. It even starts with a double exposure effect, mixed with some sad shots of a beautiful Buenos Aires that hints the spectacle ahead of us. One shot especially, from a chopper in a soccer field edited with a crane shot is breathtaking. Nothing to envy from Hollywood upper class.But the main strength of the movie comes from the powerful narrative dominion Director Campanella has over characters, spaces and silences. Many moments are coldly tense, scary and very, very intense. This crossover from genres by Campanella couldn't have been better. Crime stories often fall in common places, this one relies on the fragile psychological state of the audience to draw all of it's intense dialog, acting and scenes.I cannot stop recommending it, Argentina can open it's market with movies such as this. It has many, many memorable moments, it interwines comedy perfectly and it is doubtful you will instantly forget it, as it is so well constructed. See it if you can!",El Secreto de sus Ojos
198,The Secret in Their Eyes,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2132292/,"This is quite frankly an astonishing film. One that fills your entire array of senses and sensitivities, and the praise from Argentine reviewers here is 100 percent justified. Ricardo Darín turns in another majestic performance as a Buenos Aires court employee who is fiercely affected by the rape and murder of a young girl in 1974, a tragedy that dominates his life. Overlapping this theme is the powerfully sensual but never physical relationship between Darín and his superior, the investigating judge played by the superb Soledad Villamil. The connection between the two is electric. It's a pity this film cannot easily transcend the language barrier, if it was an English-language film of the same quality it would already be hailed as a masterpiece. The blending of tragedy, love, violence and humour is brilliant, and the comedy dialogue fantastic. One scene where Ricardo Darín is balled out for having searched an old lady's house is priceless in terms of comic timing and delivery. A wonderful performance also from Guillermo Francella as the court clerk with a drinking problem, in fact the secondary acting is all first-class. The camera-work is impressive, especially the swoop down into the football stadium and the closeups, and the script is also superb. Argentina has nominated the film as its candidate for best foreign film at the Oscar's, it deserves to walk it.",N/A
199,Warrior,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2481021/,"My girlfriend took me to an advance screening of Warrior because I'm an MMA enthusiast. She told me she did not expect much. She ended up leaving the theater in tears.The fighting in the movie is almost an after thought. What the movie is really about is a broken family trying to get on with their lives. You have a recently sober father trying to earn the forgiveness of his sons for destroying his family years earlier, one son trying to provide for his wife and children, and the other son trying to earn money for the family of his friend and fellow Marine who died overseas. All of it comes together seamlessly and provides for a truly gripping movie.It's emotional without being sappy. It's funny without being goofy. It's inspirational without going over the top. It's hard to say anything bad about it. Even if you have no interest in martial arts, you will get something out of this movie.I highly recommend this movie for men AND women, fight fans and average Joes alike.",Warrior
200,Warrior,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2601795/,"Please don't read this if you don't want the ending given away.I've noticed a lot of people complaining that the ending spoils the film and is clichéd because the underdog and not the better fighter wins.I'm not suggesting that my interpretation is the right one but my view is somewhat different than the one some people hold. It is perfectly logical to point out that Brendan had hard fights to get to the final and that he would probably have been exhausted and that Tommy has had a much easier route.However, the point is that he made that route easier because of his rage. Tommy is only the more destructive force because of that. His demons are driving him on because he is lost. He cannot or will not reach out to connect with his father or brother. The point is that the dam is broken when he sees his father in the hotel room raging against Ahab. This is deeply symbolic. I think you are meant to draw the connection with Ahab who was driven by his own rage with the rage of the father which destroyed his family to the rage which Tommy now feels. Even though he is drunk it is no coincidence that his father refers to Tommy as Ahab and bellows at him to stop the ship. At the point that Tommy takes him in his arms and holds him he begins the healing process but loses what makes him such a formidable fighter. Thus he is simply unable to blow his brother away in the way that he has done to every other opponent.The other crucial point (and you would have to be a younger brother to fully get this one) is that Tommy doesn't really want to beat his brother at that point. He needs to know that his brother loves him and perhaps that he regrets not reaching out to him when they were younger. The fact that he taps out only at the point when Brendan says he loves him is significant as is the fact that he breaks down in the corner before the final round. Had he still been carrying his rage he would surely rather have been rendered unconscious than submit.In other words, for me it was the perfect ending and the more you think about the film the more profound it seems.All in my view of course. Which could be a load of old rubbish.",Warrior
201,Shutter Island,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3813630/,"Shutter Island is the story of Teddy Daniels, A U.S. federal marshal sent to the island with his partner Chuck Aule to search for the disappearance of a patient. Each scene provides a turn against their leads and compels them to look for more whilst searching in places we couldn't comprehend, including their minds. Leonardo DiCaprio and Mark Ruffalo feed off each other and supply great performances for their characters as expected, but some of the other characters whose names are riveted on the posters or marquees are sensational as well. The two that stuck out to me most were Ben Kingsley (Dr. Cawley) and Michelle Williams (Dolores, Teddy's wife), each of whom brought so much dramatics and new questions to the movie, developing plot twists and controversy. I don't think this film would be the same without them.This is also a film I would recommend seeing a second time. In fact, it is even better the second time. All those pieces of that puzzle you didn't catch the first time, you will the second. You see, we as the audience are first put in the shoes of Teddy. The second? Well, without giving too much away, lets just say you are put in someones else's shoes entirely during the second viewing.Shutter Island. A film that will make you question your own sanity. A film that will leave you breathless. A film that has re-ignited the thriller genre. A film that will leave you, and the main character, searching for answers.",Shutter Island
202,Up,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2127557/,"LOOOVED this movie.I found it so enjoyable to watch and actually had tears in my eyes from a particular scene which included a Doberman (won't say more). I also teared up from an emotional, tender scene with Carl and Ellie.The animation breathtaking, extremely funny and quirky too. It didn't pander to children i.e a kiddy movie, but made sure it entertained 'kids' of all ages.I actually wondered if the writers of this movie got together one night for pizza and beers and penned out this movie whilst a little intoxicated. It's got some seriously good laughs!Can't wait for it to come out on DVD.I highly recommend this movie.",N/A
203,Up,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5485117/,"This film is possibly one of the best animated films of all time as it tells an emotional moving story while being funny. As I said the emotion in this film is full of heart and even though I didn't cry it will make most people cry. The characters in this are perfect even if it is a small character like Ellie or big character like Carl everybody gets so much development even Charles Muntz the villain of the film is also given development, even more than some superhero films nowadays. Also this film has comedy some Pixar films now just want to make you cry but in the 2000s they had mix of sad and funny moments. So overall this film is as close to perfect as an animated film can get, it is has a mix of emotions it is funny and sad when it needs to be it has so much heart and the characters are perfect. This film in my opinion is the best Pixar film.",Up

Here he is stripped from all the gloss and sheen and most of the unnecessary melodrama and the final result is surprisingly entertaining! The story is really simple and there are not really very many surprises in the plot but you really don't care. ShahRukh shows again how much he can entertain given a chance and the director gives him the space to do so. The girls who make up the team he is coaching are really delightful and the time spent developing their stories was time well spent. The director could have eased of a little bit on patriotism where it was not directly relevant, but it doesn't really mar the whole experience.Overall a fun experience!

This movie is about a man trying to prove his dedication and love for his sport, his people, and his country. This is about a man scorned by the nation, shunned by his close ones, and his redemption in the way he knows best. Its this main underlying theme that makes CDI special. This theme is so universal, and so identifiable, that your heart connects instantly.CDI is about Indian sportswomen coming to the forefront, about the stark and grim realities staring at our national sport, and the reasons behind that. It is about unity in diversity, strength in weakness, and putting the team above oneself. Its about the sacrifices one has to make in order to achieve his goals. Its about the success of true sporting spirit! Its real, yet entertaining. Its patriotic without being jingoistic. Its international, yet soaked in Indianness. Its a collage of the different states of India, and the difficult but fruitful formation of this collage.I have never played or watched or been interested in hockey! But this movie does not need that to touch your heart. All it needs is some patriotism, humility and goodness in your heart. If thats in abundance, I am sure you will love it.As for the performances, I would just say the entire team rocks. the keyword here is TEAM, as thats what this film is all about! Enjoy !",Chak De!

207,There Will Be Blood,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1787835/,"There Will Be Blood is a story about greed, religion and vengeance due to the discovery of one of nature's riches: OIL!Daniel Plainview(Daniel Day-Lewis) is a poor silver miner who is injured and taken in by a few men digging for oil. When one of them dies in a freak accident, Daniel brings up the man's son as his own and becomes a self-made oil tycoon in the process. After receiving a tip-off that a seemingly impoverished town out west has a whole ocean of oil beneath the surface, Plainview rushes there and stops at nothing to get what he wants. Even if it means losing all the things most important to him, especially his SANITY. It was written for the screen and directed by Paul Thomas Anderson, who also directed Boogie Nights and Punch-Drunk Love. This is definitely a far better than the two. He should get a Best Director Nod for his work. The music is unlike anything ever I've ever heard, and it completely drew me into the haunting mood of the movie. The movie will get a lot of Oscar Nominations, hopefully Best Picture but most importantly:Best Actor. Daniel Day-Lewis is arguably the most talented living actor and his performance here clinches that title in my opinion. At first, you see how Plainview goes from being an extremely charismatic individual to a dark, insane and vicious oilman. Day-Lewis perfects all of these characteristics to a T and no other performance this year is even in the same league as this one. The movie is about 2 hours and 40 minutes long but it certainly didn't feel like it when I watched it. Actually, I would've been happier if the movie was 3 1/2 hours. It was that good. I was simply enthralled by this work of art. It is the best movie of the year with the best performance of the year.",There Will Be Blood
208,There Will Be Blood,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1840254/,"People did not like this movie for a simple reason: too negative. I can understand that this movie is so depressing in so may ways. What it shows that Big Fish eats Litte Fish and none of us want to think about that anymore than most of us experience it in our daily life. It shows the battle between the evangelicals and the corporate business man. Or maybe even the battle between evangelicals of today and the non-religious people or atheists of today. Even worse is that this movie shows that religious people, priests are or can be as bad as a corrupt oil man. Maybe why people did not like this movie is because it might have offended them. Especially Paul Dano playing the priest. Both Daniel Day Lewis and Paul Dano are wrong and too extreme on their opinions. People are able to accept this. What people cannot accept is though that these same extremities and same misguided opinions from both characters are very much true in that they are heavily believed still today. Not all Christains are like Paul Dano's character and not all business man are like Daniel Day Lewis's character but many are like them. That is the world we live in.Now is their any alternative or positive side? The answer is yes and that is H.W. the son of Daniel Plainview(Daniel Day Lewis). He epitomizes hope. He shows that despite being deaf and having a father who uses him as a ploy for better business he can still break free of the chains that he is being tied down by. What separates H.W. from the residents and evangelists of Little Boston? The difference is that he and his father are educated and they are not. That is how Daniel Plainview is able to manipulate and cheat them the Sunday family, even Eli Sunday(Paul Dano) the priest and preacher of Little Boston. From what H.W. sees and experiences he sees that much of what is around him is just wrong. He uses his experience that he had gained as a kid to break free of the corruption and chaos that could have taken over him. That is one aspect of the education I'am talking about: our experiences and understanding of what is happening around us. Now to get to the technical aspects of There Will Be Blood. It is just truly spectacular in every way. First off the acting was amazing. Daniel Day Lewis gave arguably the best performance of his career playing Daniel Plaiview or ever since movies began to be made. He freaked me out and probably shocked many people. His thirst for power and money was at such a high level that it made me wonder about what people are really capable of. The deceiving, the greed, the thirst for power and the every man for himself attitude actually looked more real than ever to me. Without Daniel Day Lewis I don't think this movie could have achieved what it has. Paul Dano gave a great performance as Eli Sunday though people tend to disagree. I think he gave a great portrayal of an extremist evangelical priest of how he himself had his own thirst for power and how he was more blasphemous then respectful and gracious to god then how you would expect a priest to be. How could people not be shocked by these two characters, I was myself.Why was the music for this movie not liked. I thought this was among the top five musical scores I have ever heard. The music perfectly gave you the feeling of the corruption and deception setting into the movie. It perfectly intertwined with the rest of the movie as the movie itself was ever growingly becoming more and more chaotic and surreal. Probably too shocking though.Paul Thomas Anderson I believe gave the best directing job of the year. He was able to show the oil fields and its processes, the rise of an oil man, the way everyone can be bought even a priest and the hope that H.W. represented. This movie was never boring and it was as stunning of a directing job as Daniel Day Lewis gave as a performance for his role in this movie. The intensity of this movie was as high as a movie could possibly be and some of the credit for this has to go to the director. The cinematography and the music seemed to intertwine perfectly like the rest of the movie. It gave the sense of the time period and as said before the greed, deception, etc. The cinematography did not just give you a negative feeling but a feeling as if what you are watching is real.You should not like this movie just because of the great technical achievements as you should not for any movie but for what it says and how it says it. I'm not even sure if you should enjoy this movie in general but you should not be blinded by your opinions. I applaud you whoever out there who can somewhat understand this movie and get past the lying and deceiving we do to ourselves. This movie really shows the humanity of human beings. Why is this rated-R?It has so many intense scenes that if you get inside this movie it is truly haunting. Now maybe this movie was too powerful for many people, it was probably even shocking for realists. Maybe though its not that surprising that so many people don't like this movie because the truth hurts. Not the truth about corruption or about people but the truth about ourselves.",There Will Be Blood
209,Pan's Labyrinth,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1592863/,"I went into this movie with no expectations, except that I'd see a Spanish-language, adult-oriented fantasy film with English subtitles. I think unmet expectations can hurt people in two ways: either the film disappoints them and they are overly critical as a result, or they are disappointed but too biased to admit it. I think the latter has led to an exceedingly generous rating for this particular film. Is it good? Yes. Is it the 65th best (according to current IMDb ratings) movie of all time? Not even close.It is an interesting, original story. Virtually every actor appearing in the film is superb. The imagery is magnificent. Like I said, it is a good picture. However, I am puzzled as to why it is praised so highly. I would have a greater appreciation for the film if its adult-oriented nature was due to its substance, such as an intellectual, sophisticated and enigmatic storyline. It is adult-oriented, however, merely because of a few choice phrases and displays of graphic violence. This is not a film that is breaking new ground. It is too simplistic throughout, becomes fairly predictable, and lacks fluidity. The unimaginative way in which the fantasy elements come and go was a real put off. The 65th best movie of all time should have the fantastic elements blended seamlessly with the human elements. It should continue being original throughout. It should challenge the viewer in new and engaging ways. It should not merely curse, show some blood, and have pretty imagery.Please, see this movie and enjoy it. I truly did. I also, however, allowed myself to make a realistic assessment afterward. I expect that the rating will come down as the novelty of an adult-oriented fantasy picture wears off. Maybe I missed something, but I doubt a specious film like this can conceal such intricacies.",N/A

The new characters in the movie feel like they were in the previous two films, they were that engaging and really worked well in the movie. The best part of the movie has to be the ending, I almost cried and was moved to just about to tears. I truly believe that this is one of the best Trilogies of all time.

212,Rang De Basanti,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1275334/,"The movie released today after a lot of hype and controversies. I went to see it expecting it to be a little different from the standard escapist fantasies churned out by the Indian film industry (of which I am not a fan). What I got was something so very different from what I had envisioned. The humor,the clichés, the nonchalance of youth, the culture, religion,politics... are all there and the best part is that it works. The storyline though is stretched a bit (we Indians need that) but the message is loud and clear. Throughout the movie a great sense of humor is maintained.The performances are all excellent. I have given this movie a rating of 10 solely on the basis of the originality of the story. While this movie is definitely not Kurasawa or Satyajit Ray, it is one of the few movies from India which I feel will appeal to both the mainstream and discerning audiences. A movie not to be missed.",N/A
213,Black,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1018281/,"I fail to see any mastery in the narrative of the most celebrated film of this year. Black. (loosely inspired from the 1962 film ""The Miracle Worker"" based on Helen Keller's life.) Debraj (Bacchan), the stereotypically cranky genius teacher of Michelle (Mukherjee), a girl born deaf and blind, was supposed to enter a magician - I would have loved to see a Robin Williams there - of Dead Poets' Society, of Patch Adams, of Goodwill Hunting, of the Hook or for that matter a Johny Depp of Finding Neverland or Philippe Noiret of Cinema Paradiso - a magician, a creative genius, a compassionate, enlightened and colourful wizard. What I got instead was a brainless brute for a pedagogically wrong teacher, a monster who incessantly shouts on through the first half of the film at a child he knows can't even hear. The scenes with most potential are the ones treated with most preempted melodrama and least substance. The sequence where Debraj finally gets to training his student for twenty days, for example. Here, director Bhansali, largely considered a master of mis-en-scene, succumbs to hiding the lack of research and screenplay material behind a touch and go montage, squeezing the whole story of Michelle's training (loosely based on Anne Sullivan's struggle to teach communication to the blind and deaf Helen Keller), which is later going to develop into the second plot point of the film. Michelle's world remains relatively unexplored throughout the film, but for melodramatic purposes. There are infinite references to the title in the dialogue, but we never understand how is Black different to green or scarlet or turquoise to a completely deaf and blind girl when she is not even aware of the existence of other colours to make a comparative statement like that. There wasn't a single reference to her training in colour references or rhythm recognition, again something that gets hidden under Ravi Chandran's immaculate chiaroscuro. Each frame of Chandran's could be printed as a work of art, but his cinematography was largely incoherent with the narrative. I'd flatter it to say that for me, it reached Conrad Hall levels, but failed to show me either Michelle's or Debraj's world, and stayed confused between the two, like the narrative, itself. Art director Omung Kumar successfully creates an Eastern Europe in North India, but leads Chandran in incoherency with the story. Robert Frost's 'Stopping By Woods On A Snowy Evening' has been used on the walls of a sign linguist's house, where one expects to see a dictionary of homespun signs and words inscribed on the walls. McNally's Anglo-Indian house looks like a museum, where Shernaz Patel gives a tiresome performance as a postcard. The Hindi dialogue of the film belongs to a story like Devdas and the English dialogue belongs in a Class 5 Balbharati textbook. The semi-final blow comes when director Bhansali rips off a scene from his own film Khamoshee. The emotionally pulsating climax of Khamoshee where Nana's character gives a thank you speech in sign language becomes a tearjerker pre-climax in Black, with Rani swapping places with Nana, and Shernaz with Manisha. The climax again is brilliant, you are just about to say, ""good, at least caught one out of the many juggled balls"", when comes the final blow - the dénouement. A yet another mumbled painting. Now some great scenes quickly - the first hospital scene where Bacchan is walking in one direction and Rani in the other; the ""enlightenment"" scene where Bacchan throws Rani in water; the party scene where Rani lip reads the singer, the campus bench scene where Rani teases Bacchan about the snowfall she predicted, not giving him the umbrella; the kiss scene; the only melodramatic scene in this list - the climax, ""water"".

A constant diet of guns, explosions and emotional violence certainly doesn't model well as a reflection of the nation, does it? It is refreshing to find a beautifully acted story of a man who feels the magnetic pull of the homeland and struggles with giving up all his hard-earned wealth and glory to commit himself to others--what a novel idea! Name a major recent film that suggests such a thing! Very real third-world problems are graphically delineated, but as in other Bollywood films, there is always time for song and dance, and it's fun to take a break.I do not claim greatness for this film, but I was highly entertained every minute and admired the craft it took to marry the music, images and story. We used to make films about heroes and creators and except for the recent Lincoln, they remain far and few. Swades reminds me a good deal of Frank Capra films from the 1930's, but with more color, and certainly a good deal more dance.",Swades
216,Downfall,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1232132/,"I have been fascinated not only by the movie (I have watched this now 10 times) but the divergence of opinion - with some Germans saying it was terrible. This I don't understand. In the West from the time of Charlie Chaplin Hitler was portrayed as a raving lunatic - but to me that does not explain his rise to power. A lunatic could not nearly conquer and enslave half the world. In his early rise to power, he was ridiculed in the West. The fact that this movie gives him some human qualities makes him all the more chilling. There is a dialog between the Junge character and the Braun character that perfectly summarizes Hitler. They talked of the great gulf between the private man and the public man. The Braun character said that she had known the man for 15 years - and yet she knew nothing of him. I believe to truly understand the movie one must also watch the movie with the director's commentary. Everything about this movie - with the exception of 2 things mentioned by the director - (which having just read the spoiler agreement I will refrain from mentioning - everything was based on fact, which makes the movie all the more dramatic. And the movie characters make some minor statements - based on fact - that would be lost on the audience without outside knowledge of those historical facts.Small case in point: The Eva Braun character is telling the Traudl Junge character that she ""so looked forward to coming to Berlin"" with the inference (to me) that she hadn't seen Hitler for awhile. Then I read elsewhere that she was in Obersaltzburg for 6 months away from Hitler prior to coming to Berlin. The director stated that he wanted this movie to be treated not only as a drama - but a documentary. He succeeded in both. I suppose this movie is controversial - a local reviewer said it tried to make Hitler sympathetic by giving him some human qualities but as someone else said this makes him all the more evil. It is these human qualities that make him a believable entity - kind to many individuals, indifferent and murderous to millions. And with the end he was indifferent to the fate of his own people, who were dying for him. Watching this movie made me think that the German people's initial support of Hitler followed a plot from Goethe - that a Mephistopheles - a demon in disguise - promises the recipient all that he wants in return for his soul. This of course is a theme that has subsequently replayed countlessly in western literature since Goethe's Faustus. This movie is based not only on Junge's book and Fest's book, but interviews with some of the survivors of the bunker.I would recommend not only the movie but then watch it with commentary from the director a second time. It is all the more haunting when you realize that virtually everything was based on fact during Berlin's last days.Bruno Ganz - as all the cast - turned in an excellent performance. Watching Ganz in this performance was watching Hitler. You will feel as if you too are a witness in the Bunker. The beginning and end statements by the real secretary Traudl Junge make the movie even more powerful. This movie was so moving for me that I have bought Traudl Junge's book, ""Until the Last Hour"". In the US on the DVD it is said it was nominated for ""best foreign picture"" - if it didn't win, it should have.",N/A
217,Downfall,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1155054/,"I teach a college course on WWII, in graduate school studied under several experts on the subject and have interviewed numerous survivors on both sides. This film comes out on top, perhaps the finest ever made on the subject of the war (though the Belorussian ""Come and See"" & ""Schindler's List"" are darn close as well).I had the remarkable experience of watching this film last night with two veterans, one a GI who fought from Omaha to Czechoslovakia. . .and a German infantry officer, a veteran of four years on the Eastern Front. The German, who met Hitler several times, within minutes was exclaiming over the historical accuracy, right down to ""Hitler's"" lower class Munich accent. . .something an American audience would never pick up on. My German friend, who at the end of the war was in East Prussia, in the debacle of attempting to evacuate over a million civilians ahead of the Russians, was profoundly shaken by the film. . .saying the horror, the hospital scenes, the utter chaos, the lynchings, the sight of 12 year old children fighting. . .all of it was real. And an interesting observation by him. . .he had no idea Berlin, at the end, had been as bad as what he witnessed along the Baltic coast and is still haunted by. It truly was ""Gotterdammerung"" for an entire nation and this film brings it frightfully close to you. If you are a parent of small children, the terrifying ending for the Goebbel's children is an absolutely searing nightmare.I think the most important point of the film was the portrayal of Hitler. . .not as the stereotyped raving madman, usually overplayed like a bad performance of King Richard, but far more subtle. I've talked with many who knew Hitler, including a childhood playmate of Helga, Goebbel's oldest child, and all will tell you that Hitler could be absolutely charming, focused on you, even courtly when with women. The terror is, that even as the actor shows us that ""human"" side, in his soft voice he is dictating orders, observations, and comments of absolute evil. The true form of evil rarely looks evil on the surface, it seduces us with a fair face as it leads, sometimes an entire nation, into damnation.

We go from one pointless subplot to the other just so that we can see these wonderful and enchanting images of worlds we have never seen. The movie never comes together because the creators (director, etc) are too busy making sure they create beautiful images and scenarios. I don't see it as a poetic anti war movie. The book may do that, but this movie is not about anything. In the UK version it is not clear why Howl gives his heart to calcifer. It is not clear why Howl, knowing all his problems would be solved by putting his heart back in, doesn't do it --hey, the heart was always there! It is not clear why the witch of the waste wanted Howl's heart. And it is not clear why the Sophie's mother all of the sudden appears in the movie in the place where she used to live. What happened to the hat shop that it was empty for them to move back in. Pointless. I hate it when artists think form is more important than communicating with audiences.",N/A
219,Howl's Moving Castle,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1283883/,"Probably many people find the story confusing. I felt the same way when I saw it in the theater for the first time! The story seemed arbitrary and I couldn't connect the pieces together (much like I saw ""Ashes of Time"" for the first time). But when I watch it again on the DVD, I realize the movie is probably about one thing: personal freedom.Howl is a free person. He doesn't has a heart and even his home (which is usually characterized as a stable point in one's life) can move :-) He is disguised as different wizards in different counties, and when Sophie asks him how many identities he has, he said ""Enough to guarantee my freedom"". When Sophie confronts Suliman, she comments Howl as ""selfish and cowardly and unpredictable, but he's straight as an arrow. He only wants to be free."" But in Miyazaki's world, nothing is black and white. According to Suliman, Howl's power is too great for a person without heart, and he will eventually becomes a monster (some political figures come to my mind).Sophie, on the other hand, is bounded by responsibilities. She is young, but her heart is old. She refuses the invitation from her friends and keep working at the hat shop. When her sister asks her ""Are you going to spend your life in that shop?"" She replies ""It meant so much to papa. Besides, I'm the eldest."". Even her sister asks her to ""look out for yourself"". When Sophie is turned to an old lady, it actually set her free because the good thing of being old is that one has ""so little to lose"" She becomes more adventurous and takes control of her life. She is very assertive as being the cleaning lady in Howl's castle and even tames Calcifer to cook her food. For Howl, his turning point comes when he refuses to move his castle anymore (I'll leave it to the reader as why he does that) By the end of movie, he regains his heart. He feels terrible because it is like ""trapped under a stone"". And Sophie says, ""Yes, a heart is a heavy burden"".There are other wonderful things in the movie. For example, this is probably one of the few movies that tell me what it is really like to be old. But I do want to highlight the thread about personal freedom as it will help you to tie up the pieces of the story.Since there are 1000 words limit in the comment system, I'll write more in by blog: http://web.mac.com/kenlaw/iWeb/Site/Blog/Blog.html",Howl's Moving Castle
220,A Beautiful Mind,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0779968/,"... and in *no way* as clean, logical, and understandable as in pictured in that pathetic sum of tired Hollywood cliches.I'm 27, and I've spent 16 years of my life struggling through delusional phobia and paranoid hallucinations. Like the main character in the film, I was successful mainly because of logic : because I kept thinking over and over to keep delusion away from reality, and to know what was really going on and what wasn't. In the end, I was really successful because of medication, by the way, but I certainly escaped madness because I knew before I took medication the difference between what was real and what wasn't.So, I feel entitled to tell you that this movie is a total fraud. Not only does it cheat with the main character's story (who wasn't faithful to his wife, who was bisexual - something really important here), but mostly, it shows a comforting, tamed view of schizophrenia - which is entirely missing the point.Schizophrenia is a mind structure, not a disease. A schizophrenic *isn't* a ""normal man with a disease"", it's someone who from early on views and feels things differently from most people : for him, things like time, space, and people's personalities aren't solid things. He feels it can be bent, it can change, it can mutate, and maybe even disappear. To cope with this, a schizophrenic has a rich, very imaginative inner world which ""normal"" people don't expect - but he's trapped in it because he can't relate with most people, and his world gets poorer and poorer until he finishes in a blank, delusive dead end.This is very different to what's depicted in this ridiculous ""cure"", tear-jerking movie. It should be violently frightening. People other than the main character should appear strange, weird and absurd, like in Lynch's ""Eraserhead"", for example. There should be *really* impressive, weird, gross hallucinations, because that's what schizophrenia is all about. It's not about *details*.I mean, watch ""Naked Lunch"", ""Lost Highway"", read P.K. Dick's ""Martian Time-Split"" or ""Ubik"", DO watch ""The Cell"", ""Perfect Blue"", ""Dark City"", or play ""American McGee's Alice"" on PC, and you may have a vague idea of what it's like. Don't watch the ""feel good"" movie of the month, with banal situations, cleaned characters and visuals, and stupid plot tricks. ""The Cell"" is the most accurate movie about a schizophrenic's mind, his visions and his inner consistency - it's violent, weird, confusing, and very, very scary.Once again, Schizophrenia isn't about details, it's not a neat, tame trick played to you. It jumps in your face and won't let you go : walls fall apart, people turn into strange hostile creatures, you feel like you go backward in time, you're not sure you're who you think you are, everything feels... strange, unnatural. Believe me, this is much much more than what's depicted in this soap-like melodrama",N/A
221,Hera Pheri,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0719237/,You won't believe it but it is true that I have seen this movie 17 times and I am still not tired of watching. I saw it on the theatres first and I loved it and then I bought it on DVD. This movie rocks. I love the performance of Paresh Rawal. Akshay kumar and sunil shetty also gives great performances. This movie really makes me laugh. My rating- 10/10,N/A
222,Hera Pheri,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1139040/,"Hera Pheri is a film set in Mumbai and is not your run of the mill slapstick comedy that directors like David Dhawan indulge in. The movie is directed by Priyadarshan who proved that after making such wonderful and serious film like Virasat, he can also direct a comedy with élan.This film is a comedy of error. Set in a Mumbai slum where our three protagonists dwell, the movie depicts the hilarious moments created by the simplicity and/or stupidity of the characters. The look of the film is that of an art film. By the look of it, it seems as if it is going to be a really serious movie but it turns out to be one roller-coaster ride of laughter. The cast of the film includes Sunil Shetty who plays an unemployed guy who comes to Mumbai looking for work and a place to live. He lands up at the house of a simple man played deftly by Paresh Rawal who takes Sunil in. However, there is another person living in the house, namely Raju. Played by Akshay Kumar, Raju is the mischief monger and good for nothing. He keeps on getting jobs and losing them quickly. The story is taken forward by a phone call by the gangster Kabira who keeps on saying that he has kidnapped his grand daughter (sunil takes the call) and wants ransom. This call kickstarts a mayhem. Which ultimately leads us to the climax of the film where the protagonists end up becoming millionaires. Each and every member of the cast is brilliant in the performance of their roles. Sunil Shetty and Akshay Kumar's careers were in doldrums when this film released and both of them gave a stunning performance. Especially Akshay Kumar shows impeccable comic timing. Akshay Kumar is considered of the best comic actors of Bollywood these days after performing comic roles in films like Mujhse Shaadi Karogi, Khakee, Aawara Paagal Deewana and Waqt. However, the show stealer is none other that the unbelievable Paresh Rawal who plays Baburao Ganpatrao Apte. He is an absolute delight to watch. It will be an understatement to say that he completely overshadows the rest of the actors with his marvellous portrayal of a poor Mumbaiyya simpleton. This film changed the course of his career and he is now reckoned as a character actor who adds to the star value of a film. The music is not that good though. The song ""Main Ladka Pom Pom"" is hilarious though. The picturization keeps you in splits even though the song is irritating if you only listen to the audio. The real hero of the film is the dialogue writer Neeraj Vohra who comes up with some never before heard one liners. Anyone who wants another example of his great work must watch Aawara Paagal Deewana. In short, a film for every comedy lover. Some clean entertainment. Moreover, I can confidently say that this is the best comedy film i have seen in my life. Brilliant!",Hera Pheri
223,"Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels",https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0457219/,"If this film had been dubbed for American viewers, (even if it would have lost the magic of the cockney accent), not one person from the States would have said this wasn't a really good film. I didn't even understand most of the dialogues, but the weirdness of the characters and of what they did was really funny.  Not hysterically funny, but Funny! The mixture of comedy and violence was the thing that most amused me.  The story itself isn't of the most original, but surely efficacious. The photography and the soundtrack were also brilliant and to finish, I saw Pulp Fiction, I loved it, but after seeing LS&2SM I was too busy thinking over and over how much I liked it for noticing a whatsoever similarity with PF. 10 out of 10 is a bit too much but  9/10 definitely isn't! Watch it!",N/A
224,"Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels",https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0457209/,"The first time I saw this movie I had difficulty in understanding a lot of the dialogue not just because of the weird accent, but because the actors spoke so damn fast.  But despite this I became literally addicted to it. To begin with my wife got pretty annoyed because any other movie we rented would be ejected after about 20 minutes of viewing and in would go LS&2SB. Now she is hooked as well.I have lost count of the number of times I have seen LS&2SB and still cannot put my finger on why I find this movie so good to watch.  I suppose the most obvious feature of this movie is that it is beautifully balanced between being serious and humorous at the same time.  The characters are two-dimensional.  The villains are menacing, and yet they are made to look like idiots, and the good guys think they are so smart yet keep getting the rug pulled from under them.  They are all projected as 'cool' yet the situation is always out of their control.  Maybe it could be called a satire on true life.The style of this movie is unique, full stop.  I cannot think of any movie that can be compared to LS&2SB.  Quite a few people say that the style is a mix of 'Pulp Fiction', 'Goodfellas', 'Trainspotting' and 'Reservoir Dogs', but I think that you would make that kind of description only if you are really desperate to match LS&2SB to something.The best description I can think of is 'MTV does a crime comedy', and I honestly don't think there is anything wrong with that.  Like music videos, it is all non-stop movement and sound.  Something is always happening but unlike music videos, not without reason.The humor is incredibly sharp yet 'as a matter of fact'.  No one is really trying to be extraordinarily funny, but again it is the balance between being menacingly serious and funny that the humor really flies at you. I think that it is for this reason that a few people are really disappointed with LS&2SB.  If you are expecting a 'belly laugh Leslie Nielson, Jim Carrey, Steve Martin, typecasted' type all out comedy, or a serious 'Al Pacino, Andy Garcia, DeNiro typecasted crime thriller, you will find this movie a big let down.My favorite characters are Rory Breaker (Vas Blackwood) and Big Chris (Vinnie Jones) mainly because their two dimensional over-the-top characters are the most obvious.  Big Chris takes his son with him debt collecting, and while he beats up someone who owes chastises him for swearing in front of his son and Rory Breaker is the most idiotic drug-lord you could come up with.I haven't even mentioned the excellent and unique camerawork, speaker blowing soundtrack, beautifully threaded plot, perfect ending and the grittiest visuals I've seen.  You wont see any reflective glass laden sky scrapers here, or 'over head city shots', or incredible special effects. This movie has actors I have never heard of, dialogues that you have to rewind and replay to understand, buildings that look as though they have been condemned for demolition, cars that wouldn't even be seen in our scrap yards, has probably been made with a budget that most movies in Hollywood use for make-up alone, has no love scenes, or romance or complex relationships, no Oscar-worthy performances, and yet is perfect entertainment.Where our movies normally rely on budgets, this movie works on human talent alone.If any movie deserves a 10 out of 10, then this is it.'And there's one more thing...............it's been emotional'","Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels"
225,The Bandit,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3191805/,"The Bandit, Eskiya, seemed like a melodrama movie with lot of things added and blended beautifully, making it worth watching. But for sure it is not the movie that can decorate the Oscars. A light and grasping movie, it has lot of faces for life and is crafted cohesively.To count for the good points, we can go on with acting of the bandit, the thought of his friend who betrayed him over the concept of love, inability to escape the wrong deeds, silence of the girl, atmosphere for acting and the end scene with the fireworks, enough to win the heart.To count for the negative points, the film has no objective as such, provides melodrama, false figures, no ideas or analysis, a bit of non-realistic story, dull at a times and tries to prove itself rather than being proved itself. A huge number of such drama movies are available.Weighted mean from my ratings /my logic may be biased but remains same for all/ will be 7.4/10.",The Bandit
226,The Bandit,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0383410/,"The 'rebirth' of Turkish cinema is rejoiced with perhaps one of the finest movies to ever appear in Turkey.  It appears the sudden pause of the Turkish cinema due to the lacking quality against the western movie market has resumed, transforming yesilcam and its unique and familiar style into something that is more recognizable by the 'new generation'.  Movies like Kahbe Bizans, Abuzer Kadayif, Eskiya, and TV series like Ikinci Bahar and Yilan Hikayesi are some of the finest examples of this.  Yet these are far more than simple replications of the western styles, these contain an element of the Turkish culture and people that we are so used to seeing. This is the essence of the brilliance beneath Eskiya.  The way it accurately reflects our troubles and the way we deal with them.Beginning with the first scene, we become aware of the how incredibly well written the script is and the realism and truthfulness beneath the characters.  This realism in fact is drawn to such a scale that at no poin t in the movie, do we feel anger at any character, or identify one as evil; merely the victims of the horrible system in which we live in, and the incidents we read in the papers everyday.  While national problems such as migration, organized crime, and poverty are all central themes to the movie, so are human emotions like betrayal and revenge.  Even the bizarre ending filled with numerous deaths appears very natural.The acting also is quite remarkable.  Sener Sen, being a great actor, portrays Baran superbly, while Ugur Yucel with his unquestionable talent does his part and every other role is cast with incredible thought and consideration.  The climax I thought shows this  the best, Sener Sens monologue on the rooftop scene had tears coming out of my eyes.Overall, it would be very unjust to say that this is the greatest Turkish movie to be ever filmed because, being a kid of the new generation, I would simply be completely blocking out 50+ years of yesilcam.  However with it's great script, the warmth we feel towards the characters, and the amazing performances by the actors,  this is one of the best and it most certainly is a symbol of the rebirth of Turkish cinema.  If you are Turkish and haven't seen or heard about this movie, you probably slept through the last 5 years go see it now! And if you're not Turkish, you should still see it.  I recommend it to anyone.",Eskiya

228,Casino,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0358043/,"This movie is entertaining, for sure, but just one attentive glance at the editing and you know Scorcese's struggling to make it work.  The voice-overs simply function to move the plot in places where the filmed action can't take it.  A film relying on voice-over for exposition is usually missing some pieces.  Plus as a movie about how relationships can dissolve there really isn't much to work from.  The Rothstein/Ginger connection is totally breezed over and you get no real sense of their relationship, other than ""he's controlling"" and ""she's nuts.""  Plus Joe Pesci is simply reprising his role from Goodfellas.  In fact it seems the entire movie is just a Goodfellas retread, but without the great pacing and script that kept that classic together.

Few films take so many chances and succeed so wonderfully. It takes some of the basic formulas that were found in Goodfellas and applies them to another type of story - while Goodfellas' view was ground-level, telling the story of the ""blue collar"" gangsters of NYC, this film tells the story of the guys who controlled those guys. And it's fascinating to watch these people run Las Vegas, control the flow of money, and then fall from the heights of power due to lust, hubris, and greed.

I have watched it once. And its not even a one time watch.. I have watched far better comedy movies in Hindi or in any Indian language for that matter. The actors in this movie have become wonderful and performers of Indian cinema, and may be be call it as Indian cinema, But when we talk about this movie, it cannot be in the top 250 list. The rating system should be a little more output oriented. This review and rating is purely on my personal opinion. I am a big fan of Indian cinema.

231,Andaz Apna Apna,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0334518/,"There have been very few great comedy films in the history of Hindi Cinema. Andaz Apna Apna happens to be one of them. The film is based on a very simple story of two poor young men (Aamir and Salman) who dream of becoming rich by marrying a millionaire's daughter (Raveena). Aamir and Salman Khan try their best to outwit each other and woo Raveena. The plot thickens when Paresh Rawal & Co. plan to take over all the wealth. The movie is well paced and very funny. Rarely does one come across a Hindi comedy which is both funny and intelligent. This is one of the few films with Aamir and Salman together (probably the only film!). Unfortunately it did not succeed at the box-office, and we might never see a film of this calibre again. Aamir Khan is brilliant in the film and has proved his versatility as an actor in this film. Salman Khan gives a very good performance as a dim-wit. Raveena plays a convincing role as a confused rich girl, and Karishma who is Raveena's assistant/friend is also funny. Paresh Rawal, Junior Ajith, Shakti Kapoor, Deven Verma, Jagdeep and Tiku Talsania just add to the flavour of the film! All in all, the best Hindi comedy ever made and I wish they make more quality films like this one. You will want to watch this film time and again.P.S - For those of you who have watched this film, I also suggest Gol Maal, Chupke Chupke, Chhoti Si Baat, Naram Garam, Hera Pheri (old and new), etc.",Andaz Apna Apna

Excepting the final shootout, this representation omits the unshootable, the character that could walk through the volley of a dozen Gatling guns and survive. Instead, we're almost treated to something that may be closer to reality but even then, there are leaps of faith and characters that we probably wouldn't recognise in ourselves or those we know, although Clint Eastwood plays himself - he always does, that's why we watch his films.Ultimately it draws a line in the sand, where the heroes of the silver screen replace leather chaps and suede for Lycra and capes - I guess masks are a common theme.

Spielberg and Lucas get back on track after their off the rails first sequel in which to many peoples' horror had none of the Nazis or characters that made Raiders so unique, however, what Spielberg does to make this film a classic is the use of historical data with the swashbuckling storyline of adventure and action.

A lady from the festival committee came to the stage announcing their appology and explaining what the problem was; they were expecting the copy of the film from the its distributor in USA. Unfortunately there was a logistics problem, so they had to get it directly from Yugoslavia. When the festival organisation put their Yugoslavian translators at work they did not understand which language it was! And a cleaning lady, who was an actual gypsy figured out that the movie was in Gypsy language. So it was not possible to translate it for the festival.So they offered an apology and refund in case anybody did not want to watch it without subtitles.Nobody left the theatre.

236,My Neighbor Totoro,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2062650/,"This culturally significant Kodomo anime has become one of the most endeared of all family films without ever having been much popularized or sponsored, which is a testament to its magic. This is one of the tenderly hand-crafted works of Hayao Miyazaki, perhaps the greatest of the Japanese animators, yet his collaborator at the Ghibli Studios, Isao Takahata, who fashioned Grave of the Fireflies, may be his rival. Miyazaki has not until quite lately used computers to animate his films. They are drawn a frame at a time, the time-honored way, with the master himself providing tens of thousands of the frames.Miyazaki's films are in particular viscerally entrancing, using a watercolor look for the backgrounds and working within the unique anime tradition of characters with big round eyes and mouths that can be as minute as a fleck or as enormous as a cave. They also have an spontaneous authenticity in the way they mind minutiae.The movie tells the story of two young sisters who share a wonderful bond. As it opens, their father is driving them to their new house, near a boundless forest. Their mother, who is ill, has been moved to a hospital in this community. Now think about that. The film is about two girls, not two boys or a boy and a girl, as all American cartoon films would be. It has a resolute and loving father, in contradiction to the recent Hollywood affinity for selfish or absent fathers. Their mother is sick: Does sickness happen in American family cartoons?A neighbor boy later tells them their new house is haunted. But not haunted in the American sense, with ghosts or forbidding creations. When the girls let light into the shadow, they get just a peek of little black fuzzy dots scampering to refuge. ''Probably just dust bunnies,'' says their father, but there is an old nanny who has been employed to look after them, and she suggests that they are ''soot sprites,'' which like empty houses, and will pack up and leave when they hear laughter. Perhaps I'm reading too much in, but during this scene, I feel like I caught a brief reference to Ingmar Bergman's Through a Glass Darkly, as one sister stares transfixed at a crack in the wall.Assent to how the father composedly receives their account of arcane critters. Are sprites and totoros for real? They surely do in the minds of the girls. So do other hilarious beasts, such as the Cat Bus, which bustles through the forest on eight fast paws, its big eyes working as headlights. Instead of letting the children be scared of hauntings and the soundness of their own minds, the elders teach them to like and enjoy it all. They go along with it rather than irrationally making them feel silly.While it's not necessarily clear whether or not the adults actually consider them, not once does Miyazaki trot out the relic children's literature adage of The Adults Who Think The Child Is A Liar, So Child Is Going To Have To Save The World Without Them. This welcoming approach to accustomed Japanese spirit-creatures imparts a telling distinction between our two cultures. In America, there must always be something to fear, always a scapegoat, always something or someone to antagonize. No matter how equally violent or aggressive the history is of Japan, they do not thrive on fear factors. It is a beacon of great hope and pleasure to me that family films are the rudimentary place where cultural difference is easiest to discern in the movies.My Neighbor Totoro is made of existence, location and expedition, not on rivalry and danger. This is made crystal in the engrossingly extensive sequences involving totoros, which actually are not Japanese myth, but were indeed created by Miyazaki specifically for this movie. In these sequences, Miyazaki gets no mileage out of any trite ideas about the dark and dreadful forest. It's only nature. Is the film sometimes corny and absurd? Yes, but it knows when to be quiet and real.One of the funniest scenes I think I've ever seen on film occurs when the girls go to meet their father's bus. But the hour grows late and the woods grow dark. Without a sound, matter-of-factly, the giant totoro joins them at the bus stop, standing to one side as if it's been there the whole time. It starts to rain. The girls have umbrellas, and give one to the totoro, who is fascinated by the raindrops on the umbrella, and jumps up and down to render free a downrush of drops from the trees. Watch how coolly and constructively the scene has been handled, with the night, the forest, the lateness of the father seen as a circumstance, not an omen. The movie needs no villains. I remember that Winnie the Pooh also had no evil characters at first, but that in its new American version evil weasels have been interposed into his benevolent setting.But it would never have won its worldwide audience simply owing to its fuzzy heart. It is also full of mortal humor in the manner in which it perceives the two exceptionally authentic, realistic little girls, and I refer to their characterizations, not their physicality. It is side- splitting in the scenes involving the totoro, and in the scenes with the ridiculous Cat Bus. It is a little tearful, a little hair-raising, a little out of the blue and a little enlightening, just like life itself. The film expresses a refreshing ideology with Miyazaki later deepens and defines in his more recent films. Look at the minimal amount of external things in these girls' lives, or their father's, or the nanny's. Their story exists as a situation rather than a plot, and suggests that the uncertainty of life and the makeshifts of invention afford all the enterprising escapades one needs.",My Neighbor Totoro

There are so many wonderful touches, like a tin can in the stream while the kids are fascinated by a fish, or the flying scenes (I'm convinced that Ang Lee thought of Miyazaki when he made The Hulk, just in terms of the jumping scenes) that show a curious mind at work throughout the picture. I also love the sense of magic and innocence (and the lack of violence) which pervades the movie. It is a real antidote from the Disney formula which always involves a villain being trashed at the end. This is a film about the wonder of being a child and experiencing something incredible which adults can't see but recognize nonetheless. It works for any age as well. Enjoy.",Spirited Away

239,Ran,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2298030/,"Akira Kurosawa's 1985, Ran, is based one of Shakespeare's greatest works, King's Lear. The Film proudly stands along with his other classic such as Seven Samurai, Yojimbo, Roshomon, Sanjuro and the Hidden Fortress. He is a master in the art of filmmaking, no one can film an epic battle scene quite like Kurosawa. This is recognized as the most expensive film ever made by Akira Kurosawa, it was at that time, Japan's most expensive film ever. Being at the age of 75, he still showed us, he's one of the best in the business.This movie is about an aging lord, head of the Ichimonji family, decides to retire and to pass the power to Taro, the eldest of his three sons. He will however have to banish Saburo, the youngest one, who dared to speak the truth to him. Soon, the former lord is chased away from the castles of his sons and becomes mad when he understands that one of his sons is trying to kill him. The three brothers are fighting for control of the Kingdom, as their lust for power grows every day. Four armies are facing each other on the prairie. Lord Ichimonji's former peaceful kingdom is nothing but a distant memory.Akira Kurosawa redefines what an epic film is, with astonishing story telling, entirely believable characters and real life battle scenes without the use of Special effects/CGI. He retells the story of King Lear in his own way and no one would recognize that it was actually a adaptation beforehand. But just like Shakespeare, there is humor, irony, death and not a happy ending. Everyone who played a part in the production of this film, deserves some kind of recognition. The acting is pretty much excellent and certainly believable.10/10 Kurosawa is a Genius",Ran
240,Raging Bull,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0179289/,"The routine use of black-and-white film to make movies seems to have ended in the mid-sixties, probably killed off by the advent of colour television. Since then black-and-white has been used very sparingly; even Polanski's `Chinatown', obviously conceived as homage to the films noirs of the 1940s and 1950s, was shot in colour.`Raging Bull'- a biography of the boxer Jake La Motta who for a time held the world middleweight championship- is one of the few exceptions. The use of black-and-white seems to have been inspired by the fact that the film depicts real-life events that occurred in the forties and fifties. Scorsese has tried to capture the look of both the films and the newsreels of that period. This is remarkably effective for the boxing scenes, which have a raw, brutal power and graphically depict the aggressive nature of the sport. The other remarkable thing about the film is the performance of Robert de Niro, for which he won a well-deserved Best Actor Academy Award. De Niro actually learned to box for the film, and did all the boxing scenes himself without using a stunt double, but his portrayal of La Motta's private life is equally effective.Some boxers- Henry Cooper comes to mind- are hard-hitting inside the ring but gentlemanly and restrained outside. La Motta, as portrayed in this film, did not fall into this category. De Niro portrays him as a man with a very short fuse, seething with anger and violence. Unlike his great rival Sugar Ray Robinson, an elegant practitioner of the art of boxing, La Motta tries to overpower his rivals with brute force rather than relying on skill. His aggression is not something confined to the ring, but rather an inherent part of his personality, and comes out in his dealings with others. He treats his beautiful wife Vicki particularly badly, frequently (and irrationally) suspecting her of infidelity and subjecting her to both verbal and physical abuse. Besides De Niro's dominating performance, there are also very good contributions from Cathy Moriarty as Vicki and from Joe Pesci as La Motta's loyal brother Joey, another frequent target of abuse despite his loyalty.For me, this is a very good film, yet one that falls just short of the classic status that some have claimed for it. At times it is enthralling to watch, but at others, particularly in the first half, it seems to lack structure, as La Motta takes on a series of opponents without the significance of these fights ever becoming clear. More could have been made of the gambling-inspired corruption that infested the sport at this period and which may well have contributed to La Motta's sense of frustration- at one time it is made clear to him that his getting a chance to fight for the world title depends upon his taking a dive in a non-title fight. The main weakness, however, is a sense of emptiness at its centre, resulting from the lack of a character who can engage our sympathies. As I said, it is De Niro's performance that dominates the film, but for all his fine acting, even he cannot make us sympathise with a drunken, self-pitying, paranoid, violent wife-beater. As a character study of an unpleasant character it is excellent, but it can go no further than that. I cannot agree that this is the greatest film of the eighties; indeed, for me it was not even the greatest sporting film of the eighties. (I preferred both `Chariots of Fire' and `Eight Men Out'). It is an easy film to admire, but a difficult one to love. 7/10.",Raging Bull
241,The Message,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1264821/,"I saw this film again after a span of almost 25 years and was as impressed as I was back then. Superb acting, excellent re-creations and un-matched visuals. The content and its presentation is in a class of its own and it's a pity that politics did not allow the proper running of this movie when it was first released. In the light of the serious misunderstandings and disagreements that have created fissures between the Muslims and the Western Powers, I believe it is a MUST for this film to be re-released. In fact someone should take on the task and make a sequel to it, as a salute to Moustapha Akkad, a legend of his time.",N/A

243,Sholay,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2865994/,"This movie is just one of the best Hindi movie i have seen. Its one of my favorite film. It has all the elements that a good Hindi movie must have.
The settings of the hilly mountainous village, the dusty n tough terrain, the train sequence n the villain Gabbar played menacingly by Amjad Khan, were all awesome. Such is the impact of the villains acting is that u always remember him by his character's name frm the movie. One of the movies you remember for life.
Amitabh Bachan and Dharmendra were awesome too. The character of Hema malini was cheesy n unbelieavable though. A woman riding a horse chariot that too in the cow belt area wher rape is rampant. Nevertheles the film is solid entertainment. 
It is a story of friendship, courage and revenge, based loosely around the concepts of Akira Kurosawa's Seven Samurai & The Magnificent Seven with shades of Once uopn a time in the west.
A true cinematic masterpiece.",Sholay
244,Monty Python and the Holy Grail,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1303287/,"Monty Python will always be loved or hated depending on your personality. And this is Monty Python at its typical best. If you like daft jokes, killer fluffy animals, bad accents and intelligent discussions that will most likely go over your head the first time round, then you will love The Holy Grail.The jokes vary from obvious visual puns (coconut halves to represent horses) and audio puns (""I am Roger the Shrubber"") to more subtle and intelligent jokes (""I thought we were an autonomous collective"" / the Witch-burning scene). The greatest thing about the Holy Grail is that there's something for everyone. No one is left out.What many don't realise is the sophisticated intelligence behind the jokes that many of later generations don't understand (back in the Life of Brian - Romani Ite Domun - which wouldn't have such impact on the youngsters who never had to suffer through Latin classes) such as the witch burning scene, where it was true that any means possible was used to warp the natural and legal laws to create the desired result i.e. one less warty woman in the village, and how the mish-mash of Celtic tribes were suddenly forced to become a diplomacy (""Strange women lying in ponds distributing swords is no basis for a system of government. Supreme executive power derives from a mandate from the masses, not from some farcical aquatic ceremony!""). It always reminds me of Blackadder - how so many great jokes were wasted by bad timing or bad judgement on the audience's vocabulary.And for those who can't keep up with historical jokes, there's the Black Knight, Tim, and Zoot to keep you occupied. They sure as hell make me laugh.So if you like daft humour, go for it! But promise to check out the subtle jokes as well. It's worth the effort, and you'll learn a little about history too.",Monty Python and the Holy Grail

The first time a saw it I laughed to tears and this is the only time that counts. The first time you get the best experience. I really envy those who haven't seen it yet.

Especially the opening scene: ""Are you trying to say that coconuts migrate"" or when John Cleese trying to be Tarzan, hanging on the rope said: ""Can somebody give me a push."" An absolute masterpiece.
Considering the low budget that the creators of the movie had at their disposal would probably make ""The Holy Grail"" the best movie in this genre-silly nonsense kind of stuff.

247,To Kill a Mockingbird,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0079452/,"TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD is presented like a play in three acts. It is also from the children's perspective. Through the kids, we find that racism is a learned attitude or feeling. We also see a delightful coming of age drama as the young kids realize that there is no Boogeyman down the street and their father is capable of doing a lot more than they think. The great Gregory Peck plays Atticus Finch, a pillar of nobility, social conscience, and, rare for 1930's Americana, a single parent. Peck is such a strong presence, you believe everything about him. It is something you can compare to America's trust in TV anchorman Walter Cronkite. We always took his word for it.Act one puts Atticus in the background and allows the kids to flourish. Director Robert Mulligan was able to get such realistic performances from non-professional kids. They are amusing and fun to watch. The big mystery lies in the house down the street in this small Georgia town. Who is the monstrous, ""6 and a half feet big"" legend living in the end house? Some light suspense ensues, while the buildup to a stirring act two is happening. Atticus must defend an African-American man for the alleged rape of a white woman.After threats galore, an unshaken Peck takes to the courtroom jungle in, without a doubt, one of the top 5 court scenes in motion picture history. Brock Peters lends the film its best moments as the accused ""negro"" on trial. This man has a face chiseled with suffering and deep, deep sorrow. We know Atticus is a good man, a decent human being with a soul. He sees this in his client as well, and in a closing argument that must have roused the civil rights movement, implores the jury to vote justice. An all-male, all-white jury in the 1930's were tough listeners. Peters' breakdown on the stand is one of the most realistic, emotionally saddening moments you'll ever see, especially in Hollywood films of the 1960's. The scene when Peck leaves the courtroom is now legendary as well.Act three produces a tragic death, an unlikely hero, and the bringing together of a family. The filmmakers have such a passion for the material, they seem to handle it with gentleness. Racism is a hard-boiled subject and it is depicted and dealt with through grace and patience. TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD poses the injustice of race relations in the 1930's as a front for the events happening in the 1960's. The film came out during turbulent times and was also an adaption of a literary classic. I am one to judge a film solely by film only. The book is a separate art form and should not be compared to the film, an art form itself. It is important, it is enlightening, and it has not aged. Watch it.RATING: 9 of 10",To Kill a Mockingbird
248,Yojimbo,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0076043/,"Spoilers herein.We are indebted to Kurosawa for one big thing and a couple small ones. Among the small ones is the deconstruction of the western, which was transformed forever by the chain of events started by (and depicted in?) this film. I recommend Yojimbo if only because of this importance.That chain starts with the spaghetti westerns which introduced irony into most elements of the form more obviously for us, well westerners. And it finishes (probably) with `Star Wars,' which is nothing more than a slightly shifted selfaware goof on the already outed western. That this is based on a Hammett story should be a tipoff as he did the same for the mystery genre. Kurosawa did this knowingly of course. You can see his other projects marching through other notions of film and revolutionizing them.Naturally, there are other values here: perfect framing; multiplanar visual storytelling through mime; and a camera that denotes the eye of fate. But by the time one gets to this after seeing such masterpieces as `Ran' and `Rashomon' and `Seven Samurai,' especially the first, one gets used to expecting skill from Kurosawa equalling the skill of his samurai avatar.If you know what this movie is all about, it puts `Last Man Standing' in a much more intelligent and cinematically important perspective. The title of this comment refers to the fact that it is essentially impossible to see any movie today and not be in part watching a Kurosawa film.Ted's Evaluation: 3 of 4 -- worth watching",Yojimbo
249,Yojimbo,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0076037/,"Only a handful of directors know atmosphere the way Akira Kurosawa does, only a handful. Yojinbo opens with a tracking shot of a ronin samurai walking down a dusty road. The camera wisely stays behind the samurai, played by Toshiro Mifune, so we cannot see his face or expressions. This samurai is desperate. Mifune has no master and no money. Kurosawa doesn't let you see his desperation, instead focusing on the back of his head and his profile to set up one of the most memorable characters in cinema history. The film has been copied many times, its practically the most influential film of the modern action genre. Yojinbo isn't action packed however, Kurosawa takes his time setting up characters and plot. The fact that this masterless samurai has deep compassion for strangers is different than most modern action movies alone. Toshiro Mifune is magical in the lead role. His presence is felt all throughout the film even when he isn't on camera. All film buffs should watch this film, it is a perfect example of a director and actor with confidence in their craft.",Yojinbo
250,Judgment at Nuremberg,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0074590/,"SPOILER: This is perhaps one of the best movies regarding WWII because of the point that Spencer Tracy's character makes towards the end of the movie in his summation. He points out that the defendants were people of ability and intelligence- some were even remarkable.  If all of the people that helped this terrible thing along were depraved criminals and monsters, then these events would have no more moral significance than an earthquake or a flood. That good, even remarkable people in a time of crisis can delude themselves into heinous crimes against humanity is something to remember, to be guarded against. Personal morality is more important than the good of the state or going along with someone else's idea of right. The movie is a bit long, it actually takes the time to go into depth with the characters. It is definitely a powerful statement about personal responsibility. In one of the closing lines, Burt Lancaster's character (a defendant) tells Spencer Tracy's character (a judge) that he never knew it would come to that- all those people, he never knew. Tracy's character tells him that is came to that the minute he sentenced a man to death that he knew to be innocent.",Judgment at Nuremberg
251,Judgment at Nuremberg,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2014820/,"This quote is one of the most shocking and yet truthful quotes I have ever heard. It is one of many shocking and intense quotes in the movie. Furthermore Judgment at Nuremburg is one of the most absorbing movies I have seen. Even though most if not all of it is dialog it is very much a haunting film. This film is loosely based on the trials in Nuremburg in 1948. Right from the start the movie captures your mind and never lets it go. The acting was collectively amazing. One of the best casts ever assembled which included Spencer Tracy, Montgomery Clift, Judy Garland, Richard Widmark, Burt Lancaster as well as international stars Maximilian Schell and Marlene Dietrich. It is not just the fact that this is a star studded cast that made it so great, it was the way everyone appeared to blend in together. Maximilian Schell gave the performance of his life in this film playing the defense lawyer for Burt Lancaster who give two superb narratives that will certainly stay in your mind forever. Schell's character use of logic is that of something which will mesmerize use you whether or not you agree or disagree with what he says. Richard Widmark playing the prosecutor gave the type of supporting performance that was necessary for Schell to shine. The way both actors fed off each other was a joy to watch. Then of course the tiny appearances of Garland and Clift were excellent and worth every second they spent on camera. I usually find myself frustrated with cameos and actors receiving recognition for them but this film used cameos the best way I have ever seen. Then of course Spencer Tracy and Marlene Dietrich provided such great presence were perfect for the lead.The direction of Stanley Kramer was spectacular as the film intensified more and more as it wore on. It was always engrossing and never let up. The writing of Abby Mann was great, filled up with great material and narratives allowing every actor in the cast to give a superb performance. There were many memorable quotes as well. The writing carried the film forward and allowed all the potential and talent to push this film to another level.Judgement at Nuremburg is not just another movie. It is a very thought provoking movie. More than that though it is haunting. Just thinking about the course of the events being talked about in the movie became subtly haunting in a way I really didn't expect. What was the most compelling though was the way we need to separate what we feel with what has to be truly done, with what is truly right.",Judgment at Nuremberg
252,Some Like It Hot,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2696668/,"Legendary comedy masterpiece from filmmaker Billy Wilder and IAL Diamond that Won Oscar and another 13 wins & 8 nominations . Immensely charming comedy set among Chicago and Miami , being starred by an all-star-cast . When two unemployed musicians witness a mob hit , the St Valentine massacre in Chicago carried out by mobster chief (George Raft) they flee the state in an all female band disguised as women and headed for Florida , but further complications set in. There appears a gorgeous singer , Sugar Kane (Marilyn Monroe) , who is object of pursuit by the musicians (Jack Lemmon , Tony Curtis) who cannot reveal their identity because are dressed as women in order to getaway from killer gangsters' retaliation . Rightly enjoyable and fun-filled , milestone comedy which neatly combines humor , mirth , entertaining situations and amusement . This noisy comedy is intelligently and pleasingly written to gives us lots of fun , laughters and smiles . Mordantly funny , though by time of premiere was rated as bad taste and some discomfort ; however , is todays considered a real classic movie . Billy Wilder kept the studio Paramount happy , the picture consistently made money and was hit at box office . Flawless comedy with a trio of sensational protagonists , including an unforgettable Marilyn who parades sexily at her best and more relaxed and enticing than ever . The hit of the show is undoubtedly for the fetching Marilyn Monroe who gives one of the best screen acting and sings marvelous songs as ¨Running wild¨, ¨I'm through with love¨ and the immortal ¨I wanna be loved you¨. Magnificent performances from Jack Lemmon as angst-ridden musician dressed in drag and sensational Tony Curtis as a philander young , playing his Gary Gray Grant impression . Furthermore , a splendid secondary cast , a variety of notorious actors who make sympathetic interpretations such as Pat O'Brien , George Raft , Mike Mazurski , Nehemia Persoff and , of course, smitten Joe E Brown , including his now-classic closing line . The motion picture was very well directed by Billy Wilder who includes several punchlines . Billy was one of the best directors of history . In 1939 started the partnership with Charles Bracket on such movies as ¨Ninotchka¨ , ¨Ball of fire¨ , making their film debut as such with ¨Major and the minor¨ . ¨Sunset Boulevard¨ was their last picture together before they split up . Later on , Billy collaborated with another excellent screenwriter IAL Diamond . Both of them won an Academy Award for ¨Stalag 17¨ dealing with a POW camp starred by William Holden . After that , they wrote/produced/directed such classics as ¨Ace in the hole¨ , the touching romantic comedy ¨Sabrina¨ , the Hickcoktian courtroom puzzle game ¨Witness for the prosecution¨ and two movies with the great star Marilyn Monroe , the warmth ¨Seven year itch¨ and this ¨Some like hot¨. All of them include screenplays that sizzle with wit . But their biggest success and highpoint resulted to be the sour and fun ¨¨The apartment¨. Subsequently in the 60s and 70s , the duo fell headlong into the pit , they realized nice though unsuccessful movies as ¨Buddy buddy¨ ,¨Fedora¨ , ¨Front page¨ and ¨Secret life of Sherlock Holmes¨, though the agreeable ¨Avanti¨ slowed the decline . The team had almost disappeared beneath a wave of bad reviews and failures . ¨Some like hot¨ rating : Above average , essential and indispensable watching ; extremely funny and riveting film and completely entertaining . It justly deserves its place among the best comedy ever made . One of the very funniest films of all time and to see and see again . It's the kind of movie where you know what's coming but , because the treatment , enjoy it all the same .",Some Like It Hot

Clearly he had put the question to himself before and had arrived to a perfectly sensible conclusion. Everything in this gem of a movie had been thought so cleverly and as it turned out so prophetically, that the world of our three characters, a world of prohibition and gang wars could be today and more than likely will be tomorrow. Billy Wilder analyzes human nature with an acid eye and a glorious panache for underlining our most endearing features. Our frailties. Marilyn Monroes is at her pick, the sadness in her eyes a startling metaphor in a comedy about wanting. Tony Curtis with an Eve Arden's pout is so beautiful, so charming, imitating Cary Grant and trying to be himself that, in my mind he'll be always be in a frock. And, of course, Jack Lemmon, throwing himself into the part, body and should. Only perfection can allow to end its course with a line like ""Nobody's perfect""",Some Like It Hot
254,The Seventh Seal,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0062644/,"Spoilers herein.Bergman is much loved because of his sheer passion, its intimate rawness and the ability to present it visually. He was able to sustain that uncomfortable ability for decades, but this film also has something else -- unique in his work -- a particularly complex narrative architecture.Ordinary stories are just there, with no recognition of being told: but those are remarkably uninteresting. Nearly everything worth reading, hearing or seeing has some sort of the recognition of telling, often by putting the telling explicitly in the story as in `Hamlet.' Sometimes it gets turned on its head when the telling element becomes the focus, as in `Rosencrantz and Guildenstern.'But here that notion of one fold in space becomes seven. The story we see is: a game, a collection of visions, a mural, a book of the Bible, a performance by players, an obsessive religious ritual, and the movie itself (the seventh seal). Each encapsulates the other. We have seven characters that advocate or represent each of these, apart from the `crusade' of real life.This is so complex and so finely woven it changed the entire world. Everything that came after sees it as perhaps an unwelcome spectral visitor, perhaps a template (see `Ninth Gate'), perhaps as a stack of parts from which one borrows. But everyone sees it and is changed.My favorite working filmmaker is Greenaway. He says of this, that when he saw it, he knew he had to be a filmmaker. I believe most of us who actually see this will be similarly changed. Bergman was never able to weave as fine a narrative lace again.",The Seventh Seal
255,The Seventh Seal,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0062659/,"Middle Ages: Antonius Blok, a Swedish knight, returns from the Crusades only to find his country dying of the plague, religious fundamentalists taking over and Death himself wanting him to come along. Antonius challenges Death to a game of chess and is meanwhile driven to desperation because of the absence of God. This description sounds like a very serious, philosophical and dour film, and actually it is serious, philosophical and dour; but there is also a little warmth, hope and humor, maybe not for Antonius, but for the viewer.When Blok and Death interrupt their game of chess (due to the plague, Death is very busy), he meets two actors, Jof and Mia, with their little son, the most human characters of the film, and I don't think it's a coincidence that there names sound very much like Joseph and Mary. These people may be a little dim, but they are good at heart and you can see the happiness in Antonius' eyes when he is together with them for the first time.
But the main aspect of Ingmar Bergman's arguably best film are Antonius Blok's grim encounters, as the young girl about to be burnt at the stake, as a scapegoat for the plague. And the haunting image of a huge crowd of flagellants interrupting a play of Jof and Mia and trying to convince the crowd thery are doomed; hardly any other film is that direct in asking controversial and essential questions about God, religion and mankind as The Seventh Seal.Another reason for the impact this almost 50-year-old film has still today is the acting: Max von Sydow's face always seems to reflect what Antonius Blok is thinking, Nils Poppe's performance as the naive actor and caring father is priceless and Bengt Ekerot's Death became a part of film history and survived all its spoofs (the best one being in Woody Allen's tremendously funny ""Love and Death""). But the best performance is done by Gunnar Björnstrand as Antonios Blok's misogynist squire, dryly commenting all their encounters even in the face of death.The Seventh Seal is not subtle in raising it's questions, that's for sure. But it makes you think about these questions nevertheless. It's disturbing and grim most of the time, but at the end it gives you the hope that it might become better.",The Seventh Seal

258,Tokyo Story,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0984789/,Tokyo monogatari (or Tokyo Story) is a very human story. It contains a lot of everyday life which at times can make it difficult to follow since it may feel a little bit slow.However who is patient gets rewarded. And Ozus way of telling this story is very quiet but effective. The images he produces and the very minimalist camera work creates a rhythm that sucks the viewer in and slowly opens him/her up for the sad but essential ending of this movie.Ozu never tries to impose his story to the viewer. It looks like he follows his actors very disciplined and calm. This very structured and clear camera-work will alienate many modern moviegoers who are used to much more dynamic images. However lovers of purist cinema and fans of Aki Kaurismaki will probably love it.Impressing also to see how close the everyday life of Japan in the mid 50s is to the western way of life.,Tokyo Story
259,Tokyo Story,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1237040/,"I think this movie is amazing for reasons I was not expecting. I had heard of Yasujiro Ozu's ""Tokyo Story"" for several years but never had an opportunity to see it until Criterion resuscitated it as part of their DVD collection. Over fifty years old, this wondrous 1953 film resonates just as deeply today. Those outside Japan rarely get to see a Japanese film classic that doesn't involve samurai warriors in medieval battles. This one, however, is a subtly observed family drama set in post-WWII Japan, and it is the quietude and lack of pretense of Ozu's film-making style that makes this among the most moving of films.The plot centers on Shukishi and Tomi, an elderly couple, who traverse the country from their southern fishing village of Onomichi to visit their adult children, daughter Shige and son Koichi, in Tokyo. Leading their own busy lives, the children realize their obligation to entertain them and pack them off to Atami, a nearby resort targeted to weekend revelers. Returning to Tokyo unexpectedly, Tomi visits their kindly daughter-in-law, Noriko, the widow of second son Shoji, while Shukishi gets drunk with some old companions. The old couple realizes they have become a burden to their children and decide to return to Onomichi. They also have a younger daughter Kyoko, a schoolteacher who lives with them, and younger son Keizo works for the train company in Osaka. By now the children, except for Kyoko and the dutiful Noriko, have given up on their parents, even when Tomi takes ill in Osaka on the way back home. From this seemingly convoluted, trivial-sounding storyline, fraught with soap opera possibilities, Ozu has fashioned a heartfelt and ultimately ironic film that focuses on the details in people's lives rather than a single dramatic situation.What fascinates me about Ozu's idiosyncratic style is how he relies on insinuation to carry his story forward. In fact, some of the more critical events happen off-camera because Ozu's simple, penetrating observations of these characters' lives remain powerfully insightful without being contrived. Ozu scholar David Desser, who provides insightful commentary on the alternate audio track, explains this concept as ""narrative ellipses"", Ozu's singularly effective means of providing emotional continuity to a story without providing all the predictable detail in between. Ozu also positions his camera low throughout his film to replicate the perspective of someone sitting on a tatami mat. It adds significantly to the humanity he evokes. There are no melodramatic confrontations among the characters, no masochistic showboating, and the dialogue is deceptively casual, as even the most off-hand remark bears weight into the story. The film condemns no one and its sense of inevitability carries with it only certain resigned sadness. What amazes me most is how the ending is so cathartic because the characters feel so real to me, not because there are manipulative plot developments, even death, which force me to feel for them.I just love the performances, as they have a neo-realism that makes them all the more affecting. Chishu Ryu and Chieko Higashiyama are wonderfully authentic as Shukishi and Tomi, perfectly conveying the resignation they feel about their lives and their children without slipping into cheap sentimentality. Higashiyama effortlessly displays the sunny demeanor of a grandmother, so when sadness does take over in her life, it becomes all the more haunting. In particular, she has a beautiful scene where Tomi looks forlornly at her grandchild wondering what he will be when he grows up and whether she will live to see what happens. Even more heartbreaking is the scene where Shukishi and Tomi sit in Ueno Park realizing their children have no time for them and are resigned to the fact that they need to find a place to sleep for the night. The closest the film has to a villain is Shige, portrayed fearlessly by Haruko Sugimura, who is able to show respect, pettiness and conniving in a realistically mercurial fashion. Watch her as she complains about the expensive cakes her husband bought for her parents (as she selfishly eats them herself) or how she finagles Koichi to co-finance the trip to Atami or how she shows her frustration when her parents come home early from the spa. So Yamamura (familiar to later Western audiences as Admiral Yamamoto in ""Tora! Tora! Tora!"") displays the right amount of indifference as Koichi, and Kyoko Kagawa has a few sharp lines toward the end of the film as the disappointed Kyoko.But the best performance comes from the legendary Setsuko Hara, a luminous actress whose beauty and sensitivity remind me of Olivia de Havilland during the same era. As Noriko, she is breathtaking in showing her character's modesty, her unforced generosity in spite of her downscale status and her constant smile as a mask for her pain. She has a number of deeply affecting moments, for instance, when Noriko explains to Shukishi and Tomi how she misses her husband, even though it is implied he was a brutalizing alcoholic; or the touching goodbye to Kyoko; or her pained embarrassment over the high esteem that Shukishi holds for her kindness. Don't expect fireworks or any shocking moments, just a powerfully emotional film in spite of its seemingly modest approach. The two-disc DVD set has the commentary from Desser on the first disc, as well as the trailer. On the second disc, there are two excellent documentaries. One is a comprehensive 1983, two-hour feature focused on Ozu's life and career, and the second is a 40-minute tribute from several international movie directors.",Tokyo Story
260,Rashomon,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1780580/,"This was Kurosawa's first big international hit, from then on his films would be avidly watched and (usually) feted as Art. His style was always so breathtakingly simple that you can't help but get sucked into the rainy and sunny bestial world depicted in here, with a beautiful use of the black and white nitrate film stock contrasting against a sordid storyline. I've probably seen it 10 times now over the decades and it seems to get better every time I settle down to it - it's been a continual treat.A horror story from a few days previous is recounted on a ferociously wet day: beautiful woman is (apparently) raped by animalistic bandit in front of her husband who is then (apparently) murdered. But who really did what to who and why? It's told from four viewpoints: the bandit's, the honourable woman's, the heroic dead husband's via a rather startling medium and lastly a breathless version from a timid eye-witness. The event becomes a crime scene with the beauty of forest surrounding us and splintered sunlight beaming down on us through the trees bearing mute witness to the savage few moments. It's a salutary lesson in Human Beings vs Objectivity; the psychologies of the main protagonists are laid bare, as well as the story-tellers, even to Kurosawa and the viewers themselves. Who's telling the truth/ was it a mixture of all versions/ was there another truth untold? Only you can decide!I urge all innocent bystanders who have a problem with b&w non-HD 4:3 subtitled Japanese films from 1950 to try to get over it!

261,Rashomon,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1256500/,"To have a film that holds the coveted title of being the reason that the ""Best Foreign Film"" category was created for the Oscars is one thing, but to be able to back up that myth with a powerful film that speaks both about humanity and the strength of truth is a whole new angle. Often we witness powerful foreign films that slip through the lines of cinema, regarded by so many as valuable assets to the film community, but never see the gold of Oscar. In the same sense, sometimes the most popular of those foreign films eventually become Oscar contenders, not because they are worthy enough, but because studios had the funds to allow bigger distribution to audiences, thus allowing popularity to do the rest. Rashômon is one of those few films that succeed in giving us both a quality film and the accolades to represent it. Rashômon is a rare breed of film. The Japanese filmmaker Akira Kurosawa took many bold steps with this film (pointing his camera at the sun, filming deep within the jungle, and the mockery of truth), that it is unlikely that you could go to a modern day Hollywood film without seeing one of these techniques being ""borrowed"". His bold storytelling, creative camera work, and powerful characters give us a unique story that should be included in everyone's film library.While the characters were strong, the direction was flawless, and the story was compelling, there is a theme that needs to be discussed while talking about Rashômon. This is the story of murder, betrayal, and rape and in any typical ""courthouse"" film you would have some spineless witness finally break down and confess the truth. At the end of these films the truth is discovered, but not in Rashômon. Kurosawa gives us the ""black sheep"" of themes by never really giving us what we really wanted from the beginning of this story. As I began this film, I thought I was going to get a clear-cut story with honesty and troubled souls, but instead I was handed no prize at the end. What I sought after the most is not handed to me in a Happy Meal container at the end, but instead trapped still within the film. Kurosawa gives us the meaning behind the story, that there possibly is no way of knowing the true ""truth"". Four different souls, seeing the same event all culminating to four different results means that the ""truth"" may never be known. Kurosawa has taken the story and provided us with the main character being truth, and like Kaiser Soze, the greatest trick it ever pulled was convincing us that ""it didn't exist"". Deep within Rashômon the truth is hidden, and it may never emerge, but that is what Kurosawa intended. A viewer could walk away from this film, after several viewings, and discover different truths about the characters and story. This is a constantly evolving film that will continually get better with time.Outside of these beautiful themes, Rashômon is a flawless film. From the execution of the actors to the simplicity of the direction, there is plenty in this film to keep your mind busy and your jaw nearly dragging on the floor. To begin, the performance by Toshiro Mifune ranks among the best in film history. In each of the stories he is portrayed differently (even in his own) and with precise execution he delivers every time. He is insane, passionate, loyal, and villainous all at the same time. While some may see his acting as eccentric or over-the-top, I found each of his portrayals as accurate and astute. When Mifune is on the screen his presence commands your eyes and you cannot help but become involved. Second to his performance is that of the troubled wife. While her characters is the most confusing/suspicious of them all, Masayuki Mori keeps us intertwined with the story by controlling her character with the greatest of ease. When it is time for her to be unleashed, the true drama of the story is thrown in your face with brilliance and expertise.Overall, I thought that this was a near perfect film. Kurosawa is intense, original, and adeptly secure about his stories. I have seen the same passion in Ran, and it cannot be denied. My only concern with this film is that if you are going to watch this movie, make sure that you can devote your entire mind to it. I found myself watching it three times because I could not stay focused (outside factors) enough to see those darkly hidden themes. I especially enjoyed the unearthed darkness of humanity, which is hinted on at the end. The fact that after hearing these stories of murder and rape, it doesn't stop one from continuing along a similar path. It is a powerful tale that should be enjoyed by all! Grade: **** out of *****",Rashômon
262,All About Eve,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0041791/,"I'm afraid I'm not going to join the gush parade for this movie.The performances are good, Eve and Margo are well-done characters, and the ending is like something out of the Twilight Zone, but the movie also has a number of shortcomings.It's very talky -- nothing but talk, hardly a moment of silence. The dialogue seems more stagey than natural. The characters don't converse so much as declaim or emote. The dialogue doesn't seem witty as some have claimed, just bitter and cynical (for the most part).The visuals aren't very visual. The shots are mostly ordinary shots of whoever's talking at the moment. There's little character movement. This could easily have been a radio play.The relationship between Margo and boyfriend seems contrived. There's no apparent reason why they should be so attached to each other. It doesn't come across. In fact, they seem quite unattached to each other initially, but the movie changes its mind abruptly in midcourse.I'll confess a bias against actors acting about acting. It's the kind of self-referential, self-reverential stuff that bugs me, like news reporters reporting on each other instead of the news, or playwrights writing plays about plays. It smacks of taking oneself far too seriously. (Okay, it's a pet peeve, but there you go.)But despite these shortcomings, it's still worth watching to the end.",N/A

264,To Be or Not to Be,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1337467/,"This is one of the great movie farces of all time. I would rank it very close to my all time favorite ""Dr. Strangelove."" There are several tiers of interpretation as is true of any noteworthy satire. It is not only poking fun at the stupidity and vanity of Nazism, but at aggressive war in general. Referring to Joseph Tura (Jack Benny) playing Hamlet on stage, Colonel Ehrhardt (Sig Ruman) states, ""What he did to Shakespeare we are doing to Poland."" Only someone with the comic genius of Ernst Lubitsch could compare the Thespian rape of Shakespeare with the physical rape of a country and make it work.Jack Benny, although one of the most popular entertainers of all time, never got his just deserts for his acting abilities. Though he utilizes many of his physical mannerisms that worked so well for his comedy routines on radio, in the movies, and later on TV, he also does some very fine acting in ""To Be Or Not To Be."" He is teamed with the multi-talented Carole Lombard yet keeps up with her all the way. The two work well together. Had Carole Lombard not been tragically killed in a plane crash while serving her country just before the release of this film, she would possibly have been teamed with Benny again. The rest of the cast, including newcomer Robert Stack, keep up the pace and give all the support needed to make Lubitsch's film a winner, in particular the histrionics of Sig Ruman, the definitive Nazi stooge, later parodied in the popular TV series ""Hogan's Heroes.""The script which Lubitsch himself helped put together blossoms with hilarious one-liners such as ""So they call me Concentration Camp Ehrhardt?"" To read a few of the most famous ones, see IMDb quotes for the film. Better still, rent or buy a copy of this classic and watch it a few times to hear them for yourself. IMDb only lists some, not all, for that would take several pages.The story sounds like one for a typical romantic or screwball type comedy. A troupe of Shakespearean actors in Warsaw, Poland, appear to be on the road to success due to the fame of the leading lady, Maria Tura (Carole Lombard). Her husband, Joseph (Benny), seems to be in her shadow, though he does his best as the Prince of Denmark, Hamlet. Yet each time he does the famous soliloquy that begins, ""To be or not to be,"" the same man gets up and walks out. This leads Joseph to think he is a failure as Hamlet until later in the film he learns that the young man, Lt. Stanislav Sobinski (Robert Stack), is leaving each time for a rendezvous with Joseph's wife, Maria. At this point Hitler invades Poland and the theater is closed as the Nazi's come to town. A Nazi professor, Prof. Alexander Siletsky (Stanley Ridges), flies in with a list of names of traitors (Polish patriots) who are to be taken care of by the local Gestapo headed by Col. Ehrhardt (Ruman). It is up to the Shakespearean troupe to keep these names out of the hands of the Gestapo and then to escape with their lives. So they use their acting talents to impersonate Gestapo officers and even Hitler himself. Joseph becomes Ehrhardt but botches it when the professor brings up the relationship between Maria and Lt. Sobinski who is now in Warsaw also. The rest of the film involves several funny mix-ups and mistaken identities filled with satirical buffoonery. Though this was somewhat controversial when first released because some, including Jack Benny's own father, misunderstood the satire, the film is possibly even more funny and relevant today than during World War II when the Nazi menace was for real. Because Lubitsch made the spoof universal in nature, ""To Be Or Not To Be"" transcends time and space.",To Be or Not to Be
265,To Be or Not to Be,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2925281/,"Comedies rarely stand the test of time - this one does: one of the funniest films I have ever seen.When I was 16 (20 years ago, sigh...), this was re-released for a short time in a local art-house cinema, and my father insisted I go watching it with a friend. Well, teenagers don't normally line up to see 50 year old black and white comedies, but - man, was I glad I did!This is a pitch black comedy that feels as fresh today as it must have then; in fact, this must have been kind of a shock in 1942. There are no cheesy clean characters or cringe-worthy lines: this is a firework of fast, witty dialogue with an edge and the sexiest, cleverest (and most morally ambiguous) female protagonist I have ever seen in a film before the ""New Hollywod"" era.Even the structure and the way the story evolves are very modern; there are flashbacks and twists and turns that might be very common in contemporary films but must have seemed almost ""avant-garde"" at the time.The biggest fun, of course, is how Lubitsch takes the pi** out of Hitler's blind, fanatic followers. I don't believe the Nazis have ever been mocked better than in this comedy masterpiece (and I only hope old Adolf has seen it, too). Mel Brooks' remake is not bad, but the original is simply killer.

Buster Keaton playing the role of the movie projectionist Sherlock Jr. was very entertaining. The story is simple, yet interesting and fun, and the movie comes in at much less than one hour, 44 minutes to be exact.

""Marianne (Noemie Merlant)No art form has struggled more to get the depiction of love just right than film. Portrait of a Lady on Fire gets it almost perfect, and it's Sapphic! All you modest types don't need to worry-writer director Celine Siamma stresses the longing and the dance of love much more than its physicality. Two young women spend most of this beautiful romance just getting to the first dance, and the journey is as exciting and anguishing as it was for us in those early years of exploring.Late 18th century Marianne has been hired to paint young Heloise (Adele Haenel) for her wedding portrait. Not that you can't guess what is going to happen while the first portrait is being painted, but the film languishes long and deep on the glances between these two potential lovers. Those gazes encapsulate the truth of their affections and the high-mindedness of their intentions.Perhaps the business of painting lends the ethereal quality to their love, which is born of the imagination and fleetingly put on canvas forever. It's just that the slow, loving pace of the camera and the conceit lend a mystery (Will they connect?) and a sweetness (how transforming love can be from a scowl to a smile).The cinematography, especially of the rugged cliffs and the sea, is well-aligned with the power and danger of their tender love. Not even mother's (Valeira Golino) affection for her remote daughter pales next to the burgeoning passion of the leads.Portrait of a Lady on Fire fiercely speaks to the fire, conventional or not, that can burn in all of us.

Sehgal offers to defend the girls in a case which almost appears to be a lost cause as the girls are subjected to humiliation and are portrayed as criminals.Amitabh Bachan as Sehgal gives once again a magnificent performance, his gas mask, his blank stares in the courtroom all add up to his fantastic portrayal of the character. Taapsee Pannu gives the best performance of her career, her body language, her mumbling, frightened looks and especially the scene where Sehgal calls her to the stand, make it the most outstanding performance of the year. Kriti Kulhari need s a special mention, especially in the breakdown scene on the stand.Angad Bedi is good as well and actually makes us loath the character, especially in the final cross-examination scene which brings out the double standards the society is into.Screenplay by Ritesh Shah deserves applause and especially the dialogues when Sehgal lists out the safety standards for women/girls.Direction by Aniruddha Roy Chowdhary is classy and does not deviate from the plot with inane sub plots. Right from the word go, he ensures every scenes grips our conscience and tugs us into self- examination.I would not recommend it to anyone who wants to watch flashy item songs, or duets set in Switzerland or out of the world costumes.

Some people might say he is too dense to misunderstand what she is clearly doing, but what I see is Ishida hates himself so much he doesn't believe anyone can love him. The concept of a person actually liking him is so alien it doesn't even comes as a possibility in his head.Another interesting scene is when Ishida is leisurely walking and talking with some people and he asks himself if that is really OK.

The film contains so much dramatic elements and uses them accurately. Furthermore, there are some scenes that are so humorous.
You might see yourself while giggling those scenes.If we talk about cast and performances , we could say the actor,playing Steve, showed us one of the most perfect 
teenager performances who tries to deal with psychological problems
and the mother made us feel the reality of the low class Canadian family.Of course the other leading actress succesfully accompanied them.The way of Xavier Dolan's using musics was great. 
Although the musics were well-known by people by us, we literally effected all of them thanks to Xavier Dolan's wise.
Espically the scene that consisted of the music Exprience by Ludovico Einaudi is the best scene of the film.I just froze. The film has some shortcomings, one of them is scenario.The Script was relatively standart.
It was usual and not able to make us really suprise. But don't worry probably you won't care while watching because of its awesome atmosphere.
Another shortcoming is that The film ,towards in the midlle of it,was dull. It was not only dull but also boring.

275,Haider,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3100044/,"Simply put: Do not see. Or see it. Or see it on TV later. This film is not worthy of such discussion.FOR THE PEOPLE FROM KASHMIR (1). For people from Kashmir, who are looking for some authenticity in the storyline; I am sorry to say that the situations are mostly contrived. The objective is to create pathos for the hero of the film. So, the army is shown as the aggressor in a vacuum and its actions as the instigators for the common man. Many times, the people who fund such propaganda/ political movies have their own agendas and it appears to be very much the case here. There are other objectives and those are from the political leanings of the well-known, separatist-sympathizing, script-writer Basharat Peer. (2). In reality, the anti-terrorist local force, Ikhwan was made more from the people who had been wronged by the terrorists and not from turncoat terrorists. The cause and motivation of these Ikhwanis is not explained as such. The horrors and miseries of the terrorists (many of them being non-Kashmiris from Pakistan and Afghanistan) upon the common man and women, which created Ikhwanis, are not shown. Ikhwanis are shown as mercenaries under the guidance of the Army but Ikhwanis were actually the ones who had earlier been wronged and tortured by monster terrorists and that was their motivation against them. In the film, this Ikhwan-Ul-Muslimeen is deliberately called the Ikhwan-Ul-Mukhbareen. The subtlety in changing the nomenclature should not be lost on you if you are from Kashmir. The History of Kashmir and the names of places in Kashmir are being rewritten with an agenda and the story of the Ikhwan-Ul-Muslimeen seems to have been rewritten with the same agenda. (3). For Kashmiri Hindus, half a million of whom were forced into mass exodus, there is barely any mention and no background is provided about them. The script writer/ movie maker sees that if it was done, you could not develop pathos for any terrorist and Haider eventually is just a terrorist. (4). In the future, if a writer were to actually weave all the subplots (Kashmiri Hindus, What the army was up against, Torture of Locals by the Terrorists, Reasons for the Ikhwan, Role of the rich and the famous and the well off from among the Kashmiri Muslims .) into the narrative, it will be a hell of a story. Haider is not.FOR THE PEOPLE WHO DO NOT HAVE THE BACKGROUND ON KASHMIR (I will stick to facts) (1). There were 2 rows occupied in the entire hall. 1 row was occupied by people of Kashmiri origin and their friends. (2). The people in the row behind the Kashmiris were fidgety after the first 20 minutes of the movie. They would walk out and walk back in. I am not sure how many stayed for the length of the movie. (3). The story is supposed to be adapted from Hamlet. During the portions of the movie that touch the Hamlet storyline, one could only hear guffaws and lack of inclination towards the film. (4). During what should have been the most touching scenes and songs, people kept casually leaving their seats to fetch popcorn, to ease their heads, to take a break (5). After the movie, during the follow-up dinner, I asked some of the non-Kashmiri friends what they thought of the movie. They are open-minded, liberals and what you will call very secular. They did not believe the storyline was as much about Kashmir as it was about Haider and his conflicting/ unclear emotions for his mother and her undeclared, under the covers relationship with his uncle. Unfortunately, this portion of the story and the inter-relationships of the people were not developed well because the script-writer/ filmmaker chose to cover the Kashmir issue way more than required. The movie therefore became a hotchpotch. Even without any background, the non-Kashmiri people in the audience did not believe that the story was anywhere close to the truth. It was just their feeling about the story, even if it had been fact. The problem was that the script-writer/ film-maker tried too hard to thrust their emotion on the audience and that fact had not been lost. Think of a salesman trying too hard to sell to you and your reaction! (6). Their rating for the movie ranged from 1.5 to 2. They said that if they did not know that it was based on Hamlet and if it was an original story, they may have rated it 2.5.CONCLUSION This movie is not a game-changer or a piece of history for anyone. You can safely watch it now, ignore it, watch it for free on TV later, save your time and do something better ..(1). It will not appeal to the young Muslims because they know that it is not the truth. They are up against an incredible amount of propaganda anyway and if they have to be affected, it will be due to that propaganda than due to this movie. (2). The Kashmiri Hindus will know that this is a lop-sided story. They should not worry that general people (other Indians, an international audience  ) will believe in this being a statement of truth. (3). The remaining audience finds the movie to be only moderately entertaining (for art, visuals, drama, suspense  ) but certainly not a reflection of truth.",N/A

Be it in its background score, music, lyrics, playback (especially Rekha Bharadwaj, Sukhwinder Singh, and Arijit Singh), cinematography, or backdrop of Kashmir in 1995, Haider is Haunting, and how! The film will stay with you long after you have left the theater.A. Astounding. Haider is an astoundingly adept adaptation of a classic written almost 415 years ago that can be enjoyed irrespective of your knowledge about the Shakespearean Tragedy - Hamlet. If you don't know Hamlet, great! You do? Even better! I. Incredible. Haider is incredible - in terms of its performances. Be it that of Shahid Kapoor (Haider/Hamlet) who performs a complex role with the kind of award worthy chutzpah that should silence all his detractors once and for all. Or for that matter the the triumvirate of Tabu (Halala/Gertrude) - ethereal, dauntless, and supreme, Kay Kay Menon (Khurram/Claudius) - terrific, resolute, and subtle or Irfan Khan (Rooh/The Ghost of Hamlet's father) - rudimentary and underplayed. Not to be forgotten is Shraddha Kapoor (Aarshi/Ophelia) who pitches in a performance that is 'picture'esque perfect and so full of finesse. And of course the two Salman Khan's who are fans of the superstar and who will surely gain some fans of their own post this film. In fact, every single member of the cast pitches in a perfect performance here, irrespective of the role and duration.D. Daring. Haider is daring in talking about issues that many wouldn't touch with a bargepole and for the way it has juxtaposed a Shakespearean tragedy with a human tragedy - Kashmir. The valley is a character here that finally finds a voice of its own. The interpretations of that voice are truly brilliant.E. Effective. Sometimes experimentation and reinterpretations fail. Not here. With layer upon layer waiting for the audience to be interpreted (for example the touch of Oedipal complex between a mother and son, the growing of guilt of a well meaning lover, the song of the gravediggers, the examples of 'Chutzpah' and its comparison with AFSPA etc). Haider is effective on multiple levels and truly faultless in its execution.R. Rooh (Spirit/Soul). This is a film with an indomitable spirit that filmmakers would die to include in their body of work, and which Vishal Bharadwaj effectively manages to in this lifetime. This film has that which many a masterpiece may sometimes lack - a soul. A terrific triumph encompassing its soulful music, soul stirring performances, and soul warming message.In short - watch Haider - in a theater. For Vishal Bharadwaj, the Director/Composer/Writer. For Shahid, the rising prince. For Tabu the eternal Queen. For Gulzar, the lyricist. For the cinematography by Pankaj Kapoor and the editing by Aarif Sheikh.

277,Logan,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3761642/,"Logan is a movie loosely based on the comic book Old Man Logan where an old retired wolverine takes a cross country trip in search of money and redemption. The comic book was great but I can't say the same for Logan. Many people say they love this movie and the dark rated R format really captures the true essence of the wolverine character which I agree with but as a movie, I just hated it. The movie starts off strong with Wolverine dismantling a Mexican gang and the portrayal of an ill Professor X, but after that all that really happens is a boring back story of X-23, Wolverine yelling at X-23 and Charles, Logan and X-23 flailing their claws killing people, and more of Hugh Jackman yelling. By the time the movie was 2/3 through I couldn't take it anymore I was overwhelmed with boredom and bad acting (mostly from the actress who portrayed Laura/X-23). Overall I just felt let down by the writers. They could've done so much more with the script but they kept it to a long boring Wolverine movie with an unnecessary ambiguous destruction of the X-Men and Mutants with very little Easter eggs on what actually happened. This movie completes the Wolverine trilogy of bad writing and a waste of the Wolverine character and Hugh Jackman.",Logan

Actually, the number of foreign language (ie. other than English and Hindi) films I have watched till date is not even two digit. Still, this movie was mind-blowing!! Wild Tales, is a package of 6 short films which are dark and explosive comedies. All of them has the theme of revenge strikingly common and each one of them is unique and funny in its own way. Each one of them puts forth wild yet realistic situations. The first short story is the shortest of them and is shown pre-credits.Its story of a psych who is not even seen on the screen who makes revenge plan which ends on a bang giving us an overly wild ending. The second film slightly more dark and longer, will make you think before deciding what is right and what is wrong. Third one even longer, is my favorite alongside the fourth. Its violent and brutally hilarious with explosive ending(literally). The fourth one sheds light on realistic situation of a common man troubled by the abusive government system. Another explosion in the climax(again literally)! The fifth slightly less on humor quotient but portrays the human characteristic of greed perfectly. Its darker and has a shocking finale! Th last one, longest and wildest of them all will take you to one of the craziest weddings you have ever seen. Beneath its madness it subtly touches upon the issues of trust and betrayals in human relations.Besides the common notion of revenge and letting oneself lose control in rage, all these tales also focus on how tiniest of our actions can lead to monstrous consequences. The comedy is satirical and dark still its outright hilarious in many scenes. There are many actors (each story has different cast), can't highlight anyone as most of them have done a good job. Director Damian Szifron executes all the ridiculous madness and explosive twists with sheer brilliance leaving dazed at the end of each story. The soundtrack is also quirky and beautiful.The two hours fly away like a breeze. Even if you don't understand the language you will be so invested that after sometime you won't even realize that you are watching a Non- English film. Highly enjoyable!RATING: [4/5]",Wild Tales
280,Wild Tales,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3076504/,"Watched last night at the theater with my girlfriend.It's a compilations of 6 tales, but they don't have the same type of lenght, humor or darkness. Each one is unique.1) Airplane tale: fantastic, hilarating and surrealistic story to open the series.2) Coffee shop tale: shorter, but dark and makes you wonder what's ""freedom"" for some people.3) Road tale: excellent. A really LOT of violence and a little bit of humor makes this one of the best tales in the movie.4) Human limit tale: a man that's having a couple of really bad days explode when he runs out of patiente. Great acting.5) Accident tale: 90% darkness. And the fact that could be a very possible story makes it even darker. Shocking finale.6) Wedding tale: almost impossible to qualify. Hilarious for the most part, but at the end, it will make you wonder to whom you are spending your whole life with.Seeing this compilation in a theater for the price of one, its a damn good deal if you ask me.Go watch it.",N/A
281,Soul,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6409990/,"As a fan of jazz music and Pixar, I was looking forward to seeing this movie. Unfortunately, it lost my interest quickly when the writers got lazy and leaned on the tired old ""body swap"" movie trope. Even worse was the body swap was with an animal. This painfully old routine consumed most of the movie, and by the time they moved past it there was only 10 or 15 minutes left in the movie. I suppose this movie might connect with people running around wondering what their ""purpose"" is in life, but I'm not one of those people, so this movie was a swing and a miss for me. It's still worth a rent, but I don't need to see it again, and it's FAR from the best work that Pixar has done.",N/A
282,Soul,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6401113/,"I can't put into words how close to home this movie hit for me. Not to sound pretentious, but it's more than a movie - it's a life lesson on how to live. It'll teach you that life isn't about careers, goals, passions, or achievements. It's about living, right here in this moment, exactly where you are.The voice acting, animation, soundtrack, writing - all phenomenal. It is officially the greatest Pixar movie ever created in my book. Kids will enjoy it, but this one is for the older crowd. It's for anyone who's ever felt like their life has been a waste. That they've made too many mistakes, that they should have done something else, that it's too late to live. 10/10",Soul
283,Winter Sleep,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3033751/,"This film is undoubtedly not only a master work by Nuri Bilge Ceylan,but also one of the best films created recently by any director regardless of origin and/or name. As with the majority of the people who have already had the chance to view the film, its length - the duration - of almost 3,5 hours makes you fear and skeptic. But with the first scene of the film you loose the sense of time and watch the scenes flow one after another more like real life than a man-made film. As with all Nuri Bilge Ceylan films the graphic quality is excellent. But the real power of this work is the realty, the detail and the warmth which the director has given to the characters. I was a bit surprised when the film came to the end. Was it really 3,5 hours spent on a cinema chair or was it a period of life I lived with Aydin Bey (the main character - a former theater artist)?",N/A
284,Winter Sleep,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3035553/,"I had the chance to see tonight this movie in ""Positif"" (a french, highly rated, cinema review) ""avant Première"". When I made the usual reservation for Positif readers/ subscriber, the reservation told me (and it is listed in the invitation) ""we remind you that this movie lasts 3h and 16 minutes...."". Unusual....I was aware of that, but , as Michel Ciment pointed out, in his introduction, there are 1h 30 minutes movies which seem to last 4 hours....and here, ""on ne voit pas le temps passer"" un-consciously used the title of a song by Jean Ferrat).And, indeed, this is true. Very few ""important"" events happen in the film, but the degradation of the relation between the two main characters takes place little step by little step, and each dialogue is captivating, while the cast (all the cast) is wonderfully playing. Some scenes are surprising by their underneath violence (how a gift turns out to be an insult , and how the outrage is returned, is a flabbergasting sequence) The location in Anatolia, the winter atmosphere, and the remarkable photography adds a piece of charm to the film. At the end, you will remember that it all started by a little stone thrown at a car.... and wonder how you were so much immediately entrapped by the intrigue, so much that it could have lasted as long as the mother and the whore, another lengthy movie, you would not have complained.I do not want to spoil you by describing the plot, but it brings so many reflections about society, aging of a relationship, and a couple, that ... you will want to see it again (which I will certainly do when it is theater released in August). It is an absolute masterpiece, and likely the best film of the decade......(and of course Ceylon best so fat) Go to see it !",N/A
285,PK,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3153126/,"I did not feel offended by any of the things related to god.Everyone has a perspective of looking at a religion there is nothing right or wrong in that.My main concern was the movie as a whole.It felt as if this movie was made to give a Tribute to Aamir Khan.For example Boman Irani is such a great actor but he was only like a prop in the film. There was nothing in the movie which touched by heart as a whole unlike other films of Rajkumar Hirani which kept me thinking about it even after going out of the movie theater.There were some scenes which were irritating and not even funny and were just put to show the whole world of why Aamir khan is such a great actor.The songs were like children's poem.I just want to tell everyone that don't blindly appreciate whatever he does,he is not always right and perfect.If this movie was made with a new comer it surely would have bombed at the box office.The movie didn't have a particular story to keep you edged at the seats,things just kept happening with a few laughs here and there.There are so much better movies made which don't get that appreciation because of the small star cast and low marketing.",N/A

Paresh Rawal and Akshay together created magic as always. Songs are awesome. This movie is the perfect example of how a movie can be good without heroines and item numbers, or action and romance. Paresh Rawal should get national award for this movie,he gave his best. Akshay had a short role but he was best, he was perfect for the role of Krishna. I thought it will be a comedy movie, but after watching i will say the movie got everything, comedy, emotions, love, humanity. This movie is a delight for movie lovers, only few biased haters can dislike this movie. Entry of Akshay Kumar was awesome. Mithun was awesome, loved his character, but Paresh stole the show along with Akshay. Even God will watch this movie and say OH MY GOD what a movie",OMG - Oh My God!

I went into this film with no expectations: --Didn't have a clue what it was about. --Hadn't seen any trailers. --Heard it was a fast paced satirical comedy.Really I felt this movie was pointless. Half way through the film I kept wishing I had gone to see something else. I chuckled a few times, but overall I was bored. It didn't draw me in. I wasn't emotionally involved in the story.Perhaps the fanfare with all the celebrity appearances is what had a particularly nice appeal to others, but I am not impressed with celebrity faces.This is the first time that a film that scored a high IMDb rating has disappointed me. I am puzzled at the disparity.I cannot recommend this film. I thought it was a waste of my time and money.",N/A

This movie is an inspiration, a dream, a walk through a painting and a study of humanity. Ralph Fiennes﻿ is a phenomenon as M. Gustave. his interactions with every cast member and especially newcomer Tony Revolori are fantastic. The later holds his own weight beyond belief and the entire film is an amazing adventure with James Bond style chases, a large murder mystery, the best placed cussing and of course the sensational cinematography.

290,Hacksaw Ridge,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3564540/,"For well over a year now I have been waiting with baited breath to see this movie. I have been a fan of Desmond Doss from a child. Having the privilege of the movie being filmed in my neck of the woods, and even getting to watch some of the scenes being filmed and meeting Mel in the process (ever so briefly), escalated my enthusiasm. When you are that pumped and euphoric, you are usually deflated when the moment finally comes but not this time.Although there were a few aspects of the story that were not as accurate as I would have liked, I realize poetic licence is necessary in some ways to give the real essence of the story. And truth can be so much harder to believe then fiction sometimes. Mel managed to portray the man Doss so very well. Some people are worried this is a religious propaganda/anti-gun movie and I assure you that is not the message of it at all. However there is no getting past the truth of who he was and it is the reason the story is so powerful. He was a man with an unmovable moral compass and it doesn't matter if you don't point yours in the same direction, you can't help but respect him for his courage, bravery, and unwavering faith. The movie starts laying the background of the man that will be the hero of Hacksaw Ridge. It is both witty and endearing. Andrew Garfield nails the roll as the gentle scarecrow of a man. He is a bit gawky and yet charming. His accent is true to the real Desmond, awkward though it is at times. He really draws you into the character and shows you what a fighter he was, non-violent but a fighter just the same. It is well explained what personal experiences have lead him to his discussion to not touch a gun.Hugo Weaving masterfully plays Desmond's alcoholic dad, battling with his demons from WWI, and Rachel Griffiths plays his devoted Christian mother trying to hold them all together. Teresa Palmer plays Dorothy, a nurse that captures Desmond's heart. Sometimes cheesy, but then again in reality it would have been, and it is very amusing to watch. Teresa's Dorothy is a beautiful and charming addition to the movie.Vince Vaughn plays the roll of Drill Sergeant Howell. He adds humour with his name calling, and humiliation of the soldiers, but is a very genuine - just a guy trying to win a war and keep his men alive in the process - kind of guy. Luke Bracey is a fantastic addition to the cast as private Smitty, the more traditional war story soldier.True to his reputation Mel does not hold back with the battle scenes. The devastation is already extensive and the ground strewn with bits of bodies by the time the 77th arrives. The shattering reality of war is dizzying and full of impact, moving so quickly you can barely identify the characters in a whirlwind of panic, pain and death. But amidst the chaos, Desmond Doss's character is revealed to everyone and even his harshest critics realize how wrong they were about him. Watching the story change from having the battalion hate him so much that they try to have him imprisoned, to refusing to go on the battlefield without him, is so moving and inspiring it leaves ""It's A Wonderful Life"" in the carnage on the hill, getting eaten by maggots along with the dead soldiers Desmond sifts through looking for ""one more"" soul to save.",Hacksaw Ridge
291,Hacksaw Ridge,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5475659/,"Another WWII movie but instead of D-Day and the Battle of Dunkirk, it's the Battle of Okinawa in Japan. Which means, new branch of military and new settings. Usually I want war movies to focus on the historical accuracies and action rather than characters, but this movie changed my opinion. It tells the story of Desmond Doss and his life and how he joined the army, that was very interesting and well-acted. The beginning explained our main character and introduced all the others, who are also a good addition. BUT the rest of the movie is awesome. The battle scene is engaging, heart-wrenching, and epic. It is very gruesome, some may not like that, but that's how it actually happened - when you get hit with a bullet, there's going to be blood. The fight portrayed Desmond's goal and his heart to save others, which you have to respect. Not only does this movie provide adrenaline, but also a learning experience.",Hacksaw Ridge

293,Inside Out,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4681254/,"Oh my god. This has to be the most misunderstood Pixar film ever created.
I never realized how much hate this movie had gotten until now, but, reading through the reviews, it just isn't justified.
All of these are parents complaining about it being too intense for young children, but, this film isn't for them. I found that it reached out to a completely new audience, one that Pixar hasn't really touched upon recently, and that is pre-teens and teenagers that suffer from depression.
I am now 14 years old, and this film came out at just the right time for me, when things were taking a turn for the worst. I was going through depression and suicidal thoughts for reasons that I don't want to talk about, around the time in which this film was released. I hadn't seen a disney film in quite a long time, and my little sister really wanted to see this one.
Looking at all the generally positive feedback, I decided to go see it with her.
The opening sequence was possibly one of the best Pixar had done since Wall-E. It was beautiful and cinematic, and just adorable. Riley had some pretty gorgeous facial expressions and detailing for an animation standpoint.
As the film moved on, I started to realize how well this film related to my life, and how well riley related to me as a character. Pixar was very subtle with it, but, managed to develop Riley's character so well, with her barely being on screen.
The characters themselves were shockingly complex, especially sadness and joy. (Joy has a brilliant character design, with blue eyes and blue hair which we'll get to later.)
The main plot basically revolves around a pre-teen going into a state of depression after moving to her new home, away from her friends, her hockey team.
Depression, in my experience, isnt what it says it is. To me, it is a complete lack of any feeling whatsoever. When joy and sadness basically lose control of riley for awhile, this perfectly captured the ""what is going on inside their head"" meaning at the beginning of the film. Joy and sadness are the two most important emotions, and riley didnt have them anymore. A complete lack of emotion, a state of depression.
The rest of the film after that was enjoyable, and a certain character whom I was almost sure going to be a twist villain after that monstrosity that was 'Frozen', turned out to be my personal favorite character in the film. Everyone's had some sort of imaginative personality growing up. I had one.
It helped me cope with stress, I talked to it when I was mad about something, and whenever no one seemed to want to talk to me for whatever the reason, she was always there. That's why Bing Bong's death was just so hard to watch, because of how painfully true it is. I guarantee that 99% of the people on earth have completely forgotten about their imaginative friends growing up. The thing is, he didnt die, he was completely forgotten. When you think about it, it seems so much worse than dying. After that, joy seems to have forgotten about him as well. He isnt mentioned ever again in the movie, but, I'm kinda okay with that. If the movie forgets about him, the audience does as well, which creates an illusion.
Now, let's talk about the ending.
When riley returns home to her worried parents, she seems emotionless. Then I realized something, a slow realization that happened throughout the final scene in the film.
True happiness cannot exist without sadness.
This realization is depicted in one of the most brilliant forms ever, mixed emotions. As riley is growing up and maturing, mixed emotions become apart of her and her core memories. This symbolizes maturity and complexity as you grow up.
This film got me to open up to my parents about my depression and anxiety, and I feel like I have matured just like riley did in the film. Pixar did a brilliant job as depicting our emotions, personalities, and maturity. I love this film so much, and it changed my life.",Inside Out

True to his reputation he has made Barfi with scenes copied from multiple non-Indian movies like Singing in the Rain, Cops, The Notebook, The Adventurer and City Lights. Even film's background score is a copy of Amelie.The actors have copied the original acting pretty well.

Barfi as its name is sweet, full of aroma, delicious and tasty. This in true sense expresses love without any language, caste, creed or color –Selfless with heart; an impeccable cinema worth watching with your beloved, friends and family.Barfi ! Essentially is a chapter of life which has numerable good moments to recall, laugh and to love with. Every character is well placed without being dramatic with excellent music, performances, direction and screenplay.Anurag Basu- the director has done extraordinary work in terms of narrating the story. Like 'Inception' his narrative style takes you in flashback and a flashback within a flashback to narrate a simple story in its most impactful form without creating confusions to audience. Every story has been woven perfectly till climax. Despite the destiny of characters what audience recalls some beautiful moments, cheer, laughs, true love and sacrifice. Each and every prank on screen gives you a bucketful humor and feel good factor whether it's Barfi-cop chase or Barfi's effort to impress Jhilmil and Shruti throughout the movie.Ranbir Kapoor- Well this guy has redefined himself, and the only commercial cinema star of recent time who knows how to act dances and laugh with perfection. Whether it was 'wake up sid', 'Raajneeti'or 'Rockstar' with every movie he has successfully set benchmark for himself but with this movie he has set benchmark even for so called Khans and Roshans. The beauty of his character is despite being deaf and dump in the movie not a single moment you will realize that he even require to speak. His expressions are heartwarming and simply outstanding. Priyanka Chopra – Luckily we have a pool of talented actress these days and Priyanka Chopra with this movie will give a tough challenge to her peers. Her expressions as an autism child are natural and clean. Her feelings for Ranbir as a lady could be easily readable and this is undoubtedly one of the best performances of her career.Ileana D'Cruz – She is one of the best debut of this year. Extremely good looking and charming, she never gives the feeling of a debutant. She does her job perfectly as a narrator and as an actor.Barfi is a way of life, it has potential to make you laugh without getting dirty, it has power to make you cry without getting dramatic and it has energy to teach you love for all without being a documentary. Barfi is perfect in all sense. And for those who could ask why I have written an inch away from Masterpiece ,well being a critique we always expect more than what we got but as soon as the wedding bells rings in the end it was obvious that Barfi has crossed that inch of perfection It's a Masterpiece of Indian Cinema.Thanks & Regards Yours AVA For Complete Review Please VISIT www.thecritiquelab.com Your Views are heartily welcome",Barfi!
296,12 Years a Slave,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2947406/,"Once again Hollywood waves its sanctimonious wand over history with this glossy movie about slavery in the United States. Like a self-righteous teetotaler telling off an alcoholic, it is a sentimental, holier-than-thou piece that challenges you to criticize it or 'you're a racist too'. Following in the footsteps of Django it uses the excuse of history and a worthy theme to justify gratuitous scenes of violence. The film begins in the home of the central character, Solomon Northop, a free black man, who lives a genteel life with his family in New York. The director is clearly eager to get to the gory bits though, and within the first ten minutes Solomon has been kidnapped, enslaved, and the audience is cringing under a close up of his contorted face during a twenty minute whipping scene; the first of many to come. The film continues in this vein, as we follow Solomon's journey through an array of increasingly evil slave-owners. There is a segregation of personality in the film, with most of the black characters being good and moral and the white ones evil. Surely it is as patronizing and insulting to assume personality is dependent on colour as it is politically correct. At least the same cannot be said of gender, the white women are as evil as their male counterparts. However no film about slavery is complete without our token good white guy, and Brad Pitts rises to the occasion, strolling in bearded and ready to play, once again, the hero.One does wonder why Solomon doesn't send a letter under his 'mistress'name on one of his frequent forays to the shop. (Of course, his one attempt to run away is thwarted when after two steps he stumbles on a lynching scene). Perhaps the point the director is trying to make is that Solomon is too broken and scared to do this. He is too proud, however, to pick the cotton quota demanded by the sadistic slave-owner. A necessary contradiction perhaps, as this allows more whipping scenes as he is punished daily.Or why, instead of trying and failing to write a letter with a blunt bamboo stick and watery juice, he doesn't simply use the candle end and stain the paper instead. But it is not a film for the details. Nor the historical overview.It is two hours of increasing brutality, culminating with a horrendous scene where one girl is whipped until her flesh is exposed. Instead of taking one of the many examples of modern day slavery however, which could leave people feeling guilty at inaction, it is set far enough in the past that it allows the audience to do their cinema time, and leave feeling as worthy and sanctimonious as the director.",12 Years a Slave
297,Rush,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2870404/,"i just saw this movie a few days ago at a special advanced screening. as and avid F1 fan myself i loved it. this review might contain Spoiloers depending on how much you want to know about the movie. i don't give many movies a 10/10 but this one got it. overall a superb movie, this is Hollywood's first attempt at telling and showing F1 on the big screen and they nailed it. yes there were a few things they could have done better but not everything is perfect. When you hear those V12 engines start up in the opening scene, you get that Rush of testosterone in the pit of your stomach because of the sheer ferociousness of the sound in the theater. from that point on you are hooked. even if your not an F1 fan that scene will make you want more. every girl i talked to about the movie said they were seeing it for Hemsworth, and after the movie they were in awe about the awesomeness of Formula 1 and what it takes to succeed in the sport. from then on the movie moves at a good pace. as an F1 fan i wish there were a few more race scenes, but it is a Hollywood movie not a documentary so they have to appeal to everyone. the plot and the way the present it was great. i wish they went a little more in depth on Lauda and Hunts backgrounds and also went more in depth on the supporting characters like andretti and regazzoni. but since they didn't do that it lead to a better look at the intense rivalry between lauda and hunt. the small amount of comedy that was in it was very funny, it was somewhat unexpected. the Cinematography is amazing. so many different shots throughout the car and driver as an audience you feel like your right there with them, and as an F1 fan you get all the shots you expect and more. you also get a very good sense of the 1970s era, it feels like a movie made in the 70s with modern quality. some parts look gritty like they used 35mm film.overall i think this is one of, if not the best movie I've ever seen. i saw it 4 days ago and i cant stop thinking and replaying scenes from the movie in my head. i cannot wait for it to come out on blu ray. obviously go see it if your an F1 fan, but even if you aren't i guarantee you will like it. take your girlfriend or sister or mom to go see it and they will enjoy it no matter what. and you definitely wont be bored, it kept me on the edge of my seat the entire movie. not one person left the theater once it started.",Unknown.

One of the most intense films I have watched in a very long time with gripping performances from Hemsworth and Brühl! An extremely clever script from Peter Morgan in which he doesn't pick sides, but instead allows the audience to view these characters in their own light.I am a huge fan of F1 so when viewing a film relating to that sport it would be questionable that there are some anachronisms or minor problems. But no! There was not a single fault with this film, it is the most realistic sports film I have viewed! A film that portrays the rivalry between the British and Austrian world champions and the fateful crash. With some powerful dialogue from Lauda and Hunt.Even if you aren't a fan of F1, the intense action and no-holds adrenaline should keep you entertained from start to finish. With a great sway of emotions from melancholy to ecstatic! This film deserves the acclaimed reviews it has been receiving.",Rush
299,Ford v Ferrari,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5834225/,"I was really looking forward to watching this film, but I was disappointed about how Mangold directed it, some overacting, and a too melodramatic script.First, the director expects us to believe that two race car drivers will drive side-by-side giving each other the evil eye while careening down the straight at 210 miles per hour. Better yet, in some early scenes they shout at each other in their open-top race cars, as if they could be heard over the sound of the engines. Mangold also channels Ben-Hur's chariot race, with cars nudging each other sideways. During the Le Mans race, he cuts away multiple times to driver Miles' wife and child watching the event on TV. I'm sorry, but no network then or now would televise a 24-hour race in its entirety. I can almost hear the laughter of anyone in the racing industry who watched all the absurdities (I am sure they would have a longer list than this one).Next, the director did not rein in the outrageous overacting by Christian Bale as Miles. Add in the demonic glowering of Letts as Henry Ford and you have a cartoon, not a well-conceived treatment of an historical event for American racing. As is par for the course with these testosterone-driven movies, the female characters are destined to be background cheerleaders for their men; in this one, there's only one of them.Equal blame then to the scriptwriters, who came up with a predictable plot line in the best (or worst?) tradition of American melodrama. We have the bad guys (Ford and Beebe) and the good guys (Shelby and Miles), and everyone else is window dressing. Not a shred of nuance here, which should be an insult to the moviegoer, but I guess the bar has been set pretty low for decades now.The racing scenes themselves are well-filmed, with lots of low-angle shots that create even more of a feel of being there. A lot of viewers want explosions, and you get more than your fair share of those here -- maybe too many to be realistic.It's unfortunate that in a film of almost epic length you don't get a good exposition of the friendship of Miles and Shelby. Unless I'm wrong, and it just consisted of a lot of bantering and occasional meaningful looks.",N/A

301,Spotlight,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3432443/,"This movie undid something inside of me. It's that part of you that holds on to hope that people can be good, that there is hope for humanity. I knew the basics of it when I went to watch it: that it is about investigative reporters looking into a story of abuse in the catholic church. And it uncovered so much more than just that. Honestly, this movie should be seen by anyone who seeks the true face of the world. We don't live in a pink bubble of happiness. F*cked up things happen to people all the time; worst thing is when it happens to the innocent. The little ones who can't protect themselves. When they are robbed of their faith and their hope and their future. Sitting in the film theatre on the last row, I was brought to tears as in front of me a long list of places where victims spoke out was scrolling. I was both shocked and mad. I felt sorry that people can fail so miserably. ""Mike Rezendes: They knew and they let it happen! It could've been you, it could've been me, it could've been any of us."" Indeed. When we witness darkness and we shut up and we don't do anything about it, that's when we fail. A poet once wrote, ""You can join the millions talking in the dark. Or you can stand up and scream light, out into the night."" So choose to stand up. In your profession choose to eradicate the oblivion of evil. This movie is a masterpiece. From the dedication of the actors to their roles, to the script, the director and the cinematography. The score? Fantastic. Howard Shore did it again!",N/A
302,Kahaani,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2578264/,"Leave your bag of popcorn outside the theater. You would honestly not have the time to crunch it as you watch this fantastic film with bated breath. For Kahaani is a ride so thrilling, your mind would be tripping with a million possibilities, even as your tongue invariably ends up either tied, or hanging in the air with anticipation.Kahaani is essentially the story of a heavily pregnant London based Tamil woman's search for her missing Bengali husband in Kolkata, underplayed exuberantly by Vidya Balan. The supporting cast comprises a helpful cop Parambrata, a selfish detective - Siddiqui, an eccentric life insurance agent - Saswata, and a bhadralok Police officer - Khwaraj, and last but not the least, of a 300+ year old city - Kolkata seeped in the throes of celebrating the mother of all festivals - Durga Puja.The film unfolds like the pages of a gripping novel by Agatha Christie or Sherlock Holmes and is shot like that of an Alfred Hitchcock or a Satyajit Ray. Using real people, places, and situations to underline the nuances of the story is a task that's handled brilliantly by director Sujoy Ghosh (also the co writer) whose recent claim to shame - an abysmal Aladdin, or a horrendous Home Delivery shall soon be forgotten just as Madhur Bhandarkar's debut dud was.In addition to the sterling performances and the plot is the terrific technical support. Be it Amitabh Bacchan's rendition of Tagore's 'Ekla Chalo Re', the background songs (mostly of RD Burman), playing innocently as the characters travel the length and breadth of the city, the costumes by Sabyasachi, the 'just right and yet dramatic' background score, the non-condescending cinematography that captures the city as if it were a character, and the supreme screenplay with a spattering of real Bengali, act as just the right spices to turn this into a delicious dish, that's both exotic as well as commonplace.Watch this film to experience something so satiating, you would surely ask for more (a rare for a thriller!). I give this a 10/10 not just because this is one of the best thrillers ever made in India, but definitely one of the best films to have ever come out of Bollywood. Kudos to the whole team! Trust me! Ami Sotthi Bolcchi!P.S: Please do not discuss the story with anyone else, unless they have watched this film.",Kahaani
303,Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2459275/,"""Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara"" (ZNMD) is a complex, honest, and thoroughly refreshing story about friendship, about love, about choices, about ... well ... the journey of Life (lit. 'zindagi'). Writer-Director Zoya Akhtar takes three characters we might think we've seen before ... but deftly makes them original, fresh, and unexpectedly engaging. Her intelligent script perfectly balances the very real, even painful, personal transformation of each character with moments of joy, wit, charm, and humour.No one's Life Journey is ever quite what one plans!Our protagonists? Three best friends since childhood: Arjun (Hrithik Roshan), now an investment broker in London; Imraan (Farhan Akhtar), an advertising copywriter in Delhi; and Kabir (Abhay Deol), a construction architect in Mumbai. Ten years after college Kabir's imminent wedding impels 'The Three Musketeers -- all for one, and one for all!' -- to finally embark on the many-times-deferred adventure challenge they'd always planned.ZNMD explores whether three grown men can survive a 3-week road trip together *and* still remain friends *and* still be the same people.Think you've heard similar, before? Guess again! Ms Akhtar elevates the basic 'road movie' premise into something rare and sublime: brilliant character-driven comedy never cheap but often laugh-out-loud funny, and so true to life and people each of us actually know that it genuinely moves the heart as well as the mind and funny-bone. As each ZNMD character in turn challenges his own fear, whatever personal demon that has been holding back his life, it becomes our victory, too.See ZNMD and discover: *your* life may change, too!Such strong story and plot would be lost, without great acting.Farhan Akhtar just gets better and better, as an actor, every time out of the gate. Already one of India's best young directors, his deceptively brash but sensitive and layered acting in ZNMD is quiet excellence ... and deliciously funny.Abhay Deol is not exciting, but I like his potential. A good foil for the other two.However the real revelation in ZNMD is, most surprisingly, he whom we might have *thought* most familiar. Hrithik Roshan we see so often in heavy dramatic and/or demanding multi-part roles -- because, let's face it, he's that rare actor who CAN do them, and do them brilliantly well -- that it's easy to forget just how plain damn funny and versatile he can be. Casting one of the world's more notorious compulsive workaholics as, well, a compulsive workaholic? Absolute genius!On the distaff side ... Katrina Kaif. Wow! Where did this performance come from? She's always been beautiful, of course, but in ZNMD for the first time she shows subtlety and depth as an actress. Easily, her very best work to date.Cannot finish without special mention of the fantastic music by Shankar Ehsaan Loy, long my favourite Hindi film composers. Their ZNMD soundtrack perfectly backdrops the film's emotional journey. Irresistibly hummable music spans the full range of moods and emotions, much like our three main characters: everything from amusingly lighthearted ('Senorita', sung by Mssrs Roshan, Akhtar, & Deol) to cool and modern ('Ik Junoon -- Paint It Red') to reflective ('Der Lagi Lakin') and even unabashedly romantic ('Khaabon Ke Parinday').But the rocking 'Dil Dhadakne Do' seems to capture the very Joy of Living ... and that is the ultimate spirit of Zoya Akhtar's ZNMD.Perfect summer movie! 10/10Best film I've seen yet from anywhere in the world, thus far in 2011.",Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara

305,Prisoners,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2991996/,"Never written a review but Prisoners got my juices flowing – in a bad way.The film is way too long, a lot of unnecessary shots, no real emotion, no saving the cat moment (Blake Snyder) on Hugh Jackman's part and one of the most significant fatal flaws in my mind – absolutely no humour, not a pinch. It's a gritty film (and I get it), but please give me a break! An experienced writer would be able to lighten up the mood and that is a must from time to time.Now, the inconsistencies, silly red herrings and just plain stupidity: Why would the child killer go to confess to a priest when his faith dwindled after his son died and they waged war against God? The priest confirmed that the killer was ""bragging"" – so what is exactly the point of going to the priest? Does not sound like a confession issue to me. Fail Why didn't they get the priest to do a photofit and connect the dots that way? If you kill a man you sure remember at least something of him? Why didn't the maverick detective think about the old Auntie's husband going missing all those years ago and perhaps make some sort of connection? Nah, it's not good for the plot. Fail The same maverick detective-solved-all-the-cases finds everything out by chance – by chance he sees the cable sticking out from behind a cupboard which (surprise, surprise!) is hiding a secret entrance to a secret basement and the priest never even thought of getting rid of the body. Then, by chance again, the maverick detective shoves all the stuff on the floor from his desk and voila! – A clue again! Fail Why did Hugh Jackman's character need to beat the retarded Alex – when the genius detective interviewed him, it seemed the phobia of human touch did the job? Plus, Keller never got anything out of Alex although Alex's capable – when the plot requires – to utter a completely coherent and revealing sentence. Also, everybody would of course believe the retard but not the father trying to find his missing child. Where was surveillance? Oh, my next point – the whole police force consists of the genius detective, his superior with an office, a couple of administrative guys and a forensic team of 2 – get outta here! The genius detective does not only seem to have no training but lacking in common sense as well – why would you not close the first snake box and let the snakes get out whilst you're opening other boxes? This is just idiotic. Fail Everybody seem to be talking in riddles – the girl that escaped utters ""you were there"", everybody seem to hear it, see Keller run out like mad, but for the plot purposes, nobody reacts. Instead of questioning the girl (who, we've just witnessed, can actually speak!), they just stand around in a friendly circle. Fail Keller goes to the auntie's house knowing full well that she's a serial killer and (one in such extreme situation would gather) – very dangerous. He TURNS HIS BACK to her and mutters a threat. For what I know, she could have knocked him out with a frying pan at that point. Fail The evil Auntie, weirdly, seems to be repeating every command twice – open the drawer x 2, get in the car x 2, everything's repeated twice – are the writers short of words? What's going on? Fail Oh, and a note to the director – try cutting the scenes down or eliminate the ones with people just walking down the hospital corridors – may add urgency to the pace and people would not doze off whilst watching a 2.5 hour film the story of which does not warrant this length.The list goes on. Yawn... Enough now, otherwise I may write into the early hours of the morning.",Prisoners

But apart from a physical prison, a prisoner can also be trapped mentally, either by his own doing or by someone else. This movie that starts off pretty light gets very heavy. And it is carried by its actors. Gyllenhalls characters might seem odd and out of place at the beginning, even like a cardboard cutout. But he does have more to do as the movie progresses.Still front row seat is Hugh Jackman. And while some might argue that a female should have a bigger role in this, you only have so much time to tell a story. And this is perfectly told and cut together. It might not fit your description of entertainment (and I don't think the filmmaker would love it described as such), but the movie is really great. If you like dramas in general you should be cherishing this .... and you will.We have a few grey areas that we visit and the ending did not satisfy everyone (I know from friends).

I will start by saying this movie was absolutely batsh** insane. It was filled right to the brim with continuous over the top bloody ridiculous action sequences that keep you on the edge of the seat and just amazed at what Is happening on screen. Now this film doesn't have much of a plot at all but seriously you're not going into this film for an intense plot, this is a film that almost didn't even need one at all. The one thing I was worried about going in was whether I needed to have seen the previous films to understand this one and thankfully you don't, the story is independent of the previous film which was really helpful. The characters were all awesome and it did an amazing job to introduce them all almost instantly and get right into the action. Max (Tom Hardy? and Furiosa (Charlize Theron) were were great and extremely likable characters. Even the villain who I will just call Sweet Tooth was so great, he wasn't anything too special but was a great threat throughout the film. I just absolutely loved this movie, intense action from start to finish and didn't slow down at all, that made it ridiculously fun to watch. The great characters and the performances are awesome on screen and we're always interesting to watch. If there was ever a Twisted Metal movie, this is what it would be. Nothing really let the film down and everything really worked, such a great time and the best cinema experience this year so far. - 10",Mad Max Fury Road
308,A Wednesday,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3192820/,"What makes a good movie? I say a good movie should have good acting, good sound production, good camera work, good plot, be well directed and so on. What makes a ""top 250 grade"" movie? Wonderful acting, amazing sound production, astonishing camera work, really unique plot and to be directed by someone who has outstanding talent. And this movie isn't even good. Why? The only thing it has is some kind of a ""message"". Well, having a message is not enough. It doesn't have anything a movie should have. Acting is just awful, especially the fighting scenes. Music sounds out of place and cartoon punching sounds are just ridiculous. Camera work is strange. Plot is average, or slightly above. And i won't even say anything about the director.First of all, this movie looks like a cheap TV drama. And i know it has low budget. But making shots of a cat getting thrown from around the corner or ridiculous fighting scenes with cartoon sounds has nothing to do with money, it's a matter of taste. Those who made the movie just don't have it.Next, CGI. Yes, it does have it. But it would be much better if it didn't. Because showing the audience some strange black silhouettes unnaturally flying out of an explosion doesn't make the movie look more believable, it makes it laughable. Well, CGI costs money. Congratulations to the creators of the movie - they found the worst way to waste it. Because if you don't have enough money to do good special effects, you shouldn't probably do them at all.Also, introducing a superhero-cop character in a movie that is supposed to be an intense moderately realistic thriller with some drama mixed in wasn't such a good idea.So, as a result we have a movie that looks bad, sounds bad and feels bad. However, it's kinda useful - without it i would've never known what a really awful movie actually is. This one makes a great reference.I've never actually written a review before. And what made me do it is the fact that this movie somehow made it to the top 250. Believe me, it doesn't belong there. Just doesn't. It's a shame that some site users do not want to rate movies according to their quality, but rather use the flaws of the rating system to push movies from their country to the top just because they want to.",N/A

310,Gran Torino,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1989795/,"Now I understand why Clint Eastwood took over the directorial reins for Changeling from Ron Howard. (Howard dropped Changeling in order to make Frost/Nixon, instead.) Eastwood did an excellent job on Changeling, with a genuine feel for the dark subject matter, and guided Angelina Jolie to one of the best performances of her career, to date, significantly expanding her dramatic range. The film that Eastwood really wanted to make this year, GRAN TORINO, was greenlit by that other deal. This is crucial, since all of the Hmong cast are first-time actors, who were hand picked by Eastwood from cold auditions. Any film with a cast of unknowns can be a tough sell in Hollywood, even with Eastwood helming and starring. (The list of award winning Eastwood films that almost didn't get made is long and very distinguished.) In casting, Eastwood didn't want ""thespians."" He wanted an honest exactness of performance. While I really like and respect Changeling, I found GT to be far more satisfying. GT is probably *not* the best film of this year, but it is one damn fine entertainment and it fully holds its own in this rich season of films that are up for awards contention. GT is an humorous and compelling meditation on the themes of ubiquitous bigotry, culture clash, political refugee immigration/resettlement (and, by way of that, US foreign policy) and Old School, Doing the Right Thing (vs today's more commonplace ""situational"" ethics). All of this rolled into two, parallel, coming of age stories, served on platters heaping with very real slices of life. The messages crack like jabs, with the sting of truth, and are never too preachy. (Eastwood is one of the few directors who respects the intelligence of his audience. He surprises film goers, always, without ever talking down.) One coming of age story involves a neighbor kid, Tao Vang Lor (played by Bee Vang), a dirt-poor son of divorced Hmong immigrants (Vietnam war political refugees). Tao lives with his mother, sister and grandmother, next door to Walt Kowalski (Eastwood). Walt insists upon calling Tao, ""Toad"" (initially, with some good reason). Tao's sister, Sue, (a scene stealing Ahney Her), is spontaneously outgoing and engaging with Walt, and confides to Walt that Tao is growing up without any proper male role models in his life. In fact, Tao is in the midst of confronting the grim prospects of either being recruited into his bad-seed cousin's gang or becoming a permanent victim of said 'bangers. The less obvious coming of age story revolves around Walt Kowalski, a recently widowed Korean War veteran. Walt's Polish ancestry seems to serve no purpose other than to establish him as ""ethnic"" white, living in a dog-eared neighborhood of ongoing immigration stories. Walt is a curmudgeon, who lacks basic ""people skills"" with even his own family, let alone the world around him. But he has managed his way though life, fine enough, up to the opening of the film's story. Just about every review I've read about GT describes Eastwood's Kowalski as a ""racist Korean War veteran,"" which misses one of the major points raised in the film -- that bigotry in the US is deeply ingrained in every niche of society. None of us is innocent or absolved of anything in this regard and the film is very frank about this point. Initially, this serves as nothing more than a source for shock humor, but Eastwood finds a way to subvert this into a message of tough-love hope. The gang life incursions into the story are very true to life. Gangs are always either recruiting new cannon fodder or marking new victims. If parents seeing this film had no clue about this, they ought to start finding ways to open up ongoing lines of discussion with their kids about what's really happening, day-to-day, at school, in the playground and elsewhere. Most of the time, kids like Tao, just internalize all of these pressures, hoping that they won't be picked on, and otherwise feeling powerless. None of us should ever kid ourselves about *all* kids, not just some kids, being ""at risk."" (As for the non-white, poly-ethnicity of Kowalski's part of town, the disbelievers of the authenticity of that have only been exposed to the rarefied 'hoods of mainstream Hollywood. I can name any number of mid-to-small cities/towns where the exact mix and flavors in GT are very real. You don't have to live in a 'hood to pass through and/or stake out an occasional corner on which to hang. The Latino and black ""presence"" in the film never implied that they lived in that neighborhood, although they were obviously trolling for victims. Perps who don't intend to be caught *rarely* hunt in their own backyards.) Walt knows that he's dead set in his ways, not all of them ""bad,"" but not most of them ""good."" Beyond the confines of his own property line, Walt may be a little more effective than Tao, out in the real world, but, he too is, in many ways, powerless to change the way most things are. Nevertheless, in getting to know Tao, Sue and the extended Hmong community to which the Lors belong, Walt discovers that his Fort Apache ways don't work anymore. Walt realizes that he has yet to finally come of age, too. (Some will call this ""atonement."" I call it ""growing up, again, at 78."" Both are spot on.) This film will make you laugh. It may even make you cry. But it might also make you think about some stuff you thought you were long ago done with thinking about. People at the screening I attended were so startled at the end that there was a significant moment of silence before applause finally broke out. GT is another lovely present from Clint Eastwood. Don't miss it.",Gran Torino

312,Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2454856/,"I quite luckily got the chance to see this at an early screening on July 7th.First impressions of the film? Brilliant.Director David Yates, who also directed the 5th, 6th and 7th films is back to direct the final. This pleases me because these 3 films are my personal favourites out of the 7 that have come out so far so I think it's fair to say that I was expecting big things from this. I'm very pleased to say that he's pulled it off ending the series in a fast paced, well written final act.The film (in case you're wondering) picks up straight after where Part 1 ended, Voldemort (Ralph Finnes) has the most powerful wand in his possession and he's finally ready to succeed in what he tried to do over 15 years ago. He finally has the power to kill Harry Potter. I won't go into much more detail in what happens as most people will have read the book and I don't want to drop spoilers! Harry (Daniel Radcliffe), Ron (Rupert Grint) and Hermione (Emma Watson) need to seek out and destroy Voldemort's remaining Horcruxes. This is the only way that will give them a chance of stopping He Who Must Not Be Named.Their final journey takes them to places we may not have seen recently or remembered, places such as Gringotts Bank in Diagon Alley and Hogsmeade. Along the way they encounter a variety of creatures, both friend and foe from dragons to spiders, death eaters to old friends and of course, the Dark Lord himself. Will Voldemort Succeed? Or will good trump evil? For those who haven't read the book this is your chance to find out.What I especially love about this film and Part 1 is the direction in which they've taken, adding more cheesy lines and (for example in Part 1) that dance sequence. I feel that these small touches bring the films closer to our hearts and help us to connect with the film a lot more. Sure they leave out a lot of information that the books provide but that's the same with all film adaptations! They've got the main story down and where they've deviated from the book it has been for the best. Not everything written down on paper will translate into visually appealing footage.Part 1 to me also felt unfinished (well it was only half the book I suppose!), I mean in the way that it was long and never seemed to climax. Sure at the end of Part 1 Voldemort gets the want he so badly seeks for and leaves then the films ends on a giant cliffhanger. Part 2 definitely adds the rest of that epicness that so many other films have towards the end. It's full of action! I definitely believe that both Part 1 and 2 are best viewed with a short as possible gap in between them. Otherwise it's like watching the first disc from one of the extended editions of The Lord of the Rings and not watching the second disc for another 6 months!This paragraph is about the visuals and 3D. Skip to the final paragraph for final thoughts.Visually the film is stunning from an effects point of view. From the trailer alone you can see that this film has quite a lot of action in it, crumbling buildings, hundreds of spells and lots of fire. Everything looks great, from the wand duals to the dragons it all is fantastic. Also this time around it is being showed in 3D and is the first (and (probably) last!) potter film to be shown in this way. Now I was very sceptical about this, especially since they announced that the films (originally both parts) would be converted from 2D to 3D instead of being natively filmed in 3D. I believe that what they should have done was what they did with Part 1, scrap the 3D. I'm going to say that it's not great, at times it's pretty good, but never great. For the most part it's okay. I'm going to compare it with the last blockbuster film to come out in 3D, Transformers: Dark of the Moon. The 3D effect is not even close to looking as good as what that film (shot in 3D) had. So I'm going to tell you now, 2D is the best dimension to watch this film in. Having said that if you still want to (or have to) see it in 3D by all means do, the 3D doesn't take away anything from the film, but it doesn't add much.I will end by saying that I definitely recommend this film for everyone, especially Potter fans. The ending that many thought could easily be done wrongly has been done right. Then when you think of Part 1 and 2 as the same film I believe that they are easily the best Potter films. This truly is a fitting ending for the boy who lived.",N/A

Being able to watch the end of Harry Potter on the big screen really brought the impact of just how much this series has touched not only my life, but the lives of everyone around me.

The job of the professionals who prepares the dead for their last contact with the family (wake) and their passage to eternity (cremation). In the film, the characters who perform this job, teach the spectator a true ritual of respect and affection with the dead. ""Respect and affection with the dead"": feelings that the modern life tries to banish from its practices. In the modern world, the dead are inconvenient and dispatched quickly in funerals where the majority of those who are present, entertain themselves with parallel talks, instead of focusing on the reason why they are there.2. The nobility and grandeur of this job that, in the film, is not associated with any religion, and is directly associated with dealing with human beings. This nobility and grandeur reflects also on to the dead, in the sense that it reminds us that the dead deserve our respect and affection, because a new stage of our relationship with them is starting.3.The way Daigo grows, as he learns this job, and overcomes (i)the social stigma that society imposes upon the contact with the dead and, also, the people who have contact with the dead, as well as (ii) his personal repulsion with repulsive material aspects of death (odors, rot, etc.)4. The way Daigo grows, as he incorporates the nobility and grandeur of the job he was forced to do because of the circumstances (he was jobless because the orchestra where he played cello was dismissed). And, when his wife discovers in what consists his job, and tries to force him to quit, he has grown so much that he chooses to keep the job instead to yield to his wife menaces.5. The way Daigo grows and which leads him back to play the cello and celebrate life more than ever, playing outdoors and playing at home as he used to do when he was a boy.6. The way Daigo wife grows when she has the opportunity to look close to the job of her husband, and begins to admire him and love him more. Wife who have the opportunity to convince Daigo to take care of his dead father, when Daigo runs away when he gets aware of his father death.

The way Daigo grows when he encounter again the love for his father and forgive him for having abandoned the family, while he prepares his old man for the burial.8. How death can be seen as part of life process, when it causes some people to become aware of how much love they missed, and how much they have been loved without being aware of it.All this happens because Daigo goes back to his hometown, a small town. That is, the return to his origins helps to renew the ties with the traditions and helps the character to put himself together again.I'm omitting many precious details that appear throughout the film. These details must be seen personally, because the film was made with great sensitivity and expertise, and deserves to be seen.Roland.",Departures
315,Hachi: A Dog's Tale,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2158592/,"I first knew about ""Hachiko: A Dog's Story"" because of Sarah Roemer, my favorite actress. When I read more about this movie and found out that Richard Gere and Joan Allen were in the cast too, I was really excited.I saw the movie on 29 Setember at ""Festival do Rio de Janeiro"" and I loved it! It's really powerful and touching. I loved how they showed the dog's vision in black & white.The only thing that I didn't like at all was that the characters seems to ""never take flight"". I know Parker (Richard Gere) and the dog Hachiko are the main characters, but I think that the other characters could have been explored a bit more. But I do understand why it wasn't done.If you are a dog person, you will definitely love this movie! It's a sad, beautiful story that touches everyone's heart! A must-see.",Hachiko: A Dog's Story

317,Mary and Max,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2052708/,"There's a constant stream of animated films these days, but mostly they're either glossy Hollywood product (Pixar/Dreamworks), or Japanese anime. For adults wanting something different we have to wait for the likes of The Nightmare Before Christmas, Waltz With Bashir, Persepolis, or Aardman's films to turn up. Mary & Max is one of these films that comes as a complete departure from all the others, both in visual and storytelling style, and sticks in the mind because of it. I won't repeat the plot here, so I'll just mention a few pros and cons. The cons are obvious. Some people will be put off by the almost constant narration (which took me a while to get used to), the rather numerous calamities (a lot more than you'd expect if you thought this was just a kids film), and the sadness within some of these people's stories. It's actually a little surprising that the film got made without the people financing it demanding a script that was more tailored to appeal to a wider audience. What we get is something that feels a whole lot more personal than the higher profile animated films. It feels personal, and therefore real, and the explanation is that it was written from life by a director who has a real feeling and sympathy for people who don't quite fit into the world, and feel alienated or are misunderstood by others. Mary was partly inspired by the director's own childhood (and there's a little bit of Toni Collette's Muriel Heslop thrown in I suspect), and Max is also based on a real person he's been pen friends with (but so far has never met in person). The way the film handles his Asperger's Syndrome just feels different to how you'd normally see such an issue handled on screen. There's a constant stream of humour (ironic, black, childish), and I really enjoyed the small perfect touches on growing up in an Australian suburb in the 70's and 80's, and the depiction of grey New York, as it appears to the easily frightened Max. The animation is constantly a joy to watch, and I highly recommend seeing it on the big screen where it can be properly appreciated in all it's hand-made glory.",Mary & Max
318,Mary and Max,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2114576/,"It's hard to describe just how excellent this film is. The story is great, both very funny and touching. The art-design and animation are a delight, thoughtful, very rich in details, and very consistent in style. The music is great. The storyline and direction... I can't find a bad word to say, except that the story drags a little half- way through, but then picks itself up again toward the end. Truly, a must-see. If you like adult animation, this is definitely for you. I agree with those comparing it to Aardman films, Waltz with Bashir and Persepolis, but this movie's animation is so professional, that only Aardman truly compares.",N/A
319,How to Train Your Dragon,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2230455/,"I am not at all interested in dragons and all such fantasy creatures. I don't like children movies with all their stupid messages. I saw this movie rather just to pass the time than to watch it for its sake. And Whoa! I was drawn in this river in first 5 minutes. And what a experience it has been! Right from the start as the narrator describes his world, you are immediately there. You feel yourself in the characters place. The movie does that for you. This is very uncommon movie and it has set a milestone for 3D, not because of its technical aspects, but because of the Depth this movie has. This movie is as much for a 7 year old as it is for an old man who has seen a lot of life. This movie will entertain each viewer in his own way. This is a masterpiece! This movie isn't what it sounds on the surface. It has layers of meanings attached to it. Look at just the title: How to train your Dragon!. If you see it carefully you will notice that there is more to it than meets the eye. Watch the movie and you will know what i mean. This movie cleverly comments on Human Fear, War, Friendship, prejudices, courage, Love. ........................... Don't miss this movie or you will miss one of the few periods when you really LIVE. Note: Just remember to carry your heart with you when you see this movie. It will fill your heart with nothing but what should truly belong there. 10/10.",How to Train Your Dragon

I may of had the most fun that I've ever had in Cinema watching How to Train Your Dragon.The script is really good and is has a lot of dramatic depth. This movie is for everyone. Adults and Kids will enjoy it equally and will love it at the end. This movie will probably become a series like Shrek.

321,Into the Wild,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1839355/,"Besides the cinematography and music I completely hated Into The Wild. The following is a list that expresses this hatred toward the glorification of Chris Mccandless, a mentally unstable kid who runs away from home. Spoilers. 1. Chris teaches us that when you have problems at home, just run away. 2. Apparently he and his sister are the only kids to ever have to deal with fighting parents. 3. How could he just leave his sister? He obviously loved her and took care of her. But no, he leaves her there with his psycho parents. Never writes her or anything. 4. He was too scared to stand up to his father. He just ran and hid when his dad hit his mother. 5. He turned down a brand new car from his parents to keep a piece of crap. 6. ""I don't need money."" Umm lets see he needed money for a kayak. He worked for Vince Vaughn and Burger King for money so he could make it to Alaska. Just a little hypocritical there. 7. Apparently being a free-spirit makes you an expert kayaker. 8. Everyone he meets is the absolutely nicest person you could ever meet. 9. The male hippie's lines are laughably bad. 10. Male hippie tells Chris that he and female hippie are not doing good. Chris talks to male hippie for about 20 seconds and then goes swimming with female hippie. Male and female hippie go back to being completely in love. 11. The amount of times the word ""Alaska"" is uttered is just annoying. 12. Without the abandoned school bus he would have made it about a week. 13. Living in an abandoned school bus is not exactly living off the land, forgetting society. He slept on a friggin cot, had a place for a fire, and had sufficient shelter. 14. Man. Sitting there by yourself in an abandoned bus in the freezing cold. That's living man. Wow. 15. He thought he could make it in the Alaskan wilderness with no map. 16. His story is basically now a tale of what not to do with your life. 17. The only real thing he learned from his adventure is that ""Happiness is only real when shared."" Umm ya think? There's probably other ridiculous stuff from this movie that I forgot about. This movie makes this kid into some kind of hero when the only thing he accomplished was committing suicide.",Into The Wild
322,Into the Wild,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1727974/,"I've never posted a comment regarding a movie but feel compelled to after attending a screening of Into The Wild at the Toronto Film Festival last night. I won't speak to story here as it's covered in the other comments.This is a movie of real beauty. It made me cry. I felt moved in a way that happens very rarely. It was an inspiration.The feelings it evoked were all based on the power of the acting and the writing. The words were real and human. The relationships seemed real and human. This may not seem like a great feat - but I consider it a true rarity. It didn't feel calculated and artificial, like so many movies (read: Crash - but I'm not here to bash that...). It was very organic, natural and (I can't say it enough) just beautiful. Cripes, it's making me sound like a hippie, for heaven's sake. This for me was Penn's best work since Indian Runner.What it reminded me of...Terence Malik - Herzog? - in a strange way Cassavettes? - Hal Ashby (more Coming Home than Harold & Maude...) - even a bit of Ken LoachRuby in Paradise - Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore - Five Easy Pieces - Easy Rider... but when I list those it's not because of plot similarities (though there are some) or style (although I think you can definitely see the influence of some great films) - it's again because of the heart of it. I heard a few people at the screening comment that the film was ""too long"" but I don't agree. I think exploring a journey of this magnitude required visiting all of the people he touched and taking the time to see the land.Hal Holbrook was just perfect, as was the cast as a whole, and I think Emile Hirsch is really going places - he was fantastic and he owned the role. Eddie Vedder's music worked perfectly as well - not distracting or quirky - just a part of the whole.The film received a standing ovation and quite a few tears were shed. Magic.",Into The Wild
323,No Country for Old Men,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1779466/,"I have a plea out on the message boards for someone to please explain this movie to me. I love movies and I am not one of those who insist on only being hand fed obvious characters and plots. I enjoy movies that make you think and use symbolism. But I honestly did not understand this film. Im not saying its horrible but I will say I don't think it deserves the ratings it is getting. I personally rated it a 1 because I feel compelled to balance out the absurd over ratings it is getting.What I saw was two men fighting over the same two million dollars. One who is somewhat good and obviously poor and the other who is this maniac psycho killer. Im not even sure its his money, how he knows about it or why he even wants it. None of that was clarified.The good guy is running with the money the bad guy is chasing him the sheriff seems like he is supposed to be chasing them but doesn't really want to and would rather be some sort of hillbilly philosopher about the whole thing.Then the good guy suddenly dies. The bad guy escapes death by the skin of his teeth AGAIN the money disappears and the sheriff retires but not becoming so philosophical that the whole movie just ends right there at his dinner table with him rambling on about some dreams he had.Again I would love to figure out this movie.I am a 40 year old movie buff Academy Award trivia expert I own over 700 movies I've been a member here for 6 years And I have a college degree.Maybe I ate too many milk duds or something but it went right over my head.If you are looking for a Donnie Darko, Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind MUST SEE A SECOND OR THIRD TIME TO FULLY UNDERSTAND kind of movie then go for it!If you think you are going to see a Titanic, The Green Mile or Silence Of the Lambs kind of movie where the plot unfolds at a normal pace and doesn't make you search for answers and meaning then don't go see this thing. Again, not a bad movie. Great acting, cinematography, pace.... the works... just incredibly difficult to understand after the first half.In fact the first half is very good, suspenseful.. second half does not fulfill.

324,No Country for Old Men,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4078243/,"The message of this film is that there is no symmetry to life. What goes around does not come around.

325,Lage Raho Munna Bhai,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1465525/,"""Lage Raho Munnabhai"" , the second film in the Munnabhai series and perhaps the most eagerly awaited movie of the year at least for the people who like meaningful cinema.This one was supposed to be a sequel but it has a story of its own and its refreshingly original and no connection with the first movie except the Munnabhai and circuit and their gang. I saw the movie and was completely spellbound by it.I was glued to the screen for the entire duration and enjoyed every bit of bit.To call this movie a comedy would be wrong this one is a mix bag you've got comedy, romance , emotions (and yes lots of them) and a beautiful script to tag along.The entire cast is simply lovable and all have acted their part to the book. Sanjay Dutt excels in the role of Munna hes is well complemented by ever smiling Arshad Warsi as circuit who surprisingly shows his softer side in some well acted emotional scenes. Vidya Balan looks fresh and acts her part well. Boman Irani as The Punjabi builder is first rate,people get to see the various shades of his character.The supporting cast of elderly persons is also good. Dia Mirza provides glamor to the film in a brief but sweet role. Jimmy Shergill is likable in the scenes where he gets footage.But the real star of the movie is ""RajKumar Hirani"" , yes the director of the movie. he has told the story in a very unique manner which appeals to the masses.I wont go into the details as it will spoil the fun but this man is a class apart, he has handled each and every scene with perfection be it comedy , emotional or drama brilliantly.Music is perhaps the only weak point of this film. Though the songs blend well with the story but no songs stands out to be a chart buster. The picturisation of the songs is beautiful and visually appealing.On the whole ""lage raho munnabhai"" is an excellent movie not to be missed. The movie will tickle your funny bone as well as bring tears to your eyes in some situations. Its unique way of story telling will find praises not only from the masses but from the critics as well. the movie has a surprise package in the character of ""mahatma Gandhi"" and the actor who's played the part suits the role wellI can't wait for another outing with Munna&Circuit but good things come at a price. The price here is Another Wait Till Then patience rakho ""MAAMOO"".",Lage Raho Munnabhai
326,Lage Raho Munna Bhai,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1464333/,"I saw Lage Raho Munnabhai last night and it's still in my head today. I always go to watch sequels with a bit of trepidation but Mr. Hirani soon eased my fears with a wonderfully thought out comedy that is funny and has a message which he puts across without being preachy. Most of the same cast back again with only Sanjay Dutt and Arshad Warsi reprising their roles and playing the same characters again. This movie cannot be considered as a sequel as it is more of an episode in Munnabhai's life not unlike James Bond films or Charlie Chaplin's tramp.Sanjay Dutt is just perfect as Munnabhai... i cannot imagine anyone else playing this role. It was said that Munnabhai was first offered to Shahrukh Khan, while i do like the King Khan i feel he would have gone overboard with this role. Sanju baba plays with a lot of conviction and i believe his true character and honesty shine throughout the film. He handles the comedic and emotional scenes with ease.... so naturally. Good rapport with the Bapu character.Arshad Warsi a.k.a Sarkeshwar a.k.a Circuit was also brilliant ...excellent chemistry with sanju and had some nice sequences. I liked him since the time he appeared in Tere Mere Sapne... and is coming into his own as a Bollywood star in his own right.Vidya Balan was bright and chirpy... great teeth! Only disappointment was that Boman Irani did not have the same impact as he did with Dr. Astana but still a great performance. He makes the audience like and empathise with him even though he could be considered the villain of the piece.Direction was excellent, song sequences were handled beautifully with most of the songs being situational all well shot especially 'Samjho ho hi gaya' & 'Pal Pal Har pal'. This movie just proves that Bollywood movies can be just as good and entertaining as Hollywood while still giving us all the masala.We should all follow ""Gandhigiri"" but first let's support this great movie by praising it and WATCH IT IN THE CINEMA!!!!!!!!!!!!10/10.",Lage Raho Munnabhai
327,Hotel Rwanda,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1019851/,"This is a terrific movie. The performances are spectacular, particularly Don Cheadle. He deserves an Oscar for his portrayal of the hotel manager. The movie itself is much more important than just entertainment value. Most people aren't familiar with the horrific events in Rwanda in the 1990's, but they should be. We tend to think that genocide is something from the past that just doesn't happen in today's ""civil"" modern world. The true story behind this movie proves just the opposite. With all the focus on the Holocaust in World War II and all the talk about ""never letting it happen again,"" the world as a whole failed the people of Rwanda miserably just a few years ago. Everyone should see this movie, and learn a thing or two.",Hotel Rwanda
328,Hotel Rwanda,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0981300/,"Anything I say in this review is probably redundant, because there isn't a single negative review in all the comments so far here, and I agree wholeheartedly with what has been said by other reviewers.Nevertheless Hotel Rwanda is that rare kind of movie experience that doesn't easily relinquish its hold on the audience just because the credits have rolled. Watching with a friend, after ten minutes we had to pause the film because we decided we would be better served if we were more informed about what the basic facts of the conflict in Rwanda were. So to my shame, we had to read on the internet about what really happened, before we could continue. I say shame because we should have known, both of us were of an age when it happened to have taken more of an interest in world politics.The film is beautifully understated, eschewing sentimentality in favour of raw emotion and letting the story tell itself. The acting was flawless - Don Cheadle's breathtaking performance being a particular standout - and the direction didn't falter, despite all the potential pitfalls of dramatising a recent and horrific conflict. The scenes which were hardest to watch in terms of tension and violence were often suffused with humour and hope.It's difficult sometimes to separate the significance of the true story, from the artistry of the product, and often I get impatient with 'worthy' movies scoring big at Oscar time because it seems as though important stories ought to be rewarded, whether or not they make good films. However, I can't recall being so profoundly moved by a film since I saw The Grey Zone, and I hope Hotel Rwanda gets all the plaudits it deserves.",Hotel Rwanda
329,Tae Guk Gi: The Brotherhood of War,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1626777/,"In 1950, in South Korea, the shoe-shiner Jin-tae Lee (Dong-Kun Jang) and his eighteen years old student brother Jin-seok Lee (Bin Won) form a poor but happy family with their mother (Yeong-ran Lee), Jin-tae's fiancé Young-shin Kim (Eun-ju Lee) and her young sisters. Jin-tae and his mother are tough workers, who sacrifice themselves to send Jin-seok to the university. When North Korea invades the South, the family escapes to a relative's house in the country, but along their journey, Jin-seok is forced to join the army to fight in the front, and Jin-tae enlists too to protect his young brother. The commander promises Jin-tae that if he gets a medal he would release his brother, and Jin-tae becomes the braver soldier in the company. Along the bloody war between brothers, the relationship of Jin-seok with his older brother deteriorates leading to a dramatic and tragic end.I have just watched one of the most spectacular movies of war of the cinema industry, if not the best. The stunning and overwhelming ""Taegukgi Hwinalrimyeo"" is impressive and the brilliant direction of Je-gyu Kang and his crew is among the most perfect I have ever seen, with realistic and gore battles and fights. The cinematography is amazing and the camera work in most of the moments seems to be a documentary, so realistic it is. The sad and dramatic story shakes the emotions of the viewer, with another stupid war, and worst, between brothers. Probably this is the best and most visceral anti-war movie ever made. Dong-Kun Jang and Bin Won are amazing and I felt deeply sorrow with the fate of the character performed by the gorgeous Eun-ju Lee. How can this movie be not nominated to the Oscar? My vote is ten.Title (Brazil): ""A Irmandade da Guerra"" (""The Brotherhood of the War"")",Taegukgi: The Brotherhood of War
330,Tae Guk Gi: The Brotherhood of War,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0968317/,"Nations do not fight wars. Citizens fight them, and these citizens are honorable men and women who serve their country willingly or, as history shows, by decree of a desperate government.As a result, patriotism has become the unlikeliest casualty. Once welcomed in the trenches of battle, patriotism has lost its limbs, fought back from life support, and suffered shell shock. Once easily recognized, patriotism has become a bit of a chimera, an ideal more easily attached to definable characteristics than it is any single soldier. However, in the bitter end, patriotism is defined by the actions of these individuals who serve; it is rewarded by the nations who sponsor this service; and, more often than not, it is measured in hardships endured.Such is the complex, ever-changing battleground of writer/director Kang Je-Gyu's 'Taegukgi: The Brotherhood of War.'In 1950's Seoul, Jin-Seok (Won Bin) and his older brother Jin-Tae (Jang Dong-gun) are enjoying a strong family life of perfect happiness. Suddenly, they find their lives turned upside down as soldiers of the South Korean government seize them  all men aged 18 to 30 are taken  and they are forced to take up arms  despite their lack of training  against the approaching North Koreans. On one brutal battlefield after another, the bonds of family are put to increasingly demanding tests as Jin-Tae  originally driven by his responsibility to protect his younger brother  continues to further exhaust his physical and emotional prowess despite the protests of Jin-Seok. He learns that he is a good soldier, one with a talent for inspiring others as well as an unanticipated thirst for killing the enemy. Eventually, these two brothers  once bound by a love for family  find themselves at odds within this new brotherhood of war, and the pressures to prove one another continue to exact heavier and heavier tolls as the war escalates. As circumstances evolve, the brothers inevitably find themselves on opposite sides of a losing conflict  but can either find a path to redemption or reconciliation that can save both of them?There are many elements of 'Taegukgi' that elevate the film from the status of standard war film to a message of hope set against the backdrop of war. The film's scope is grand, dealing with the far more intimate themes of family, brotherhood, and personal responsibility when Director Kang Je-Gyu could have easily opted for banging the drum of nationalism. At its core, 'Taegukgi' is the story of two brothers, a strikingly poignant analogy for the entire North Korea / South Korea dilemma. While the battlefield choreography is as frenetic as it is harrowing, it never takes the film's center: this picture is founded on relationships  the human perspective to the world outside  and it never falters. Instead of focusing on history, Kang Je-Gyu crafts every scene to highlight the thoughts, actions, and emotions of the participants of history, and, for that, 'Taegukgi' deserves countless accolades.Much like exploring the heart of darkness as depicted in American classics as Francis Ford Coppola's 'Apocalypse Now' and Oliver Stone's 'Platoon,' Kang Je-Gyu forces Jin-tae to explore his own budding evil, and this journey is not without its own relative scars. Once a man has crossed over and embraced wartime madness, can he ever truly find a way out? Arguably, if 'Taegukgi' suffers from any setback, it is that perhaps Jin-tae goes too far for an audience to accept his madness: believing his brother to have been killed by North Koreans, Jin-tae turns traitor once he is captured and seeks to wipe out every soldier serving South Korea. While the story offers the motivation for so drastic a change, it's hard to believe that the man who once fought so valiantly against the spread of Communism would suddenly choose to embrace it.Still, it's a small diversion  but it's necessary to bring the aspect of brotherhood full circle, to have these two unique men face their darkest hour, and to make one final statement on the role that family inevitably plays in every man's life.Recently, thanks to the worldwide success of 'Taegukgi' and 1999's blockbuster 'Shiri,' Director Kang Je-Gyu has signed an agreement with Hollywood's own powerhouse, CAA, to produce his next film in America. Only time will tell whether or not this agreement will afford some of the 'Korean sensibility' to American films, but certainly having one of South Korea's premier directors breaking into the Hollywood film system is a tremendous advantage for fans of international film.Only the passage of time will earn 'Taegukgi' its rightful spot alongside the other great films dealing with the consequences of war.",Taegukgi: The Brotherhood of War
331,Before Sunset,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1736712/,"This is a review of ""Before Sunrise"", ""Before Sunset"" and ""Before Midnight"", three films by Richard Linklater.Released in 1995, ""Before Sunrise"" finds Ethan Hawke playing Jesse, a young American who's travelling across Europe. On his way to Vienna he meets Celine (Julie Delpy), a young woman on her way to Paris. From the moment out duo lock eyes, they're drawn to each other. They share a meal, savouring the conversation more than the food, and when they arrive in Vienna, Jesse persuades Celine to keep him company wandering the streets. Thus begins an unforgettable screen romance.Like most of Linklater's films, ""Sunrise"" is both dialogue heavy and boils down to a series of discussions or ruminations on life. Our duo talk incessantly, touching upon subjects which range from language and reincarnation to sexuality and religion. Some of it is cringe-worthy, but for the most part Linklater's dialogue rings true. His banter is casual, natural, lacking in artifice, and we at times feel like voyeurs, eavesdropping on the sort of ""unimportant"" dialogue that most films shy away from. But the film is sexy as well. Celine and Jesse crackle with electricity, and Linklater pays great attention to subtle shifts in body language. There's one scene where Jesse restrains himself from brushing away a stray lock of Celine's hair, and another wonderful moment in a music listening booth where our duo nervously avoid eye contact. Elsewhere the film indulges in numerous long takes, Linklater's gliding camera making the most of some gorgeous European locales, as he dips in and out of romantic alcoves and cosy spaces. Linklater's long steadicam takes lend ""Sunrise"" an ""energy"" and intimacy that many of his other films lack.Released in 2004, Linklater's ""Before Sunset"" is a sequel to 1995's ""Sunrise"". Equally good, the film joins Celine and Jesse almost a decade later. Speaking to both the mind and the heart, it finds our duo still obsessed with the night they first met, fell in love, and then somehow forgot to exchange contact details. This time around Jesse is in Paris to promote his new novel (he's now a writer), and it is Celine who tracks him down. Our couple then embark on an 80 minute chat, the fact that Jesse must leave on an afternoon flight tightening like a hang-man's noose around their conversations. The film then ends with a sequence which packs an emotional wallop.Hawke and Delpy so easily re-inhabit these characters, you have to wonder how much they're based on themselves. Simultaneously dopey and intelligent, their conversations cycle through hilarity, pain and misery. On the downside, both characters are obviously the product of an artist; Celine and Jesse are a couple of unashamed hipsters.Once again Linklater utilises long, uninterrupted takes, his gliding camera capturing vast chunks of banter and beautiful Parisian architecture. A few gentle flashbacks give glimpses of the original film, but we don't really need them. This story stands on its own as a second chance to change fate. And as is typical of Linklater, cinema's chief slacker-philosopher (at least since the death of Hal Ashby), Linklater has his film abstract several profound human truths, placing them all in a series of dialogue driven vignettes. In a way, Jesse and Celine become everyone and everything, and at times represent more than themselves.Released in 2013, ""Before Mightnight"" finds Jesse and Celine as a committed couple. It's been eight years since we last saw them, and they now live in Europe with twin girls of their own. Unsurprisingly, the puppy-love of the first two films has given way to middle-aged weariness, parental responsibility, regret and pragmatism. The film is somber, even pessimistic, and Linklater cleverly introduces several other characters who represent life and love at different stages, most notably an elderly writer and a young couple who conjure up images of Jesse and Celine's own romance almost two decades ago. If ""Sunset"" and ""Sunrise"" evoked Eric Rohmer, or Bresson's ""Four Nights of a Dreamer"", ""Midnight"" recalls Abbas Kiarostami and Rossellini's ""Journey to Italy"". Again dialogue heavy, and again reliant on long takes, the film is colder, harder and more caustic than its predecessors. Our couple now view everything with scepticism, and seem to exude a mood of grim acceptance and resignation. Most of the film's conversation revolve around death, career disappointment, transience, the world ending or technology's negative influences; the rants of a dying generation. At one point Celine even paints a dour image of the future, in which society devolves into ""masturbation and death"". In another, Jesse insists that man is ""99 percent automated"" and even goes so far as to denounce the concept of self-hood. Other conversations mock the way men measure accomplishments, and of course male obsessions with the phallus. Elsewhere an elderly man explains that couples are ""never one person, always two"". Unlike its predecessors, ""Midnight's"" sceptical of romance and even soul-mates. After a wholly contrived argument in a hotel room, a forced segment designed to set up another sequel, our duo then seem to patch up their problems, though you nevertheless suspect that this relationship has reached its end. Expect a possible fourth film to be about loneliness or separation.Early in ""Midnight"", Jesse reveals to us characters in his new book. One character lives in an unending, wondrous present (the very behaviour that brought Jesse and Celine together so many years ago), whilst another views all experiences as being ""second hand"". Jesse later talks about being ""lost in perception"" and introduces us to the ""patron saint of eyesight"", moments which exemplify Celie and Jesse's own anxieties. Both fantasise about different, better futures, and both are unsure of their partner's role in this desired world.9/10 – Whilst as good as its predecessor, ""Sunset"" may rub people the wrong way. The idea of successful, self-reflexive, middle class hipsters incessantly yapping, will prove irksome to many.","Before Sunrise, Before Sunset, Before Midnight"
332,Before Sunset,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0964639/,"There are four scenes that I will treasure forever:1) The ferry ride, and the subtle ways you can tell they're both heartbroken, lonely, frustrated and angry. The way she discusses the ""little details"" that compose a person, and what she missed most in him. ""Like I remember the way your beard has a bit of red it in, and how the sun was making it glow that...that morning right before you left.""2) The scene in the van, where they finally unburden themselves. One of the most emotionally raw and honest interplays I've seen on celluloid. The way she reaches out to touch him, but holds back at the last second. Much different in tone from the way Hawke reached out to brush her hair aside in the first film.3) Celine's song. So simple yet so endearing. The way her voice fades to a whisper as she sings, ""My heart will be yours until I die.""4) The ending, which is in all ways **PERFECT**. The slow fade, the utter charm of her Nina Simone impression, the ambiguity, and the wonderful look in his eyes as his youth, hope and happiness come rushing back to him while watching Celine dancing and singing (foreshadowed in the opening scene). This is, perhaps, one of the ten best endings in the cinema.Hawke and Delpy are sublime, of course. This film requires incredibly subtle acting, and these are Oscar worthy performances that will not be recognized because they are not showy. Much of this film, like life, is acted with the eyes. Witness how Hawke stares at Delpy as she discusses her failed relationships on the ferry, or the sadness and longing in Delpy's eyes as she sings her love song. As in the first film, the chemistry between them is indelible. My candidate for best on-screen couple ever.This film is better than the first, because it provides a more unique perspective. In Sunset, we see the sobering effects of age and disappointment etched in their faces and clouding their lives. There is more at stake here, for they are nine years older, have made their share of mistakes, feel imprisoned by responsibilities, and must confront their shortcomings and problems. It's comforting to believe that hope and love will prevail in their case.",Before Sunset

With the exception of, perhaps, SE7EN, serial-killer movie has never been this good. The story (about real-life killings of 10 women in Korea during the 1986-1991) is compelling enough, but the actors (Song Kang-ho cuts you deep even when he's silent, and his big-city partner offers emotional jolts at the end), the director (effectively plays some scenes in docu-style approach), the cinematography (a shadow creeps out in the paddy field will give you, well, creeps. big one.), and the music (haunting) are welcome bonuses.One scene that impresses me most is the crime-scene midnight chase between a suspect, 2 local detectives, and a big-city detective (who doesn't know his local partners are there watching him). Humorously intense, or intensely humorous, whichever serves you well.The only regret is I saw this one on DVD, while I believe a movie this big (in many senses) deserves to be seen in theaters.

Fresh, invigorating, romantic, bizarre even!They don't make films like this in the West - and more's the pity but hence the freshness. The three lead actors are gorgeous - so it hardly matters that they must be the oldest students in town. The cinematography is beautiful - especially in the Australian sequences. The song and dance routines are as welcome as they are surprising.As with all Hindi films, it is pure melodrama of course. The ability to suspend one's disbelief is a necessity. But that aside, it has all the attributes of a good old fashioned Hollywood romance. Boy meets girl, boy loses girl... etc., times three.The core theme of friendship is a delight - as are the subtle homo-erotic overtones of Akash and Sid's relationship. Intended or not, I wouldn't have minded if they'd ended up together - but this is Bollywood remember!All in all, fantastic fun which I plan to watch again and again. Highly recommended.",N/A

Just compare this film with Yaadein, from Bollywood veteran Subash Ghai.Where as Yaadein is probably one of the worst things to come out of a camera, DCH is one the best. It's just one of those films you'll find hard not to like, basically because it's exactly how the medium of Indian films should be used.Rather than just cut and paste a song into the film, the filmmakers have done very well to make each song feel wanted, visually interesting, and they never drag. The result is a near 3hr film that just flies by. Comedy, Drama, Great Songs, love stories that work, and some truly excellent casting. Everyone carries the film, and the 3 guys, Safi, Akshay and Aamir are too good together!Hopefully this film is a wake up call to the rest of Bollywood, who seem to be obsessed with unoriginality. Technically DCH can easily stand up against anything from the West. Editing, Directing, Cinematography, lighting, set design -- everything just works so well.Sometimes Bollywood can produce some truly great films, and this is most definately one of them!!

339,Kill Bill: Vol. 1,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0774211/,"It has been six years since we have seen a movie from one of the world's most talked about directors, Quentin Tarantino, but the wait for me, has been worth the while. Tarantino can now add the martial arts masterpiece 'Kill Bill' to his resume, a film that left me speechless after I had seen it.  It certainly is one intense, hateful movie, containing some of the greatest sword fighting sequences ever filmed in a movie. Tarantino has made KB with class, precision and close intense attention to every detail. But, what else should we expect from a movie freak, like Quentin Tarantino?An entire wedding party is slaughtered during a dress rehearsal in a rural chapel: the pregnant woman in the blood-splattered wedding dress is Black Mamba, better known as 'The Bride'. The assassin, Bill, and his circle known as 'The Vipers' leave 'TB' for dead, however she was merely comatose. Four years later, 'TB' suddenly awakes from her coma, ferociously focused on one mission, to seek revenge on her former master. One by one, she will kill the various assassins. She is saving Bill for last.I am not sure where I want to start with my review of Kill Bill. I love parts of it, but then find other parts to be extremely difficult to watch. Quentin Tarantino has written and directed another powerful piece of cinema, in a way that only he could. This time we see more violence, the action and the result of that violence, with it being a bit over-powering in the end. But without the violence, KB would have not been the movie it was.This time Tarantino has not focussed on the dialogue in this movie, when it came to writing its script, more he wanted to show what the characters he had created, and why they were in the position they were in. For me I can appreciate both aspects of what Tarantino shows, as he can express himself either visually or with dialogue.The other part I like about KB is the way Tarantino dedicated the movie to certain aspects of cinema history. To quote Quentin he said Kill Bill is 'my yakuza movie, my samurai movie, my spaghetti western movie', and it was quite clear for me how passionate Tarantino was in showing these parts. However it was also so much more, with one of the great sections of the movie being presented in Japanese animation. I also believe that there was a clear reference to black and white movies and silent movies, as KB had these sections a few times. I also feel that Tarantino is in some way trying to show his appreciation to Pulp Fiction, the movie that made him successful, via KB. If this is true, I do not feel it is gloating, rather I give Tarantino great praise, because some movie makers ignore the movies that give them success, but not here.While 'KB' has some interesting characters, none are what I would call 'likeable'. 'The Bride', aka Black Mamba (Uma Thurman) is a girl totally driven by the desire to get revenge. Thurman really suits her part well, as she not only looks attractive, but is really believable as this American martial arts tough girl. Helping 'TB' on her quest is Samuri sword expert Hattori Hanzo (Sonny Chiba). This character brings a very oriental feel to the movie, something I liked. The bickering with his assistant was fun to see being played out.'The Deadly Viper Assassination Squad' are the cruel callous people who inflict horrific harm on 'TB'. Bill (David Carradine) is their leader, a person we only hear and see in hand gestures, which is reminiscent of Marsellus Wallace in Pulp Fiction. Bill still has a very strong presence in the film, even though we never see him. Under Bill are killers like O-Ren Ishii, aka Cottonmouth (Lucy Liu), whose introduction, via the Japanese Animation, was great. Under Cottonmouth is her personal assistant, lawyer and translator, Sofie Fatale (Julie Dreyfus), who was present at the slaughtering of 'TB'. When 'TB' sees Sofie once again, she is pretty bitter about what Sofie let have happen to her. What we hear has happened to Sofie at the hands of 'TB', is truly unbelievable.Another of Cottonmouth's women is a little girl, Go Go Yubari (Chiaki Kuriyama), who is more deadly than she looks. Her school girl sound and look is very interesting, while her confrontation with 'TB' highly entertaining. Then there is the evil nurse, Elle Driver, aka Californian Mountain Snake (Daryl Hannah), who shows very little emotion towards 'TB', other than hate. Vernita Green (Vivica A Fox) is another woman that 'TB' has on her hit list. Her demise was highly entertaining to say the least, again reminiscent of Pulp Fiction.All the scenes with fighting in KB are a highlight for me, especially the sword fighting, as they are so fun and intense, with the last hour of the movie purely exhausting, with the final showdown between 'TB' and Cottonmouth & co. being terrific. The middle section of film was also great, as it tells the majority of the KB Vol. 1 story, although parts are pretty disturbing.Kill Bill is another film by Quentin Tarantino, where I have to say it was 'exceptionally well made'. There is a scene in Volume 1, which reminded me of 'Matrix Reloaded'. Now I have heard that Tarantino hates the Matrix franchise, and you can see what he is making a stand against, film's laden with SFX. KB is 'not guilty' of being that. The violence is very graphic in KB, but at certain times the violence was 'laughable', as it seemed to look deliberately fake. But perhaps I am wrong? Volume 1 ended at a good point, setting up the conclusion, Volume 2 beautifully. So Kill Bill: Volume 2, get here, A.S.A.P.CMRS gives 'Kill Bill: Volume 1': 4.5 (Very Good - Brilliant Film)",Kill Bill: Volume 1

Never, did I ever come out of a theater after seeing a movie smile for the rest of the night. The movie just completely blew me away. I knew it was going to be good, but I had no clue what was in store for me when I saw it opening night. This movie is a work of pure genius. The animation is just beautiful, acting is awesome, the music fit everything that was going on. I could go on and on with this list, but I think I'll stop there. What I liked mostly about this movie was that it didn't lack anything at all. There was just the right amount of comedy, drama, suspense/action, and even romance.

341,Catch Me If You Can,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0765516/,"An all-around good movie worth seeing.  The plot is pretty basic: Quick-thinking kid from a broken family that he loved.  He spent the next few years playing a pilot, doctor, and lawyer.  Think ""Pretender"" (the television series) but based on real events.  The surprise was the unique relationship of the FBI agent and the con-man in their cat-and-mouse chase they have over the years around the globe.  An engaging film that you are curious to see how it ends. That goes even for my girlfriend who stayed awake for the entire movie because she was captivated by it [Note: she has slept thru ""Gladiator"", ""Shakespeare in Love"", ""Elizabeth"", and the ""Fellowship of the Ring"" because they (apparently) didn't peak her interest].

342,Catch Me If You Can,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0765374/,"From the opening credits design we get in the mood of this very entertaining film. They create the tone for what will follow. Steven Spielberg is in rare form directing this movie that doesn't have a dull moment.Mr. Spielberg has found a perfect actor to fill the shoes of the con man with the perfect casting of Leonardo DiCaprio. It's very easy to see why all the women fall prey of this charmer. He was a fast talker and a slick operator. He exudes charisma to fill another couple of movies.
It's a welcome sight to have Mr. DiCaprio working in a vehicle that shows his talent as Frank Abagnale, a man of many faces. He plays a game of hide-and-seek throughout the movie with Hanratty, the FBI agent that is in his trail. Tom Hanks shows great assurance and gusto with this character. Of course, the DiCaprio magnetism dominates the action with the many ironic twists and the miraculous and narrow escapes he pulls with an aplomb that's bewildering to the Feds, who are on his tail all the time.The minor roles are equally important. Christopher Walken as the father starts out as the prototype of the con man, but he's too decent to do wrong; his business fails eventually. His marriage to Natalie Baye, the fine French actress, ends in divorce because obviously she hates being married to a loser.The action doesn't stop for one moment. This film is great fun to watch with the winning combination Mr. Spielberg assured hand gives us this time out. Mr. Spielberg can thank the genial Mr. DiCaprio who responds obviously to his direction and makes this con man endearing even when he is committing crimes.",Catch Me If You Can
343,Amores Perros,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2326195/,"A dense, overtly sophisticated, but never really wise, script by Mr. Arriaga gets the famed ""Inarritu treatment"" – otherwise known as ""fanciful free fall in the arms of obsessive despair and educated repulsion"". The ""problem"" with Amores Perros (also with 21 Grams and Babel) is you just can't ignore it. Or, to put it better, you'd feel some kind of terminal guilt (appropriately) if you did. The three intertwining stories revolve ambitiously and high-poweredly around the theme of fatalism, on ""love's a bitch"" (more or less the title), on ""brother against brother"" religious motifs, on Kieslowski, Poe, a bit of Mexican-period Bunuel, and on a to-the-point requiem on Viva La Revolucion. In short however, this is a salute to the idea of ""God laughing when people make plans"". (To be honest, God laughs when people make movies about God). In any case, the only one laughing in Inarritu's humorless universe could be God, though I don't really see why He'd be so pleased in seeing his creatures miserable as hell (). Obviously this is a vengeful divine presence overlooking the production of Amores Perros, a production stately (while recalling Mr. Babenko's 1981 Pixote) and, occasionally, inspiringly unpleasant. Undoubtedly a masterpiece for those who get their ideological kicks in non-American speaking filmmaking, an intriguing torture for the rest.",Amores Perros

I confess the sin of prejudice concerning Mexican cinema, this being maybe the second Mexican film I have ever seen, but here my sins are punished. This is the work of a director of big talent. Hopefully, he will not be spoiled by the success.
Three different stories in today's Mexico mix with very few common elements. The characters belong to different social categories, and nothing connects them at first sight, excepting the feeling of un-happiness, and - yes - dogs. Dogs play an important role in all three stories. One more warning - there is a lot of cruelty including dog fights - this film is certainly not for sensitive animal lovers. Directing is excellent, the stories are human and complex and despite their melodramatic or sometimes tragic outcome, they still leave you with a shade of hope - maybe because the humanity that the author uses to create his characters. There are so many memorable scenes, that I would commit another sin to pick any and describe it here - just rent, or go to watch this movie in the theater - it is worth all 150 or so minutes you will spend. 9/10 on my personal scale.",N/A
345,"Monsters, Inc.",https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0954846/,"I thought Billy Crystal and John Goodman were great. I like them anyway, but I can't imagine anyone else in their roles. John Goodman comes across as a warm, fuzzy teddy bear type in so many of his roles, and this time he was actually drawn that way. Crystal and Goodman were great together, even when their characters showed signs of not getting along. And Boo sounded so natural, so childlike. There's no way an adult could have done her lines the way they were executed.And the writing was so intelligent, this movie was not just for kids. There were a lot of clever jokes that kids might not get. Still, the warm and fuzzy qualities of so many of the monsters make this a perfect choice for kids as well as adults, and I really don't get why ABC couldn't give this a TV-G rating. It may have been a little violent or scary at times, but never all that intense. Kids see worse on Saturday morning.",N/A
346,Neon Genesis Evangelion: The End of Evangelion,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0594066/,"WARNING: This is nothing but SPOILERS!!!!Anno had planned to made this untoppable ending from the very beginning, not because fans sent him death threats. In episode 25 of the series there are scences that forshadow exactly how misato and ritsko die in EoE. He had planned this from the beginning. why? b/c Anno is a genius.I actually liked the ending to the series more than the one in EoE. The series was a benevolent, happy, empowering ending, and EoE was just a depressing, hopeless and insane ending. What made the series ending so good was that it was a self-help guide to how to take control of your life and love yourself for who you are. Anno wanted to teach his audience that they could love themselves and be happy about their life no matter what. He gives step by step instructions and walks the audience through their own mind. That is why the last scence of the entire series ends with ""Thanks to all the Children."" The children are the audience that sat down and viewed the entire series and now understand how to be happy with their lives. Anno is helping people that might be depressed in their life to see that you are the one in control of your life and you can be happy if you will yourself to. Anno boosted the self-esteem and empowered every person who understood the ending to the series and thats why he thanks the ""children"" for attending his self-help video seminar. It was a terrific public service to teach people how to love themselves, and I personally think he should recieve the noble peace prize or at least some kind of award for all the lives he changed.EoE was very different than the series ending. There were similar psychological elements laced throughout the movie but on the whole the tone and atmosphere and underlining messages were completely different. Anno must have been going through some disturbing times in his life when he made this movie. Its so different from the series that it is hard to believe that it came from the same person. and that is what makes Anno a genius.

347,Neon Genesis Evangelion: The End of Evangelion,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0594015/,"Finally, after long last, I have managed to watch the End of Evangelion. It was worth any wait.Those not familiar with the series will have no clue what's happening, so you should at least watch the first 24 episodes. End of Eva takes place as an alternative to the last 25 and 26th episodes. It may sound confusing, but trust me, if you just sit back and enjoy the ride, everything makes sense...even if not right away.The final Angel has been killed. The 'hero' of the story, Shinji Ikari, now regrets doing it, as he was the only person who seemed to ever like him for who he was. But there is no time to lament on personal demons, as the shadowy puppet masters in SEELE have set the final stage of their plan in motion.The dreaded Third Impact.What's even more surprising is that the entire series shows one, giant plan to actually SPEED ALONG the Third Impact, as it could lead Humanity to it's next evolutionary step.And so, Humanity will now rely on a weak savior who may or may not lead humanity to it's oblivion. A hero who must first fight his own inner dragons, and come to terms with life, and love from himself and from others.As a response to the public outcry that the last 2 episodes were someone strange and had no ""Mecha Combat"", the End of Eva has enough of both combat, AND philosophical scenes. A strange, but wonderful mix.
Asuka's fight against 9 Evas is absolutely the most STUNNING visual fight sequence I have ever seen. The energy and awesome scope of the battle is impossible to convey through words alone.Though Asuka's character is as flawed as Shinji's, she finds redemption in this movie. Again, an amazing testimony of the Human Spirit and our will to live.The emotional impact of this movie is also quite amazing. It brings reality and the mind to question, and asks us if being individuals is better than being a whole. Is life just a dream, and can we ever be Gods of our own Reality? Those who have watched the last two episodes of the series will see instances where the movie and episodes combine and compliment each other.Finally, the animation is wonderful. Creepy and breathtaking. Powerfully deep, but also amazing on the physical conflict level as well. This movie is EASILY a match for Akira and is an instant classic.
Watch it with an open mind, and be prepared to be stunned. Be ready to question yourself. Be ready to use your mind in ways you may have not before. This is truly the End, and I wouldn't want it any other way.",End of Evangelion
348,Lagaan: Once Upon a Time in India,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0805300/,"Sony Entertainment's Lagaan is more an experience than a movie.Indian actor Aamir Khan's home production is a cinematic experience which highlights Indian cinema to the hilt, while weaving a tale set in Champaner during the time of the British Empire's presence which deals with Lagaan (the tax of the land) and a village's upheaval against its oppressors.The film revolves mainly around three characters namely Bhuvan (Aamir Khan), Gauri (debutante Gracey Singh) and Elizabeth (British actress Rachel Shelley), and deals with Bhuvan's spirited fight to defend what is his birthright, as he embroils the entire village into a magnitude of problems which inadvertently ends up being their only escape from the tyranny under which they reside. Gauri is the simple village girl who loyally stands behind the man she loves yet cannot profess her love to, while Elizabeth is the beautiful sister of the British Lieutenant and the complication who aids the village in their fight against injustice.The first half sets the scene beautifully, explaining what Lagaan is, introducing the characters and gradually pulling the audience into this period and place, literally taking the viewer into Champaner through cinematography which highlights the locales and sets which establish the standard of living. It makes you feel for the characters, believe in the villagers and draws you into the celluloid created world, while the second presents to you their turmoil, dawns on you what is at stake and whisks you away in a tornado of emotions and rising spirits.The opening scenes are more congruent to joining a conversation midway, as from the moment you are thrust into 1893's India, you gain footing and a sense of atmosphere, feeling at ease as the camera pans across its setting for the movie, drifting into the journey that will hold your attention for the duration of the film. Apart from familiarising the viewer with its characters, the first half also takes you back with its breathtakingly beautiful cinematography and fitting background score. The characters are established, the situation presented and relationships etched, with each scene rhythmically flowing from one to the other in a continuos motion.The second half is less involved in justifying its characters and aims more towards culminating the scene which has been set in the first. By this time you are already a part of this world and your emotions have already been stirred, now they are put to the test as the events which will determine the entire crux of the film begin and get the viewer involved.The romantic triangle between Bhuvan, Gauri and Elizabeth is expertly handled. The beauty of its predicament is that no one feels a loss by the end of the film, and director Ashutosh Gowariker beautifully justifies eternal love (but not necessarily requitted love) through drawing a comparison with the spiritual romance of the Hindu god Krishna and Radha. A delightfully delicately handled scene and situation gives birth to the foundation which will resolve the triangle in a manner leaving warmth in the viewer's heart.Aamir Khan is a revelation. His acting is superb and be it the conviction and fire in his eyes, the way he draws breaths from the air of the abode he calls home or even gulps at the atrocities he witnesses, he has become Bhuvan completely. His portrayal is such that it puts you inside Bhuvan's psyche and enables the viewer to understand the character from his demeanour alone. His piercing eyes stare sharply like razor blades, cutting through the camera and leave a haunting impression on an unsuspecting audience, drawing them more and more deeper into his world.Gracey Singh performs ably and is also an extremely graceful dancer, as particularly evident in the Radha Kaise Na Jale song. She acts with her eyes, eyebrows, nose, mouth, all of her and gives to the role of Gauri completely, giving a debut performance of high calibre.Rachel Shelley makes her presence felt like an ethereal spirit. Apart from looking stunning she adds to whichever frame she is in with panache and style. Her crossover to Indian cinema, or indeed to this film, is delicately handled and a feat to be applauded. To light a face like Shelley's in the same frame as the villagers without making one or the other look considerably darker or awkwardly paler, is a difficult task in itself. But the cinematography, the lighting and make up is such that the characters come alive as physical presences which complement each other, as do Aamir Khan and Rachel Shelley. Her interactions with Bhuvan and the villagers are intricately handled and executed wonderfully, and her inclusion in the O Rey Chori song is poetry on screen. To make a Western character dance in Indian cinema without causing a giggle from the audience or without it appearing unnatural is also something which needs to be handled with careful thought and the result is such that this song picturisation alone will invoke discussion on how beautifully it has been shot.Andrew Russell's boisterous character is brought to life by Paul Blackthorne, as he slides perfectly under the skin of a character that should reflect British pride and be menacing and hostile. He performs well and bounces off the supporting cast with utmost ease. The entire ensemble of supporting cast are deserved of mention, and particularly Raghuveer Yadav, who dynamically brings the character of Bhura across effectively and convincingly with edge.A R Rahman is the composer who has scored for many Indian and South Indian films, and this time too he does not betray his reputation of being a modern day Mozart. He literally teases then grabs you with his music, first resonating your veins, then breaths and finally allowing it to explode and burst through your body like an energy force, flowing in sync with your heartbeat. It's lilting melody, fresh sound and courageous allegros mesmerise and reflect the movie's emotions and spirit of hope. The songs are very well picturised and choreography is excellent, particularly Ghanan Ghanan, O Mitwa and O Rey Chori. The bhajan O Paalanhaare is bewitchingly lit and shot, injecting a spiritual vibe as candles' flickering flames hypnotise every viewer whose eyes dance to its command.The film belongs to Aamir and Ashutosh Gowariker all the way. Direction is superb and results in what is a true mark on Indian cinema, held together by Aamir's awe-inspiring performance.Lagaan is about hope, courage, fighting against injustice, the human spirit and about Indians. You enter the cinema to be entertained, and leave with a piece of cinematic history being firmly etched in your heart.Fuad Omar.",Lagaan
349,The Sixth Sense,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2359046/,"The Sixth Sense enjoys being playful with our imagination. What your eyes see is not exactly what it is.

Having said that, it is one of the movies I love to watch again and again.",The Sixth Sense
350,The Legend of 1900,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2644184/,"Nostalgic and sensitive picture with stirring drama , ravishing cinematography and moving musical score . An epic story of a man who could do anything , except be ordinary . Shortly after the Second World War, Max , a transplanted American (Pruitt Taylor Vince) , visits an English pawn shop to sell his trumpet , there meets a shopkeeper (Peter Vaughan) and a peculiar musical single . Then Max tells the tale in flashback after learning a ship has been condemned (there was actually a registered ship named the SS Virginian which was built in 1904 and scrapped around 1954). As an abandoned infant is discovered aboard the luxury liner in 1900 and reared by an engine labourer (Bill Nunn) and the crew . As an adult is nicknamed Novecento (Tim Roth) and he has become an expert pianist , but since 1900 remains an enigma .The picture contains drama and nostalgia completely wrapped in an enjoyable story between a lone pianist and a trumpet player . The story is narrated with great sense and sensibility , the intelligent screenplay based on monologue Novecento by Alessandro Baricco was written by the same Giuseppe Tornatore . Slightly overrated but excellent all the same time , the picture is enjoyable and entertaining , but overlong . Magnificent performance from Tim Roth as virtuoso pianist in the ship's orchestra who has superstitiously never set foot off the boat and Pruitt Taylor Vince as his trumpet man friend . Good acting from remaining cast such as Bill Nunn as Danny Boodmann , Clarence Williams III as Jelly Roll Morton , Mélanie Thierry as The Girl , Gabriele Lavia as Farmer and Peter Vaughan as'Pops', the Shopkeeper . Originally released under various titles and at 170 minutes , it was re-cut and still had its problems . Glowing cinematography with scenarios colorfully and splendidly photographed by Lajos Koltai who reflects the elegant scenarios .As exterior shots of the ship are the inspired blueprints of the SS Lusitania and her sister ship the SS Mauritania, the ballroom in which 1900 plays his piano in had a dome similar to the dome the SS Mauritania had in her ballroom during the transatlantic period . Rousing and moving score musical by the veteran master and prolific Ennio Morricone who was nominated with a deserved Gloden Globe . The picture was well directed by Giuseppe Tornatore who made similar nostalgic films including good actors , such as the excellent ¨Cinema Paradise¨ with Philippe Noiret , ¨Malena¨ with Monica Belucci , ¨ The star maker¨ with Sergio Castellito and ¨Baaria¨ with Raoul Bova ; being his English-language debut feature titled ¨The professor¨ with Ben Gazzara . Rating of ¨La Leggenda del Pianista Sull'Oceano"" (original title) or ""The Legend of 1900"" or ""The Legend of the Pianist on the Ocean : Better than average, well worth watching for exceptional cinematography , first-rate acting and wonderful score .",The Legend of 1900

Jim Carey, as usually, played an amazing role. He made you think you were him, as the whole movie did. Watch it... its a must.Imagine being captivated all your life in a show, without knowing. Your neighbors, your family, your loved ones... everyone you ever knew were just actors, pretending to be people they are not. Well Truman Burbank not only imagined it, but also lived it. This is a hilarious movie, that will catch you from the first minute you watch it. Just be aware... once you start watching it, it will be difficult to stop.

352,"Chat noir, chat blanc",https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0410215/,"Few films just simply fascinate me. As an American Boomer, I am admittedly spoiled and quite jaded, when it comes to movies. This film tantalized me and enthralled me. I felt like a kid at a carnival. The rich cinematography was palpable. The beauty of the chaotic and very non-Pasteurized world of these kooky gypsies and country folk was unexpectedly stunning. And it was so funny! Just plain old funny! The acting was superb. I recognized some favorite character actors from other films I have seen from Yugoslavia. (Look for the Nail Lady). The only glitch for me was an occasional sense that the subtitles could not convey the full impact of the obviously earthy and colloquial dialogue. The film seems to proudly carry on the zany comedy tradition of Europe in the sixties, such as the Pink Panther series and the Czech ""Firemen's Ball"". I regret I did not see this in a theater with the howling audience it deserves.",N/A
353,"Chat noir, chat blanc",https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0410207/,"This is an extremely quirky film, riddled with crazy caricatures of East European mafiosi and small time crooks. It sports some of the most imaginative characters I have ever seen on a screen (a woman who pulls nails with her buttocks?) and some of the most bizarre scenes.And yet the film is beautifully balanced, never falling into outright lunacy or losing the plot.
The scenes are at times almost nostalgic, a throwback to some simpler time when you could just have fun, no holds barred. And that is exactly what this film does for me - I have not had as much fun in ages. You will leave the theater with a feel-good factor 10 and thank out loud the people who created this gem.Kusturica is a phenomenon.",N/A
354,The Big Lebowski,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3348121/,"It's actually kind of hard to describe this movie (and what's so great about it) to people who don't already know it and love it; as with many cult films, The Big Lebowski will either speak to you (in which case you will become a fervent follower of His Dudeness and abide by his code for the rest of your life) or, if it doesn't, the film will either leave you completely indifferent or you'll even downright hate it.I believe it's a very funny film and I'm sure it can be rightfully called a comedy, but don't expect punchlines, gags, jokes or slapstick - it's not that kind of comedy. If you want to enjoy this film, you have to meet Jeffery ""The Dude"" Lebowski on his terms, hang out with him and his bowling buddies and follow them at a their (perhaps somewhat leisurely) pace through this weird and unbelievable tale about nihilism, theft (of a car and, more importantly: a Creedence Clearwater Revival tape), kidnapping, abstract art, porn and - of course - bowling. The story is actually kind of simple. You see, some no-good German nihilists urinated on The Dude's rug - and this kind of aggression just won't stand against The Dude. With the help of his bowling buddies, he will do everything in his power to get someone to pay for his rug - or possibly get a new one (because that rug really tied the room together). So he embarks on this worthy quest during which he will encounter many wondrous things and fascinating people (even Jesus - who is NOT the messiah but a very naughty man).With Jeff Bridges in the leading role, the Coen brothers have found the perfect actor to incorporate one of the most iconic characters that has ever been created. But it's not just The Dude that makes this a winner; the whole film is such an inspired folly and simply inventive filmmaking at its finest (the hilarious dream sequence alone is worth the price of admission). The supporting cast is outstanding (J.Turturro, J.Goodman and S.Buscemi among many others), the song choices are perfect and the dialog is the funniest, most quotable in any comedy I've ever seen. This - for me - is without a doubt the film with the highest rewatchability factor of all time. 10 stars out of 10.Favorite Films: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls054200841/Lesser-known Masterpieces: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls070242495/Favorite Low-Budget and B-movies: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls054808375/",The Big Lebowski

There are so many glowing reviews here I was expecting some kind of masterpiece but for me this was the biggest yawn fest I've seen in some time.For one thing, I absolutely love foreign films and watch world cinema far more than Hollywood movies... I'd also seen Chungking Express from the same director as this movie and I quite enjoyed that..While technically well made, with some beautiful cinematography, good cinematography does not a good film make.. You could equate it to a photo realistic painting of a stone wall, while the skill is impressive in doing that, it would still be a boring painting.The dialogue was boring, and the plot was thin to say the least! I just couldn't get invested in these characters enough to care.. It became dull and tiresome very fast. Then the same music was used over and over which became very repetitive. I also noted this in Chunking Express which is making me rethink that film and the director...Overall: I'm giving this film a 5 mainly for the cinematography, but I really feel like I wasted what was left of my night watching this instead of something better..",N/A
356,Trainspotting,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0975722/,"After reading some of the reviews that trash this film I had to speak up.This film is gritty and dirty. There is content which is not pleasant, swearing and violence amounts other things. What else would you expect a film about drug addiction to be about? Well more than that actually, it about choices and what you Choose! Never at any point did this film make drugs look at all appealing to me in any way, I never did understand why so many people thought that it did. At no point did it ever say ""Look at this, its cool."" For those who think the level of swearing in this film is too much then they clearly haven't spent any time with working class people in Britain, not just Scotland. I being one of them can say its fairly accurate in that account.That being said, those things do not take anything away from the film, the quality of plot and story, or the acting which is Stunning!

Dark comic undertones and excellent character actor performances dominate this richly macabre crime story gone awry flick by the Coen brothers(Joel and Ethan) involving pathetic used car salesman Macy so hard up for money and respect (not necessarily in that order) that he hires a pair of dim-witted thugs to kidnap his wife for ransom from his father-in-law's vast wealth in a plot-line that unravels with nice little twists and snags.  McDormand (Best Actress) is perfect as a pregnant Midwestern sheriff on the case with a no-nonsense and homespun effect with her tactics of crime solving.  Great cinematography by Roger A. Deakins accentuates the bleak winterscape of unearthed uneasiness.  Nominated for Best Supporting Actor Macy, Best Director, Best Cinematography and Academy Award winner for Best Original Screenplay.",Fargo
358,Fargo,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0384112/,"""What'd this guy look like anyway?""  ""Oh, he was a little guy, kinda funny lookin'.""  ""Uh-huh. In what way?""  ""Just a general way.""  In that interplay between a Brainerd, MN., police officer and a witness  discussing a criminal investigation, you have one of your principal  pieces of dialogue from what is considered by many to be Joel and Ethan  Coen's finest film.  Of course you can draw comparisons to others they've made, such as  Blood Simple, Raising Arizona, even Barton Fink and The Big Lebowski.  But Fargo illustrates the Coen Brothers' takes on plot, art and drama  more succinctly and emotionally than any of those others. Here you have  a set of memorable, if not always likable, characters in a plot that  goes from clunky to chaotic in the most unspoiled manner, from Jerry  Lundegaard's stilted conversation with Gaear and Carl in a bar in Fargo  at the beginning of the movie - the only occasion in which the movie  specifically shows you Fargo, N.D. - to Marge Gunderson's confrontation  with Gaear and the wood-chipper.  Frances McDormand deservedly won an Oscar for playing a well-balanced,  intelligent, pregnant police officer placing her own straightforward  methodology on to an investigation of bizarre goings-on. And William H.  Macy gives a true one-two punch playing a frenetically-charged, fearful  and, in the end, inept used car salesman trying in the most remarkable  manner to make money. The two best scenes in the movie are the two  occasions in which Marge questions Jerry about the Brainerd murders and  a car from his lot being involved -- I couldn't imagine an actress  doing a better job of seriously but comically exclaiming, ""He's fleeing  the interview!""  Notable among the actors as well are Steve Buscemi and Peter Stormare  playing Carl and Gaear, the two hit men hired by Jerry to help him con  his father-in-law out of money. There's comic brilliance watching  Stormare silently grimace at Buscemi's violent but gregarious behavior,  and Buscemi shines being able to play the most out-of-control of all  the characters in the movie. Kristin Rudrüd also stands out playing  Jean Lundegaard, Jerry's haplessly kidnapped wife.  If you can appreciate an intelligent look at not-always-so-intelligent  life on this planet, you'll enjoy the little more than the hour and a  half this movie has to show you.",Fargo
359,La Haine,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2926427/,"'Mean Streets' in french - and so much more. While there are so many references to Scorsese that you could almost call it an homage, this French milestone deals with the disillusioned youth who live in the outskirts of Paris in such an elegant - and honest - way, that I would go so far as to call it the most relevant French film of the last 20 years. But it's also a cinematic masterpiece and great, often hilarious entertainment. Everything fits: the musical choices, the outstanding performances by the 3 main characters, the beautiful cinematography and flawless direction. And, perhaps most of all, THE perfect script. As much a realistic portrayal of a torn society as it is an artistic achievement, 'La Haine' is essential viewing.My vote: 10 out of 10Favorite films: http://www.IMDb.com/list/mkjOKvqlSBs/Lesser-known Masterpieces: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls070242495/Favorite Low-Budget and B-movies: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls054808375/Favorite TV-Shows reviewed: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls075552387/",La Haine

It's starts well, the meeting on the train and the intriguing possibility of what may happen when two strangers meet by chance is alluring but once they start wandering around Vienna it's when it starts to get boring. The dialogue is just the kind of naive, wistful, cod-philosophical nonsense that young couples on their first date come up with to impress the other partner. Fine if you are trying to get laid but it makes for rather irritating viewing. After a while I was more interested in the scenery than what was going on with the main characters. By the end I just wished they'd shut up and get on the damn train!

Trying to get satisfied with 10 points breaks my heart as much as the stories in the film did which are based on two men suffering from love, like the other millions on the planet. The main difference between this one and other romance films is Chong qing sen ling doesn't picture eternal love, people holding hands in hands, kissing or crying and moaning in pain when it's is over. It's more about lead characters just trying to get over the pain and discovering that undying love was never that strong indeed. Talking about getting over the pain, since it's a Kar Wai Wong nobody will dare thinking a typical work.At the first time i watched Chong qing sen ling, what hit me was director's original style in telling his stories, how he could make me feel exactly the same mood with the characters and still no tears in the whole movie. (Besides who needs tears while you can get rid of them by making some sports?) In fact if you are terribly under the influence of this film and you are dumbed by your lover too, don't be surprised when you find yourself drinking five or ten glasses of water in a row or something equally stupid as that. Because stupidity is what we are expected to do when messed with love anyway. Before, through or after the relation, it really doesn't matter, does it?After you watch Chong qing sen ling you won't be the person you used to be. At least California Dreaming will have a special place in your heart, i guarantee that!",Chong qing sen lin (Unknown)
363,Chungking Express,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0335733/,"Every day we interact with people.  Within the course of 24 hours we can influence someone's life (for better or worse) so deeply that they will never forget us.  Is it possible that the next person you fall in love with could be a notorious heroin smuggler or the counter girl at the express luncheonette counter?  Wong Kar-Wai, the writer/director of Chungking Express seems to think so. The film is broken into two tales.  The first story is mainly about the sadder side of love.  Love comes and brings us light and joy, but it also goes and leaves us feeling empty and needing fulfillment.  The two main characters in this half of the film, a police officer played dolefully by Takeshi Kaneshiro, and a heroin smuggler played icily by Bridgitte Lin, interact for only ten percent of the story, but their meeting leaves them both with memories that will last life time.  The story ends on a high note that shows us that a simple act of kindness can bring the most unreceptive people to appreciate the beauty hidden in life. The second (and far stronger) story centers around two people and their interaction at a fast food counter in the Kwaloon section of Hong Kong. Tony Leung plays the part of a rejected lover perfectly and gives of the air of being sad without ever really being pathetic.  Faye Wang's quirky portrayal of the free-spirited counter girl who helps Leung forget about his ex-girlfriend, is exactly what the film needed to counter-balance its darker first half.  These characters and their bizarre relationship illustrates that love can manifest itself in any number of ways, many of them unconventional. The mechanism that allows these seemingly disjointed stories together is the camera work.  Wong Kar-Wai uses a decidedly unique filming technique for much of the first half of the film; a blurry hand-held technique (think Blaire Witch on drugs) used during the chase scenes.  The recurring style in the second half is a time-lapse type shot with people around the main subjects moving very fast and the subjects themselves moving in slow motion (a really cool effect).  The camera styles add a common surreal element to each of the stories, while still keeping them somewhat independent. Perhaps the most striking element of the film is the interconnectedness of the characters and situations.  There are many establishing shots showing characters inhabiting the same places at different times, and even the same places at the same times without noticing each other.  This style of filming can alter the viewer's perception of reality, daring us to believe that we are all extras in somebody else's movie.",Chungking Express
364,Jurassic Park,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4366475/,"This movie is definitely one to remember. Despite being filmed in the 90s, Jurassic Park continues to be a classic to this day. 
Watching the movie now highlights the contrast between the effects then and the special effects available now. This, along with some acting that is a tad overdone, are the only real critiques I would give this film. 
The child actors were especially hilarious to me-the young boy, Timmy, has moments that really capture a reaction that a child in real life would have (""I threw up."" ""Well that's ok! That happens sometimes""-Allen-is one of my favorite quotes). 
Another extremely influential aspect of this film is the music that plays over certain intense scenes and the iconic theme music in the opening/closing. The music combined with the diegetic sound of the dinosaur stomping/approaching builds the suspense and creates an intense tension in the audience. 
As a classic worldwide, it's no wonder that this movie provided the basis for generations of movies to follow.",Jurassic Park
365,In the Name of the Father,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2842064/,"(English is my second language, so please excuse my language problems:)Yes, I cried when other prisoners threw lighted papers from the window; yes, Daniel-Day Lewis and Pete Postlethwaite were great actors; but other than that, what impressed me most was the complete change of attitudes of the public between the two trials. At first, audience in the court were yelling ""hang these Irish bastards"", they were throwing all their hatred to the Guildford Four, even the judge said ""I wonder why you are not charged as treason"". They were biased, cheated by the prosecutes who fabricated lies to cater to the public, because the loss of 5 lives needed someone to be responsible for. But after 15 years, when the truth was presented, the public went to parade, they plead the court to free the four, they wanted to right the wrong. They were becoming rational, they felt for the innocent, so they acted.But this is not what happens here in China. The government is never transparent to the public, the media is censored so that cases like the Guildford 4 (especially if it is injustice) will never be known to the general public unless you are ""in the business"". Because the public is banning from first-hand information, people are unaware of government's wrongdoings; even if they are aware, there is almost nothing they can do (party monopoly, corruption all lead to this). So they kept silent, pretending nothing ever happened. I once read on a book, saying ""silence is the most terrifying weapon"". Today I have to admit this fact; but I want to say and plea to all my fellow citizens: pretending to be deaf doesn't mean that there is no voice in the society to be heard. They are merely sunk in the indifferent public. So please pay attention to politics, to events taking place in courts.

I first saw it in the theater in 1993 and I was rooting for it to win Best Foreign Film Oscar, but it lost to the far inferior Belle Epoque (Spain). As to the person who wrote that this film made Cheng Dieyi seem like he was made to be gay because of abuse, I think you need to take another look. To my mind, Dieyi seemed to be infatuated with Shitzou as soon as he got there. However you look at it, this is a film that has great performances all around. I especially loved Leslie Cheung as the adult Cheng Dieyi (requiem eternem Leslie, 1956-2003), not to mention Gong Li. An excellent film, but be forewarned: it's almost three hours long. 10/10",N/A

It was a story about politics, love, life, faith, all rolled into one exceptional package. Yet none of these messages are hammered into you. They just flow over you in well-timed waves. Many of these Chinese movies are so interesting because of their unique perspective. It's wonderful to immerse yourself in a great film from a different culture.

368,Raise the Red Lantern,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0292680/,"This movie has it all, betrayal, conflict and tragedy. I have to say that I couldn't live without it, effectively anyway. The political criticisms tear at the spine of the film and the beauty of it in such an intimate setting is outstanding. The use of such a rich, three dimensional setting defies what we have been taught by the mainstream as being beautiful and sets a standard on a budget that I would love to be aware of, that all Hollywood movies should aspire to. It shows us that film, real film that is, does not need $100 million to look good, rather the combination of a haunting setting in the middle of vastness and the equally haunting beauty of it's star, Gong Li, but at it's heart the house itself resembles a claustrophobic pot, boiling over the surface.This is in my opinion, Zhang Yimou's greatest film, it is a triumph in film form and narrative. The haunting sounds of flutes, a significant visual and audio element that has a mythical quality due to it's importance to Songlian and becomes an unattainable item of the gods when it is removed from existence when it is burned, becoming a tragic reminder on the attempts to vanquish the personalities of not only Songlian but all of the concubines. It's slow burning nature may repel the masses but anyone who can get a copy, do so without fail, you will never regret it. I cannot stress the importance of this film, we may see it as a study on the oppression of women in China, but this is universal, we westerners once did the same thing not too long ago.For me the cinematography is what sells the film, it is the best I have ever seen and ever will. If there is ever a film to promote the use of the three strip technicolour process once again, this is it. Long after you have finished your post film analysis, the light from the red lanterns will still be searing in your eyes.",N/A
369,Dead Poets Society,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0268463/,"There are certain films that get under your skin, never to come out. They change your life, subtly altering your perceptions of reality, almost always for the better.Dead Poets Society is one of those few films.I saw the movie back when I was in High School. I had a teacher who told us that we really needed to watch it; in fact, it was our ""homework"" for the day. We didn't need to bring back a report, or talk about it in class. All he asked from us was to watch it, make up our own mind about it, and that was it. As you can imagine, many friends of mine didn't watch it at all; I did. And yes, I feel I changed a bit from there on.Back when you are young, you never really stop to think what in the world you are doing with your life. You simply live for the day, hope your grades will be enough to pass, and that's it. Long term thinking involves maybe flirting with a girl. Nothing more. What this film showed me was that we have the responsability and the joy of being alive in this planet. That we are dust, and we will go back to it, so we have precious little time to make a difference. That we have a moral obligation to ""seize the day, and make our lives extraordinary"" (my favorite quote in all movie history). That the world, basically is ours. That the only limitations are within ourselves, and that we owe it to us to fight, to rebel against conformity, to change what we hate and keep what we love. That living in this world is a beautiful responsability, and that only cowards dare not to change it for the better.The fact that the cast was basically my age, and was passing through the same dilemmas and situations I was facing made it all so much more powerful.So here I sit, 12 years from that day. I still don't think I have seized the day completely. But I keep on trying; I always will. I wonder how many people were transformed by this gem of a movie; I hope many.10 out of 10.

What touched me the most was the late River Phoenix's acting, but all of the young actors performances were incredible. They are why you should see this film. 'Stand By Me' is not a bubblegum Disney film, nor a dry Hollywood film; it is a movie that captures childhood in a poignant, non-candy coated manner that is dead on. I saw this movie only a couple months ago and was blown away by it's style and acting. It is rare that you see such fresh, relaxed and deep performances that the actors in this film offered. Although this is not a recent film, it is a genuine, inspiring film that is so refreshing-being so different than the films Hollywood often gives us.

371,Stand by Me,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0237787/,"I find it hard to comment on this film without simply repeating what has already been said. It's not that I can't think of anything original, but that others seem to have felt the exact same emotions as I did when watching this film.I saw this movie when I was about 12, 13, maybe 14 years old. So it didn't have the same nostalgic sense it had for so many. But what it did, was make me ache for those memories. I wanted (in the words of another reviewer) to be 12, and *that* cool. I wished I had been like that, that I had had friends like that, laughed like that, and had adventures like that.The 'milk-money' scene was probably one of my all-time favourite scenes in movie history. Up until I saw this movie I had never held much regard for River Phoenix, but the poignancy and sincerity which River added to the role of Chris Chambers touched me to the point of tears. I read in yet another review that in this scene, River was asked to think of a time when he had been hurt by an adult, and that even after the cameras stopped rolling, River sat there still, sobbing and hurting. And I felt every tear and heard every word as though I were there with Chris.This movie made me laugh, cry, rejoice and fear with Chris, Gordie, Teddy and Vern. I loved the campfire scenes, and today I look back on my own childhood, and remember with a laugh the amazingly similar things I used to laugh and wonder about with my friends. I remember dreaming about being a writer and an actress, I remember standing up to bullies, I remember walking or riding with my friends, I remember being afraid, and crying onto a friend's shoulder.I guess what this movie does for everyone, is take them back in time, even though the situations may have been different, chances are you'll find the similarities, and remember with a smile that yes, your life was once *that* cool.

372,"Paris, Texas",https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2489292/,"Throughout the entirety of Paris, Texas's two-and-a-half-hour running time (and not one minute of it wasted), it's nearly impossible to take your eyes off Harry Dean Stanton. When he first appears, he's animalistic, not talking, motivated only by his strange, unreadable desires. Later on he starts talking and starts having more conventional desires, but there's always that wild, uncertain edge to his performance, so that there's always a step remove between us and him. His Travis is a dangerous character, as much for the audience as the other characters. He's entranced by spectacle -- the vast emptiness of the Texas horizon, the story of his own conception, the falsity of a peep show, the million artificial lights of Los Angeles, and the obsession that gives the film its name, the story of his conception in a fake Paris. He tries, but is ultimately unable to deal with the reality of his actions, and in the end is reduced to passively watching a spectacle again, seeing his son end ex-wife embrace from a distance.Travis's brother Walt seems to be the opposition to his wild ways, someone the audience can relate to in their attempts to deal with the strangeness of Travis. But Walt also lives in a world trapped by images: he creates billboards, simulacra if there ever were any, and creates a model family that is ultimately an untenable attempt at playing house (his wife is notably French, tying in his obsessions to Travis's). We are presented with two quintessential American images: the warm suburban nuclear family and the rugged loner prowling the frontier, but both are illusions and both bring only suffering.All of this is to say nothing of the technical excellence of Paris, Texas: the gorgeous cinematography, the note-perfect acting from not just Stanton but the rest of the cast as well, those two heartbreaking long scenes near the end... but all of this is also spectacle, and at the same time the film is drawing us in with its execution it's warning us of the dangers of the seductive image. My favourite films are, for the most part, films that are at least in part about the act of watching. Paris, Texas falls into these two overlapping categories neatly.","Paris, Texas"
373,"Paris, Texas",https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2142709/,"I would say that Paris, Texas is not for everyone, but, truly, that can be said about every movie. But I will say this: fans of methodically paced, beautifully shot, existentially rooted, and purely experiential cinema will not be disappointed. Paris, Texas is virtually my favorite movie, and a movie that, whether you like it or not, will leave some impact on you. It is a journey, an experience, an odyssey. Yes, it is long. Yes, it is slow. Defined plot points? Please.But what this movie does do is place into the mind of it's lead character. Travis Henderson, an older man, gruff and worn out with age, wanders out of the Texas desert after missing from his family for four years. He is mute, and apparently unaware of who he is. His brother Walt finds him, and tries to rehabilitate him back into sanity. The film then covers Travis's journey to reconnect with a past which he has long since forgotten. He reunites with his son, his sister in-law, and eventually, in a scene which I tear up just thinking about, his wife.But that is all I will divulge about his wife. That is a scene which you really have to see to believe. While this film really doesn't rely on plot, it does have structure and tone. And what carries us through this mystical story is the unbelievably beautiful photography. We see the world as it should be seen: a starkly beautiful, but uncompromising, place. The use of color and motifs really makes this film a marvel to look at. And then we get to performances. Everyone's great, so I will focus on our two truly main characters. Harry Dean Stanton plays Travis, a gentle, kind man, that, despite having personal demons, is a great fatherly figure (fine, maybe he isn't the best father...but there's no denying he left an impact on his son's life). And seeing Stanton bring this character to life in the most subtle and somber way possible is amazing. And then we have Natassja Kinski, who plays Jane, his wife. She doesn't show up until the third act, and 95% percent of her performance takes place in one room. But Kinski's portrayal of emotion...and her quiet, yet powerful demeanor...and the way she talks...god, it's unbelievable. Stanton and Kinski have some of the best chemistry ever, which is even more impressive considering they're never in the same room (see the movie...you'll understand). In the end, these two carry the movie on their backs, and do an amazing job doing it.You may not cry, but you will think about crying. You will think about all the sad moments in your life. And it will all be washed out of you by movie's end. Believe me, I know this from personal experience. This movie is almost therapeutic in the way. Because the story is healing our own souls at the same time as it is healing Travis's. So. What's more to say about Paris, Texas? It's a beautiful movie, one that relies on photography and performances to tell it's story, and a movie that portrays emotions on a master class level. And what do I mean by 'Anti-Romance'? It's not worth explaining here. See the movie, you'll understand.","Paris, Texas"
374,Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1085060/,"""Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind"" was Miyazaki's second movie, adapted from his own comic book. Viewers of the film may become involved in debates regarding the movie's relation to the comic(they are exceedingly different). I personally advise looking at them both as separate, but equally great pieces of art.Regarding the film: The music is lush(the first film score of Miyazaki-veteran Jo Hisaishi), the animation impressive despite a few passages of static character movements, and the eponymous heroine is a figure of brilliant characterization; gentle, kind, valiant, passionate and pained.It may lack the cognizant wisdom of ""Princess Mononoke"", perhaps, but NOTVOTW doesn't suffer by the comparison. I highly recommend checking it out.",Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind
375,Fitzcarraldo,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1284227/,"Visually, this is a stunning film with incredible cinematography of the South American jungles--especially the scene in the rapids. Though the team of Werner Herzog (director) and Klaus Kinsky (lead actor) also teamed up for another Peruvian jungle film (Aguirre: The Wrath of God) just a few years earlier, this film is MUCH more beautifully filmed--as if the prior film allowed Herzog to learn and perfect his craft for the later film. Plus, I found the overall experience more interesting and involving than AGUIRRE. About the only drawback is that at times I felt a bit disconnected from the main character, Fitzcarraldo. I was fascinated by his actions but ultimately didn't really care ABOUT him. While this isn't necessary for a film to be good, it did prevent me from giving the film a slightly higher rating. HOWEVER, this film deserves major kudos for being different and for all the trouble it took to film.Also, if you do see the film, also try to see the documentary ""Burden of Dreams""--a making of feature for ""Fitzcarraldo"". When you do see it, you learn just how difficult it was to make the film--as if the production was somehow cursed because so many problem occur trying to get the picture completed--such as the loss of the original leading man, Jason Robards.",Fitzcarraldo
376,Fitzcarraldo,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1066358/,"Based on a historic figure, this is the story of Brian Sweeney Fitzgerald (Klaus Kinski), known as ""Fitzcarraldo"", an eccentric visionary living in Amazonia. He first tried building a Trans-Andean Railroad, but went bankrupt. When we meet him, he's trying to make a living by selling ice to Amazonia natives, although we first see him on a small boat with his sometimes significant other, Molly (Claudia Cardinale). They've traveled 1200 miles down the Amazon to an opera house to hear Enrico Caruso sing, because Fitzcarraldo is an opera fanatic who especially loves Caruso. He loves opera so much that he dreams of building an opera house in the relatively remote outpost of Iquitos, Peru, where he's been living. Understandably unable to find backers for such a venture among Iquitos' wealthy rubber industry leaders, Fitzcarraldo hits upon a scheme for making a bundle of money, and which would eventually enable him to fund the opera house himself. Unfortunately, not all goes as planned.Fitzcarraldo was a notoriously difficult film to make. Documentarian Les Blank even made his own film detailing some of the difficulties and apparent ironies, The Burden of Dreams (1982). Director Werner Herzog hauled his cast and crew to Amazonia for the shoot, where they ended up trapped in the rain forest for months. At one point the filmmakers' camp was set fire by Indians who objected to the production, there was an air crash in which some of the crew died, and a couple outrageous ""stunts"" in the film--including the main plot device of the climax--actually were outrageous, dangerous tasks rather than safe effects/model shots, as we'd expect them to be. Just the idea of pulling off the main stunt caused the Brazilian engineer initially associated with the project to abandon involvement. A number of cast members also backed out, including Mick Jagger and Jason Robards, who were both signed on at different points to play Kinski's role. Knowledge of these kinds of issues makes Fitzcarraldo even more fun to watch, and makes the fact that it was completed at all, not to mention that it is such an elegant masterpiece, more remarkable.The tone of Fitzcarraldo overall closely matches Kinski's depiction of titular character. It is quirky and surreal, but very subtly yet satisfyingly so, with both an almost garish bizarreness (Kinski is quite odd looking in a way) balanced with a sublime beauty. Herzog imbues the film with a lot of gorgeous cinematography, enhanced by his unique sense of pacing. For example, he'll set the mood of a dawn/dusk scene with a lingering shot of a colorful sky, which then functions as symbolic of a night's events without directly showing them. Herzog matches this same technique in his action--he has an ability to say as much with what he doesn't show his actors doing (or saying) as with more conspicuous content.Herzog also shows himself to be a master of selecting music to enhance mood and tell a story, as he balances an atmospheric Brian Eno-ish score from Popol Vuh, native jungle music, and vintage turn or the century recordings of Caruso singing Bellini, Verdi, Puccini and such. Of course opera is an important plot device that enters the film at various critical points. Even if you don't like opera, however, Herzog and Kinski make it (and the motivation for it) attractive in context, and you may just find this film beginning to turn around your feelings for that music.It's interesting to note that even with Herzog's unusual pacing, the flow of the film always seems ""natural"". Fitzcarraldo also has an unusual plot structure, as it almost stream-of-consciously moves from opera in a formal European-seeming setting to a historical dramatic depiction of eccentrics in a native-filled Peruvian town, and then to an exciting adventure tale that is the heart of the film before it finally reaches an irony-filled, beautifully surreal dénouement. The constant throughout all of this is Fitzcarraldo, of course, who can't help being eccentric but charming, both to the film's audience and to other characters.Fitzcarraldo is often interpreted as being somewhat critical of western encroachment on other cultures, such as Amazonia. Under this view, Herzog is usually seen as ironically ""guilty"" of the same actions that he's indicting. However, the film does not read as criticism to me. It's much more in line with what is usually considered to be a romantic tendency in Herzog. Fitzcarraldo is not at all a villain in the film, and neither are the European rubber barons. Instead, Fitzcarraldo is lovable and admirable if a bit crazy. The introduction of western culture doesn't end up being a negative. The natives in the film still retain their unique identities, and efforts are made to interact with them in their manner, not to adapt them to Eurocentrism. Cultural change may be inevitable with interaction, but the message of Fitzcarraldo is more that the interaction can produce unique, worthwhile cultures that are amalgamations of their precursors.Another interesting subtext is that of Fitzcarraldo as Orpheus. Just as Orpheus enchanted wild beasts, trees and rocks on Mount Olympus with his lyre, causing them to ""move from their places"", Fitzcarraldo uses opera to enchant the natural world in which he is ensconced, eventually ""moving mountains"".",Fitzcarraldo
377,Fanny and Alexander,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3491161/,"I've watched this movie many years ago when I was still a teen or maybe in my early twenties. It was horrible. It was so depressing that I decided never to watch an Ingmar Bergman film again. It was my first and only one. Yes, I know that Bergman is considered a great artist. And yes, maybe this film is a piece of art. But even now after so many years, having forgotten about all the details of the story, I still feel the depression. I will not rate the movie because I don't want to be unfair. But I really wish I hadn't watched this.So be warned. If you think you have to watch this because it's movie history, go ahead. But if you are a sensitive person you might be tortured by the hopelessness.",N/A
378,Fanny and Alexander,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0193397/,"SPOILER: Most of the ideas revealed through mystery by Bergman in Fanny och Alexander have already been addressed by others. The first time I saw this film was in 1984, on tv and with a much shorter version than the one released in England in 2002, which is the full 300-plus minute original.That day I was scared -really scared- watching the scene where Alexander is been helped to let out his most evil thoughts by Ishmael, a completely mysterious character with supernatural insight. And then, a blackout. You can imagine: if I was truly scared this left me breathless.Then, almost twenty years passed until I found this remarkable jewel, in its full version, perfectly digitised and audio-enhanced in dvd. I bought a dlp projector and used a previewing room to show it to my students. I didn't know what was going to happen. But that doubt was worth the waiting.I think it's very difficult to say any other thing than breathtaking to underline what this film accomplishes. It's the reflected work of years of understanding and hard work between Bergman and Nyvqvist. One of the most powerful, beautiful, fearful and perfect films of all times. An exaggeration, like. Yes, but I think that there are no words to explain how plainly perfect this work is. The way it was written. The way it was directed. The way it was lighted. The way it was designed. The way each and every character plays his or her role. The details -not a Bergman's new- to which they paid the most dedicated attention to. The luxurious use of available light. The setting of the story. The amazing locations. Everything in this film was perfectly studied, down to the colour shifts that would take place in every shot!, forget about whole scenes!The troubling minds of all those characters whose lives are at crossroads. The powerful and eventful lives of just one familiy. The small and big affairs that affect them. Gratitude and hate. Honour and shame. Guilt and love. Fear and joy. Selfishness and generosity. Every long scene exudes with tension, pure fun or pleasure; with increasing uneasiness and abrupt changes of demeanor. With a richness that could only be found where a very skillful eye -trained to see what most disregard as common- finds beauty and harmony. And a sound that is as exhilarating as the narrative depiction.When the maxim of making ""every frame a Rembrandt"" comes to my mind, this film makes me think Bergman pushed the envelope a little further: he gives (or I'd rather say, Nyvqyst) the tratment of Van Der Meer or Bosch or Cezanne or Michelangelo to some scenes. (Think the kids playing at the nursery, the housemaidens sewing socks, the meadow and the boat, the transfixing scene of Alexander in the attic with his mother).And a story told from the eyes of two kids worth a ton of gold. Alexander's (Bertil Guve, when he was twelve-thirteen) enormously powerful and convincing role can certainly be compared to any big-theatre-role actor.Superb. Don't think you've seen the whole thing until you get the 5  hour full-story.",Fanny och Alexander
379,Blade Runner,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4295221/,"Blade Runner describes a future in which, through genetics, artificial humans are manufactured and called ""replicants""; employees in dangerous jobs and slaves in the outer colonies of the Earth.

A special police force, Blade Runners, is in charge of identifying, tracking and killing - or ""withdrawing"", in terms of the police itself - the fugitive replicants found on Earth. With a group of replicants loose in Los Angeles, Rick Deckard, the best agent that has existed in regard to the recovery and removal of the replicas, is removed from his semi-retirement to use some of ""the old magic blade runner"".Ridley Scott fantastic dark cyberpunk style and futuristic design is so well made that accomplished to create a visual vocabulary: abandonment, decay, loneliness, obscurity, indifference, alienation and neon lights are the core of the aesthetics of the film, which will eventually become and serve as a pattern for successive cinematographic works.The script David Webb Peoples adapted from 'Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?' takes the viewer into a dwelling and philosophical controversy, as it creates doubt and empathy to the so called replicants, primarily as seen in many shots of Rick Deckard hesitating about the true nature of his task.Harrison Ford and Rutger Hauer haunts the attention into the essence of the story. Their characterization throughout infiltrates the different conceptions of life. A saddened soul searching for the meaning of his punished existence and the other, ruminating a task sinking him into a moral void brimming with guilt.At the end, the movie leaves you wondering about the implications the creation of highly intelligent beings (IA) must have and, if it's worth treating them as machines or they have become so human that the difference is non existent.""Time... to die"".10/10",Blade Runner

Hurt rises to the occasion and delivers a heart wrenching Oscar nominated performance emoting under tons of make-up to full effect.  Equally good is Hopkins in low-key form as the humanitarian doctor.  Beautiful black and white photography resonates the production; nominated for 8 Academy Awards including Lynch and Best Picture.

It might not appear that way at first because the film does have its share of simple slapstick and ""naughty"" moments, but generally, the topics the Pythons tackle here are very serious - albeit dealt with in a way that makes this a true contender for the funniest film of all time. A firework of hilarious sketches, timeless quotes and clever comments on the human condition, this film was deemed too dangerous for the masses and therefore, until recently, banned in several countries (normally, this only used to happen to the so called ""Video Nasties"").This film never once makes fun of Jesus (Christ) - but it DOES take the mickey out of blind, fanatic followers of any political movement or religion.An outstanding achievement and endlessly re-watchable.

382,The Deer Hunter,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2663017/,"I will not repeat much of the comments in the previous positive reviews, but will stick mostly to how the movie affected me. First off, I am an Army veteran of the Vietnam War. Thus there is much in this picture that deeply moves me. I still can not listen to the theme music piece played by John Williams, ""Cavatina"", without choking up and weeping.I identify much with the characters in this movie. I grew up in a very small town and come from a working class ( Norwegian, Scots-Irish, English) background. Two weeks out of high school and at the age of 17 I enlisted in the Army. Like the men in this movie I came from a tradition of serving one's country in the military. Both my brother, two cousins and my future brother-in-law also served in the Vietnam War.I identify with Michael, played by Robert DeNiro in his sense of honor in going back to 'Nam and trying to bring back his buddy Nick. Additionally I admire Mike when he visits Steven in the VA hospital and brings him back home. Honor is, as mentioned in the movie ""Rob Roy"", a gift a man gives to himself. Michael (and the movie) doesn't waste time on whether the war in Vietnam is right or wrong. Michael just does what he thinks is right with respect to his buddies. Ask any one who has served in the military and they will tell you that you're sense of commitment to your comrades almost takes precedence over your commitment to your country.I do not see this movie as either pro or anti-Vietnam War. To me the movie portrays how war affects three individuals. It is a movie about character, honor, loyalty------what you are when everything around you is falling apart. I will continue to see this movie many times as I hope that the values depicted in it will still be reflected (albeit weakly) in me.In closing, I can not help to remember that the politically anti-Vietnam War movie ""Coming home"" starring Jane Fonda and Jon Voight was also up for the same Oscars. When Jane Fonda was asked what movie would win the Academy award that year, she sneeringly replied that she hoped it wasn't ""The Deer Hunter"". In the years since Jon Voght has transitioned from being a Liberal to a Conservative. Parenthetically, Jane Fonda has never apologized for her pro-Viet Cong actions. At the age of 66, I am still proud that I served my country and volunteered for the US Army and the Vietnam War.",The Deer Hunter

The film affected all the sports films after it had a positive effect.,N/A
384,Rocky,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0980325/,"It's hard to explain what this movie means to me. Words could never. I remember when I was a kid, I never liked the first Rocky, was too obsessed with III and IV. It happened when I was 11 and I went to see V in the theater. I never been to a movie like that before. People were screaming and cheering. Shook the whole damn place. They were dancing in the isle's and celebrating. It was then I realized the true power of Stallone's vision. The realization that only the original would ever really matter.Rocky to me is so many things. I had to beg my girlfriend to see it. She said she doesn't like boxing. I almost dumped her right there. If she wasn't so hot, I probably would have. I was crushed that someone could think that this movie is about boxing. To me it was never that. It's about a guy, much like you or me, who's down on his luck and everyday feels like Sunday. He's pushing 30, single and broke. I'm sad to say that at this moment it almost reminds me of myself. Every minute more another reason. It's hard to pick my favorite scenes from the movie. I love the chemistry between Rocky and Adrian (Shire). When he's talking to door and she finally comes out and then stops to look in the mirror. It's a thing of beauty. Or when Mickey (Meredith) goes over to Stallones apartment. Rocky gets upset and punches his shitty wall, then goes to hide in the bathroom. The look on Stallone's face when he comes out to find Mickey still there is priceless. I heard it wasn't in the script or directed, just happened. But the one that does it for me is when he comes home in the opening scene after the chapel fight. He turns on his record player and goes for a beer, but it's empty, like everything else in his life. Talks to the turtles and his fish, why because the Rock is lonely. Goes to the mirror and practices a joke for his love. Looks at a picture of himself and realizes he's wasting his life. It's more than beautiful or real.It's safe to say that I have seen the original more than 100 times. I still feel all the emotion. I love this movie more than any other film. I hope one day, with God's help, to show it to my kids and have them feel the same way. I think if I ever got the chance to meet Stallone, I'd want to thank him. Tell him how he changed my life. But in reality, he probably wouldn't care. Because, ""I'm at least half a bum.""",Rocky
385,Network,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0148816/,"When this movie came out in '76 I didn't bother seeing it because I rejected the premise as implausible; the very idea that a network anchor would go nuts on the air and become a hook for ratings seemed ridiculous on its face.
Would that it were so.Today we have Jerry Springer, Maury Povich, Howard Stern, etc. etc. etc. At the beginning of the movie a drunken Max Schumacher (William Holden) fantasizes about a show called ""the Death Hour"" comprised of films of car crashes, suicides, train wrecks, and so forth, to be put on Sunday night in prime time. ""It'll blow Disney outta the f------g water!"" he laughs. A few years back some network put exactly such a show - ""Eye Witness Videos"" - on the air. On Sunday night. In prime time. In short, as most everyone here has commented, ""Network""'s horrifying vision - brilliantly written by the incredibly prescient Paddy Chayevsky -  has been truly and frighteningly prophetic, and rings absolutely true today.The movie is a veritable feast of tour-de-force acting from all involved. In particular  William Holden's wrenching performance as the burned-out but still sensitive Max is drop-jaw stunning. I feel he, not Finch, should have gotten the Oscar, though Finch's work is not exactly chopped liver either. And what a brilliant device on Chayevsky's part to make the lunatic Howard Beale the only one of the bunch with clarity of vision.
That the film is intended to be a satire and a comedy is clear from the narration, especially the final comment about Beale becoming the first man to be killed because of lousy ratings. But it is without doubt the blackest black comedy ever filmed. A lasting legend of filmmaking art.",Network
386,Network,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1803766/,"To think that this blackest of black comedies was made in 1976 could only means two things: 1) Nothing has changed or 2) Paddy Chayefsky was seeing the future with the most disturbing clarity. I endorse the later of the two because I believe things have changed since 1974 - I wasn't born yet, but I know because of my parents, the movies, literature, etc, etc, etc. Peter Finch as the mad prophet of the airwaves gives Chayefsky a riveting and powerful voice. The scenes between old chums Finch and William Holden are some of the best written scenes in any American movie until the Coen brothers emerged. Finch is superb, superb! and Holden, at the end of a legendary career, gives a performance of such ferocious sincerity that I rediscovered the man, the actor and felt the need to revisit some of his opus. From Golden Boy to Sunset Boulevard, Holden was a man who carried his own discomfort as a weapon. Extraordinary! However, the most alarming character in the whole thing is Faye Dunaway's. She is magnificent in her thin, nervous, bra-less attitude. She is a monster of commercial amorality. Everything in this incredible movie moves with the precision of an inspired clairvoyant's vision. Duvall's executive, Beatrice Straight's betrayed wife and Ned Beatty's god like big shot makes this one of the most frightening, entertaining, funniest, remarkable film from the 70's. Sidney Lumet proves once more that he's as good as his material. Here he is at his zenith.",Network
387,Barry Lyndon,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0140168/,"Spoilers herein.Kubrick is a hard filmmaker to touch. He's obviously competent, even brilliant in some ways. And a few of his films -- `Strangelove' comes to mind -- make enough sense superficially that one is not compelled to go farther. The problem is that Kubrick never gives us much hint that his films are a whole different beast than the others on the shelf at the video store. I think he relished the confusion.Most films tell a story in the old fashioned way: time moves, things happen, characters act. In these films, the story is largely apart from the storytelling. Because film is different than everything else, the means of storytelling are unique to film. And because film is still new, we have lots of room for discovering how to tell a story.So we have the vast majority of filmmakers and viewers who think of a film purely in terms of the story. But we have another group of people who watch the storytelling, and perhaps (like myself) don't demand that much from the story itself. That's why we admire empty stylists like De Palma, but of course prefer master visual storytellers like Kurosawa.The holy grail is when the narrative of the conventional threads and the cinematic ones mesh, or are coordinated in some clever way. By cinematic threads, I mean a narrative invested in the very fabric of the camera, like `Marienbad,' like `Pillow Book,' like Welles' `Othello,' or with the aid of actors like `Sweet and Lowdown,' or `Vanya on 42nd Street.' There's a sublime joy to parallel immersion in both the story and cinematic narratives.But sometimes along comes a Kubrick to confound us. I spent a lot of time with `Eyes Wide Shut' before understanding it, because I was looking for the tie with the story. But Kubrick has the equation the other way around. The primary narrative anchor is in the cinematic narrative. The story isn't a skeleton around which the filmmaking takes place, rather an annotation or an incomplete dream that results from it. Jarmusch, Malick, and Kar-wai Wong (`In the Mood for Love') have this same attitude, with minor twists.Freed from limiting expectations, I am now able to enjoy `Barry Lyndon' in more the way I think Kubrick saw it. It is not a story about a Black Irish told through pretty pictures. It is a visual tone poem on the seduction of beauty, with a dissonance between natural beauty and cosmetics. The primary story is visual. It needs space. It needs time. (`2001' has the same cinematic narrative, with the `cosmetics' being logic; the minor twist in `Clockwork' is that the cultural cosmetic is in the future.)The part of the narrative that O'Neal contributes is a loose stitching of this to plot elements as seasoning to help our digestion: war/ gambling, arbitrary privilege, duals and duels, face and body costumes, superposition of languages.The ironic point is that Kubrick tricks you into soaking up the lushness, and doesn't punish you at the end. That's why you leave the theater feeling guilty and not knowing why. (He takes away one of our legs -- the story -- and sends us to wander in America, not quite sure what has happened to us.) Can you think of any other artist with that power?",Barry Lyndon
388,The Mirror,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4094618/,"Seriously people, a poem? You can't be serious. 
The film has merits, some lovely shots, some good mood stuff, but I found it utterly painful and pretentious... self conscious and messy. Apparently Tarkovsky stated that the artist himself does not necessarily know the meaning of an image but is compelled to express his vision. What a grandiose sense of self... guided by God, I suppose. Taking a pile of snippets of history and then blurting them out and sticking bits together with an almost invisible narrative does not make ""poetry"". I didn't mind the occasional sloppy filmmaking, like the sight of the tracks on the right of frame in the last shot, or the microphone shadow in one of the dull dialogue scenes, but really did mind that it was just utterly painful to watch. Perhaps I am not intelligent or deep enough to understand this poem. Or perhaps this is the most over-rated movie in history.",N/A
389,The Mirror,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0139383/,"I just finished watching it. It's been several years since I saw it last time. I worried that I may not like it as much as I used to...I should not have worried - I love it even more now if that is at all possible. I've seen it at different times of my life - first, as a college student many years ago in Moscow; I keep returning to it all my life.When Tarkovsky's Zerkalo (The Mirror) was first released, it divided the audience completely. I remember how my friends were passionately discussing it. One girl was complaining that she did not understand anything; the movie was confusing for her, dark, disturbing, the children characters - sad, pale, poorly dressed. I remember her asking, ""Why did they show a boy in the opening scene that had an awful stutter, and they never showed that boy again? What did it mean when the dying man in bed was setting a bird free? How did he get the bird on the first place?"" Another friend of mine, a guy, tried to explain the things to her. He suggested that she thought about the times Zerkalo was showing, he tried to explain to her Tarkovsky's symbolism where the bird could be representing life and soul of the main character and the boy with the stutter could mean that it was most difficult for people to communicate and understand each other.I only listened to their argument and did not participate because I had not seen the film yet. When it finally happened, Andrei Arsenievich Tarkovsky was presented at the screening and he talked to the audience before the show. I remember him repeating over and over that there were no tricks, no puzzles, and no tongue-in-cheeks in the film; that every symbol, image, dialog, and sound was there because they belonged there. He asked us if we had questions. Someone from the audience suggested that we saw the film first, and then, asked questions. Tarkovsky replied that from his experience, not many viewers would sit through the film and who ever would, usually leave in silence, not asking anything. And then he told us a story. After Zerkalo was completed, it was first shown to the group of the famous critics. After watching it, critics started to argue about it, trying to find the hidden meaning and make sense of what they just saw. It went on and on until the cleaning lady who came to the screening room and had been waiting for the end of discussion to do her job, asked them for how long they would stay? Someone said to her that they were discussing a very complicated film, and they needed time to understand it. Cleaning lady asked, ""What is that you do not understand in this film? I saw it also, and I understood everything."" Critics were silenced for a moment, and then, one of them asked the woman to share her thoughts on Zerkalo. She answered, ""It is about a man who had caused too much pain to the ones whom he loved and who loved him. Now he is dying and he is trying to ask them for forgiveness but he does not know how."" After the pause Tarkovsky said that he had nothing else to add about his film to what the cleaning lady had to say.I never understood complains that Zerkalo is a very confusing, difficult, and dark film. No, it is clear and deep as a mirror. Tarkovsky said so himself, and I believe him. Every time you look at the mirror, it will show you new depth and reflections. Past, presence, future, memory, love, guilt, forgiveness, beauty, sadness, nostalgia, and sacrifice - the mirror reflects it all -just watch closely. This is the film about his family, his country, and his times. Childhood memory and the memory of the past generations glued together. The film is a look back in time and sad realization that children reflect destiny of fathers, as in a mirror. Destinies reflected one in another.Zerkalo is not just good cinema, it is pure cinema. Like architecture is music in stone, Zerkalo is poetry on screen.",Zerkalo (The Mirror)
390,Cries & Whispers,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2649769/,"""Cries and Whispers"" directed by Ingmar Bergman, is a fantastic film about that follow themes of the human condition, the face of death, and the meaning of suffering. And in creating these themes, all he needs are four actresses of impeccable acting skill.Ingmar Bergman is a director unlike any other. He comes from the theatre and as a result transfers theatric style images into his movies. In fact, he is known for his wonderful aesthetic close up shots. In these shots, years of a persons life are viewed, as their facial crevices and deep black eyes are intimately exposed relentlessly. Lets begin with the cinematography. Every scene includes three colors; red, black, and white. Red obviously alludes to dominance and force, a characteristic that haunts Karen and Maria as they each hold their own fiery hatred towards each other. The white represents innocence, possibly strictly for the maid who endlessly cares for Agnus as she dies. At the end of the film, though, her innocence is disrespected and she truly realizes the cruelty of the world, as her help and comfort towards Agnus is dismissed as petty and ""coming with the job"". Lastly, the color black infers death, such as Agnus is enduring through the film, and it sets a bleak resonance in the shots that gives off a gloomy vibe. The acting is utterly impeccable. Hardly does one ever witness so much emotion and character in the faces of Karen and Maria in any film. From their lips, to their wrinkles, to their eyes and bosoms, Karen and Maria only need to be filmed to feed viewers an emotional experience. In fact, Bergman emotionally makes you almost feel suffocated, just as the characters do, as their eyes pierce the camera and their faces fill up the entire screen. You almost wish they would look elsewhere to break the tension, such as in the opening shot where Agnus breathes in pain for nearly three minutes, watching her cry and weep in misery. Bergman utterly invades the every corner of the films space with their beautiful faces that disturb and haunt the viewers in a romantic and torturous way.Lastly, the entire film is shot inside until the last scene where the sisters walk with each other in a beautiful garden. Coming back to the feeling of suffocation, because every scene is inside, not only do the characters yearn to escape and get free, but the viewer, especially myself, yearned for the outside. I almost felt like I needed to leave the theatre because the gloomy indoors and the lacking sunshine was so dampening to the soul that you could be barely breath in. The only air smelt of pain, suffering, and dysfunction, truly infecting the windpipes and crushing your wishes for beautiful air and scenery. Bergman did a fantastic job with this film. He invades viewers comfort zone through magnificent close ups and color schemes. His unflinching actresses display miles of emotion and we are left beaten down and battered after the end of the film. Bergman wants to show us that dysfunction of miscommunication is truly at fault for the death, and that in the face of death, people tend to be cowards and selfish. That suffering is only to show those who do not suffer to change, and change fast, or else the same fate awaits them.If you want to be moved, and disturbed, not by the grotesque, but by the storm of violent emotions, then witness the beautiful masterpiece called ""Cries and Whispers"".",Cries and Whispers
391,Cries & Whispers,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1022885/,"Cries and Whispers is a powerful study of three sisters and a faithful maid who share a manse in a remote location. One of the sisters, the sympathetic and essentially good-hearted Agnes (Harriet Andersson in a gut-wrenching performance), is dying from an indeterminate cancer, and it is her slow journey towards death, its effect on her sisters and Anna the maid, and its aftermath that is the center of this story. Though why she, and not her sisters, should be afflicted, neither the movie nor Bergman can explain, and rings out as an injustice.The reason if, the other two sisters are variations of monstrous people who are successful: Karin (Ingrid Thulin) is what seems to be an icy control freak, not a horrible woman, but close, who cannot stand human touch of any kind, and we're privy to her torment in a flashback where she uses a piece of a broken wine glass to literally mutilate her vagina, seemingly enjoying it (as she shocks her husband), while writhing in unspeakable pain. Maria (Liv Ullmann) shows less, is more of an enigma and a hard character to pinpoint, but she's equally manipulative if not flatly repulsive: she not only tries to resume an affair with Agnes' doctor (who points out she her internal ugliness is starting to show through her facial expressions as she apparently enjoys this criticism) but she also fails to help her husband at a critical moment when he stabs himself in the stomach. Later on, both sisters (particularly Karin) verbally express their hatred for each other in a powerful montage that leads to a moment of equally intense reconciliation that comes without the use of dialogue and is emphasized by the swell of music (Chopin). Ingrid Thulin stands out, letting the gamut of Karin's sheer rage our out of her visage while suddenly changing back to a softer self, then to her steely image of self-control and back to fury in a snap of fingers.There's a lingering question throughout the movie: there must have been some extreme trauma, some truly horrific event (or events), that must have set forth the deluge of pain that rips throughout the entire story right up until the end. Karin herself alludes to the ""tissue of lies"" that could mean anything: possible sexual abuse by the unseen father, a complicity between Maria and her mother, and Agnes in the center, rejected. Although Karin does mention the revulsion she felt towards Maria, one can only wonder what it was that transpired which seems to have driven her into momentary lapses of insanity. In fact, her self-hatred mirrors Agnes' intense suffering rather closely, although both characters rarely interact and are on entirely different planes. In some ways, it wouldn't be out of place to say that Agnes, despite the unimaginable suffering she endures, serves as merely a catalyst, a materialization of the horror Karin herself has had to face. At least Agnes has experienced a form of love, if selfless, under the guise of Anna who comes to her aid, gives of her breast in an almost saint-like passion. Karin only has the cold future of her own dismal life to face. And Maria isn't even alive, but sadistically observing.Aside from PERSONA this has to be one of Ingmar Bergman's most powerful works, one that hits an audience at a gut level (cliched as though it may sound). The dominant color red only adds tension to the already tense scenes between the quartet of women (and the men, who only make pat but indelible appearances). Woody Allen would use these stylizations of the face looking dead at the camera, telling a story of its own in INTERIORS, another looks at three sisters, neither of them sympathetic. Grueling, sometimes unwatchable, this is movie watching at its best.",Cries and Whispers
392,Solaris,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0126181/,"If you compare this movie to the Lem's novel there are a lot of differences. But don't compare them. The novel and movie have their own lives. I personally prefer movie. Tarkovsky is going beyond the limits described by Lem. It is not only the problem of Solaris planet and the relationship between main heroes. Tarkovsky reminds everybody that the origin of our problem is us. And all kind of the most important life keys you can find inside yourselves. The great Swedish director Ingemar Bergman said, that Tarkovsky is in the ""room"" where I just started to knock. You should see this movie if you want to know what is real you and what you really want. The movie is not the answer, but it is the step to your new understanding of your life.",Solaris
393,Solaris,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0126125/,"Two truths drive this film: the inadequacy of human-kind to understand the Universe, and the inadequacy of human-kind to understand the human heart.As such, using Lem's original idea, Tarkovsky successfully, explores these themes.We are drawn in, through hauntingly beautiful imagery, to the internal struggles of Kris Kelvin as he attempts to understand feelings of love for his suicided wife, who has been mysteriously resurrected, presumably as an attempt by Solaris to communicate, or torture.Of course Solaris is probably the most original alien ever concocted, (no phone-homes here) and as must be, utterly enigmatic and beyond communication.Be warned, this film is very long, and sometimes slow, but for those who consider themselves science fiction addicts, it is a must view.One of the top 5 sci-fi films of all time.",Solaris
394,Le Samouraï,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1470091/,"The ""auteur"" of this turkey decided to make a film noir starring Alain Delon.

Even 21st century movies aimed at 15-year-old males, that depend on special effects and car chases, don't have as many illogical and just nutty plot elements as this one. Why does the inspector suspect Jef, when there is no reason for it? Why does Jef wear the same hat and trench coat in which he committed the murder, afterward? How do the police know about the card game where they pick him up, and why do they bother to raid it? Why does the evil mastermind want to, or need to, pay Jef two million francs (more or less US $750 k to 1 million in 2006 prices!!! -- or were they still counting in old francs in 67, which would make the sum ridiculously small) to kill the beautiful pianist? Just what is it about the bird's behavior that tells Jef that his apartment has been visited, and how is it that Jef understands this? Does he have a PhD in ornithologic psych? Why is it so notable that Jef knows the Paris metro so well; it's the easiest thing in the world to figure out even for a tourist who doesn't speak French.

395,Cool Hand Luke,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3633507/,"On the face of it, Cool Hand Luke tells a simplistic story about a guy who breaks the law and is sent to a rural prison, where he must earn status among the prisoners. This in turn sets him against the guards and governor, who want nothing better than to knock him down, and the plot goes from there.Where this film excels is in its depth. It can be read in a number of different ways, from example as a religious allegory and also in terms of status and power in the modern age. In essence there's a microcosm of society inside the prison with each character fulfilling a different role or tier. Paul Newman plays the classic rebellious character, a man unwilling to conform, ever, and he does it in such a brilliant way that I'm surprised he didn't win his Oscar.Newman's the perfect fit for the part: upbeat, funny, and incredibly sympathetic. I haven't seen all of his films, but I find it hard to imagine he could better his role here. Equalling him is George Kennedy, also at his best, and fully deserving his best supporting actor Oscar. His character is perfectly written and, indeed, this film is perfectly made, with great attention to visual detail throughout. It's also notable for featuring a number of classic sequences, from the egg eating to the 'Plastic Jesus' song and of course the escape attempts. A fantastic film indeed.",Cool Hand Luke
396,Persona,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1114040/,"To quote Colin Mochrie of Whose Line is it Anyway, ""it's CRAP""!!! To put this into perspective, I love foreign films--and I'd rather see them than most Hollywood films. I have seen perhaps as many as two thousand foreign films--and most of the ""must see"" films of directors such as Bergman, Truffaut, De Sica, Kurasawa, Fellini, Bunuel, etc. So, my strong opinion is not without some experience--I am not just some jerk who knocks Bergman's films because they don't have explosions or toga parties!!!! My contention is that SOME of this wonderful directors (or at least some of their films) are incredibly overrated, and are seemingly above criticism. Well, not from me--I love to stir the pot of controversy and call it like I see it. Check out some of my other reviews--I had ADORED some foreign films (such as The Umbrellas of Cherbourg) or directors (Akira Kurasawa) yet been unimpressed by other films (Such as several of Fellini's films--Satyricon and Juliet of the Spirits).So, on to Bergman. My favorite film he made is The Seventh Seal. It wasn't exactly my favorite when I first watched it, but found that the more I thought about it (with its originality and intense performances), the more I was impressed. Scenes from a Marriage, Through a Glass Darkly, Fanny and Alexander and other movies of his were excellent, but not great films, as they had flaws which prevented them getting higher ratings.Persona is the only Bergman film which I gave a really BAD rating. It is hopelessly bleak, choppy (when it purports to be artsy by including repellent seemingly random images in portions of the movie) and silly. The mentally ill central character (Liv Ullmann) does not talk throughout the movie but the dialog is spoken by her nurse (Bibi Andersson)--who increasingly becomes irritated with Ullmann for her silence. I felt much the same way about half way through the film. All this excitement(?) is set in a seaside vacation home. I guess many found it shocking or sophisticated--all I felt was bored and amazed with how unimpressive the film was.So, maybe you should see it for yourself and make your own decision. Maybe all the critics are right and I am just a hopeless crank! My wife would tend to agree (that I am a bit of a crank, that is)!!",Persona

398,Andrei Rublev,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0092146/,"Andrei Rublev (alternately transliterated as Andrei Rublyov) is an epic film created by the Soviet-era director, Andrei Tarkovsky. It was financed and created during a brief cultural thaw in East-West relations, marked by the end of Kruschchev's reign. Within reason, the 205 minute director's cut represents exactly what Tarkovsky wanted in the movie. Unfortunately for Tarkovsky and for us, Kruschev was deposed shortly after filming began, and the 205 minute version was not seen until twenty five years after its creation. The Breszhnev-era censors first trimmed 15 minutes from it, then censors and marketers trimmed more. The shortest known version has been truncated to 145 minutes. Even more sadly, Tarkovsky was never again to get approval for the projects he really wanted to film, or an adequate budget to film the ones that did get approved.Fortunately for us, this movie, recently rereleased in a DVD transferred from a pristine 35mm print, may now be viewed intact, and it is one of the great triumphs of mankind's stay on the planet. It is a masterpiece almost without flaw. The beautiful painterly images follow one another in breathtaking succession. At least three of the eight chapters, if taken individually, could stand alone as separate masterpieces.The ostensible subject is the life of Andrei Rublev, a 15th century monk who is renowned as Russia's greatest creator of religious icons and frescoes. Rublev himself, however, is merely a useful device. Little is known about him, and most of the episodes in the movie come straight from Tarkovsky's imagination of what might have been. Sometimes one must ignore the facts to get to the truth.The movie is not about one talented monk, but about Russia, and Rublev stands in as a useful symbol since he lived in a time when he could personally witness two of the key elements in the development of Russia's unique culture: the growing force of Byzantine Christianity, and the Mongol-Tatar invasions. In addition he was an artist and a thinker, and experienced first-hand the difficulty of following those paths in Russia. Rublev's own inner conflicts allow the filmmaker to illuminate thoughts on the pagan and the sacred, the nature of art, the relationship of the artist to the state, what it means to be Russian, and what it means to be human.It is beautiful, mystical, and profound, but the truly inspiring aesthetics are matched with complete technical wizardry. I simply don't know how some of the shots were created. One I do understand, and stand in awe of, is a continuous single camera shot, just before the church door is breached by Tatar invaders, which involves action in several different locations at multiple elevations as well as the correct timing of hundreds of extras and horses. It makes the first scene of Touch of Evil look like a high school film project.It is a difficult movie to follow. One might liken it to James Joyce's Finnegan's Wake as a work of genius so monumental and complex, and so disdainful of traditional narrative form, that it requires extensive thought and study to understand it. And even after studying it, watching it repeatedly, and reading Tarkovsky's own comments about it, one still finds it opaque in many ways.Tarkovsky was free to create the work of art he wanted, without concern for profit. The original 205 minute cut was also free from outside censorship. He used this freedom to realize his personal artistic vision. There is no other movie like it, and there may never be. Score it 11 out of 10.",Andrei Rublev
399,The Battle of Algiers,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6191544/,"The list of those who signed the 'Manifesto of the 121' of September 1960 calling upon the French government to recognise Algeria's right to independence is impressive indeed. One of the lesser known signatories is Jean Martin, an actor who had fought in the French Resistance and served as a paratrooper in Indochina. Putting his name to the Manifesto cost him his job at the Theatre National Populaire.
Supremely ironic that six years later he was to be cast by Gillo Pontecorvo as Colonel Mathieu who is assigned the task of crushing Algerian insurgency. Ironic also is the supposed difficulty experienced by the director in toning down Martin's performance so that he would not stand out among the cast of non-professionals.
One of the high profile signatories was Jean-Paul Sartre who is cleverly referred to in the film. When Mathieu is asked by a journalist if he likes Sartre he replies: ""Not really, but I like him even less as an opponent"".
To the average cinema-goer the length and content of this film are daunting to say the least whereas to those who recognise film as the seventh art it is an undisputed masterpiece. Essential of course to have one's moral compass handy for although Pontecorvo claimed he had made a 'politically neutral' film, as an avowed Marxist there is absolutely no doubt as to where his sympathies lay and its undeniable influence on the tactics of terrorist groups has guaranteed its controversial status.
Inspired by the memoirs of Saadi Jacef who appears in the film as a FLN leader, this is shot in a neo-realist, semi-documentary style strongly reminiscent of Rossellini's 'Rome, open City'.
Technically it is nigh on faultless with its haunting soundtrack, composition of shots, superb editing and one of Ennio Morricone's most evocative scores.
It has been consistently praised by critics, heaped with awards and made a deep impression on directors, notably Stanley Kubrick.
Historically of course it has cast an even greater shadow as nations are forced to come to terms with and face the consequences of their colonial past.
There is a scene in which a political prisoner on his way to the guillotine cries out 'God is great!' These were the words recently used by an Islamist whilst slicing off the head of a French schoolteacher.",The Battle of Algiers
400,The Exterminating Angel,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2594174/,"'L'enfer c'est les autres' (Hell is other people), wrote the French existentialist philosopher, Jean-Paul Sartre, in his play, 'No Exit' (sometimes referred to - and has been performed - as 'In Camera'), that surmised the narrative of three deceased individuals locked in a room, one that they eventually realise they will be spending eternity together in. Luis Bunuel used this simple meta-narrative concept of people trapped, to create one of his finest satires, and his first explicitly surrealist film since L'Age D'Or (1930). After Bunuel's previous film, Viridiana (1961), was condemned by the Vatican and banned in his native country of Spain (and where it was made), he moved back to Mexico where he had been making films throughout the 1940's and 50's, and produced a scabrous attack on General Francisco Franco's Spanish fascist dictatorship, and the institutions, and bourgeois facets of the country that were founded on the destruction of the poor and the proletariat, during the civil war that ended in 1939.Whilst the film works as political allegory, on a base narrative level, it functions as an irrational comedy; or farce. The guests arrive for a lavish dinner, but as they arrive, the maids leave, and progressively all the hired help leave them. Once dinner is complete, the guests congregate in the living room, but they all begin to realise that they are unable to leave the room at all. When this is discovered we observe that they attempt to go, but are either distracted or simply stop or break down at the boundary of the room. This continues through days, possibly months - the characters concept of time completely obliterated. The group falls into decay, primitive urges overwhelm them, and as this representation of Western Civilisation breaks down, the group become brutally savage, turning on the host of the dinner, demanding sacrifice. The group slaughter the lambs that were originally to be used in a dinner prank.At first the guests seem to simply ignore what is happening to them, and continue with inane chat. Exterior to the ""party"", the grounds are surrounded, but not even the police are able to enter, given the same mysterious barrier that prevents entry. It's almost a perfect parable, illustrating the ignorance of the Spanish bourgeoisie, as they strip the rights and dignity of the proletariat (here the maids leave on their arrival), whilst divorcing their minds from the violence and corruption of a dictatorship. But with this, it also shows how even the ""civilised"" sections of society, once they are stripped of their social status, their inherited manners of ""education"", and their ability to use wealth, the fall into absolute decay, probably falling apart greater than the lower classes, with their lessened moral outlook, and an almost infantile inability to deal with regular obstacles.Winner of the 1962 Palme d'Or at the Cannes film festival, this was to begin what become (rather belatedly for the 62 year old) his most productive, celebrated and interesting period of his career, based in Paris, beginning with Belle de Jour (1967) and ending with That Obscure Object of Desire (1977). This is the period that he developed and expanded his own style, and his unique vision on film. The Exterminating Angel has also given inspiration for others. It is a clear influence on Jean-Luc Godard's wonderfully bleak and satiric depiction of the bourgeoisie and the end of Western Civilisation, Week End (1967). The idea was also utilised in one sketch from Monty Python's Meaning of Life (1983), that saw the guests leaving as ghosts. This is by far, one of his greatest achievements, beautifully realised, with comic touches, and moments of surrealism that both bemuse and amuse.www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com",The Exterminating Angel
401,The Exterminating Angel,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0079963/,"That was what Luis Bunuel used to answer when asked about the meaning of one of his least accessible works.Much less linear than ""Viridiana"" -featuring the same actress Silvia Pinal-which precedes it,""El Angel exterminador"" can be looked upon as an allegory.We find a lot of permanent features of the Bunuel canon in it though.The fact that the guests cannot leave the luxury house will find an equivalent in ""le charme discret de la bourgeoisie""(1972) when the five characters cannot have a good meal at the restaurant;the guests turning like lions in a cage echo to this strange picture of the five heroes of ""charme discret"" walking on an endless road.This is the kind of movie that will have as many interpretations as there are users writing about it.And Bunuel would probably be the first to say that anyone is allowed to see his movie as he feels it in his soul -which is a word he would not certainly approve of though.Another put-down of the bourgeoisie ,probably;As Charlie Chaplin would not have let an ice-cream fall on a poor woman's dress,Bunuel's wholesale massacre concerns the rich,the well-to-do.The house may be a metaphor for their world which they want to keep exactly as it is.But Bunuel soon scratches the varnish and after long hours,his powerful bourgeois are just men and rather hateful selfish cowards -the scene when they rush to get a glass of water.And as they cannot rely on themselves and on their pals,the only assistance can only come from above:so they promise God they will chant Te Deums, they will go to Lourdes and buy a washable rubber Virgin (sic).Surrealist pictures,which had been absent since ""cela s'appelle l'aurore"" (1955) come back for a while during one night,and they mainly deal with religion and heaven.The mystery of the night hours will come back in ""le fantôme de la liberté"" (1974)The last pictures bring the missing link :the army ,shooting people (talking about a revolution?) ,as the bourgeois keep on singing(?) and praying(?)in the cathedral.Recommended?Everything Bunuel did is crying to be watched.",El Angel Exterminador
402,What Ever Happened to Baby Jane?,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0079826/,"I recently viewed this film with a friend who had never seen it before. Much to my surprise, we had to turn it off early because this friend actually found Whatever Happened to Baby Jane? boring.   
I'll admit that Whatever Happened to Baby Jane? is a dated piece of work. By today's standards, there is no shock value.  The actresses are not well known by the younger crowds out there.  There is a lot of dialogue and very little action. It simply doesn't fit in with today's expectations of horror and suspense.  So why does it hold up as a great film, at least by my standards and by the standards of so many others?To truly appreciate this film, it would be necessary to understand the background.  What actually contributed to the making of this film is what I find truly fascinating.  The story itself is about two elderly sisters.  One, Baby Jane, (played by Bette Davis) was a child star in the early part of the century.  She was hugely popular on the vaudeville circuit. Backstage she was a spoiled brat. Later on in life the other sister, Blanche (played by Joan Crawford) became a popular Hollywood movie star, overshadowing her now 'has-been' sister.  A supposed car accident leaves Blanche crippled during the height of her popularity and a crazed Jane is left to care for her.In their later life Blanche is confined to her bedroom and Jane, still donning the make up and curls from her childhood runs the house.  Jane still believes she can resurect her career, but is tormented by her sisters continued popularity as her films are rerun on television.There are some fabulous lines throughout the movie that have become legendary.  Blanche says, ""You couldn't do this to me if I wasn't in this wheel chair.'  Jane quips ""But ya are Blanche, but ya are.""Davis plays Jane to the hilt, looking hysterically eerie as she tortures Crawford's stoic Blanche.  My kid sister saw this film after seeing Mommie Dearest and aptly stated that this was just dessert for a woman who beat her children so badly.  I think my sister was most impressed when Davis kicks Joan in the stomach.  ""Take that Mommie Dearest!""Back to my original point, I believe that in order to truly appreciate this story, one must appreciate the behind-the-scenes legend that truly is the essence of this film.  Davis and Crawford were, and are, two of the most formidable actresses in Hollywood.  Between them there are hundreds of films, three Oscars, and countless tidbits of gossip.  Both had to claw and chew their way to the top, and had to fight harder to stay there.  They both had stormy relationships, and bitter feuds with studio bosses and directors. And both have a legion of fans that have survived long after they did.  And of course, lets not forget the fact that they may have despised each other. There is a fantastic book called Bette and Joan (I can't recall the author's name) that I recommend any novice viewer read prior to viewing this film. In it, the lives of these two remarkable women are described in gossipy detail.  A lot of time is spent detailing the making of this film. At the time Joan was pushing her husbands company, Pepsi.  It was rumored, perhaps by Bette that her Pepsi bottles were half filled with vodka.  Bette also complains vehemently about the size of Joan's fake cleavage, and how they got in the way of some of those scenes.  It's even suggested that some of those beatings that Joan took from Bette were real.

403,What Ever Happened to Baby Jane?,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3690196/,"Ryan Murphy's series ""Feud"" in which Jessica Lange and Susan Sarandon play Joan Crawford and Bette Davis at the time of Baby Jane and beyond. I got so engrossed the series that I had to see What Ever Happened To Baby Jane again. Wow! Now, it all feels slightly different, less campy more poignant. Joan Crawford as played by Jessica Lange - the best performance by an actress in many, many years - is a totally recognizable person, crazy or not. When George Cukor tries to convince Joan not to be so vindictive ""you're better than this Joan"" to what Crawford/Lange replies: ""No George, I'm not"" Fantastic!

404,Sanjuro,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1053855/,"Akira Kurosawa and Toshiro Mifune combined their abilities in numerous fine movies, and while ""Sanjuro"", for its part, is lighter than most of the others, it is certainly one of the most entertaining of the movies that either of the two has made. Mifune gets a role that allows him to get many good moments, and it's also a role that he must have enjoyed playing.The story is quite interesting, with many good turns and a way of keeping you guessing as to what will happen next. Mifune plays a samurai who takes it upon himself to try to save a rather hapless but nevertheless worthy clan from government conspiracy and from its own foolishness. It's a role that gives him both plenty of good lines and plenty of good action sequences. Kurosawa, of course, knows just how to get the most out of all of the material, and the story also provides some interesting psychological insights on the characters.The settings are very good, and they are often used in creative ways in telling the story. Except for Mifune's character, most of the other characters are fairly one-dimensional, but they are believable, and they also allow plenty of room for Mifune to get the most out of each of his scenes. The result is a very enjoyable and well-crafted movie.",Sanjuro
405,The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0078400/,"Other reviewers, aside from seeing this as the end of the classic western, saw the plot as myth granting to one man that which was rightfully another's. I disagree. I see TMWSLV as a tale of a man stepping aside for the sake of a better man and a better world, at great personal cost.I view Tom as someone who has lived a cynical life--kill it before it kills you. With the advent of Ransom he recognizes that there is a better way, and that Ransom, by defying evil from a position of weakness, is far braver than Tom, who has merely defied evil from a position of strength. Additionally, Ransom brings about an answer to the question ""must the sword rule forever?"" with a resounding ""no,"" a denial that at first seems foolish to Tom, but who then realizes that things really should be Ransom's way.And so Tom, knowing that one of them is the better man, allows that better man to receive the fame attendant to heroism; and in fact Ransom, for daring what Tom never did dare, is the true hero of the tale. Like all honest men must, Tom steps aside for the better man, knowing what it will cost him to do what is right.An earlier reviewer said that the depiction of the politics was a parody; in fact, the politics of the early portion of the republics was even more lively (read: pugnacious) than is depicted in the film.",N/A

Unfortunately, the drama or suspense is not very gripping. This is as simple as I can put it. Film buffs will probably love this movie. It's crafted like a work of art. The average moviegoer will probably be bored during the film. This film kind of defies convention and rating. I thought it was well- made, I just thought it wasn't very engaging.",Ivan's Childhood
407,Ivan's Childhood,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1657123/,"""Childhood of Ivan"" is not only about Ivan's life but it stands as a symbol for the many Russian lives shattered by the war. This is an elliptical film, that is, it doesn't reveal everything - it suggests.""Childhood of Ivan"" requires the use of your brain and imagination, but it is in no way a difficult film. Once you accept not understanding everything right now, just relax and follow the images and sounds and you are ready for the ""Childhood of Ivan"". As I said before the film uses many ellipses to show Ivan's fractured life - he plays in the fields, his mother calls him and smiles; a water well, he stares down at the water and his mother stands beside him and tells a story about the stars; we hear a gun shot, someone lying on the grass; Ivan is wading through a swamp to reach a soviet army unit.The war is not shown at all - it is suggested. We only see the enemy soldiers once for a brief moment. And two hanged men is all there is to denounce the carnage of the war. The rest is suggested by unfinished speeches, by faces where pain is followed right after by the desire to live and be happy......Ivan's memories: His mother, his sister and their games, the beach, the sea and the rain, his captivity - his life, a broken life. Nothing remained for him in life but to fight - to fight against the enemy that had taken everything from him.I repeat that ""Childhood of Ivan"" is not a partisan film, it doesn't try to demonize the adversaries. I would call it much more an intimist film, somewhat in the vein of ""Les Jeux Interdits"", but Ivan's childhood was over after the horrors he had to go through; his only way to survive as a human being was to fight the horror that had crippled his life, while the children of ""Les Jeux Interdits"" went on with their children games in spite of the war. France, because of her fast surrender, was preserved from the butchery inflicted on the Soviet Union.I recommend this film to everyone who wants to see a paradoxically sad, beautiful, reflexive and passionate film.",N/A
408,The Virgin Spring,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1279013/,"Director: Igmar Bergman, Script: Ulla Isaksson, Cast: Max Von Sydow (Tore), Birgitta Valberg (Mareta), Gunnel Lindblom (Ingeri), Brigitta Pettersson (Karin), Axel Duberg (herdsman), Tor Isedal(mute herdsman), Ove Porath (boy) Midieval tale about a wealthy Sweedish family. They send their privileged and rather spoiled daughter on a journey to the church to deliver candles as an offering for the virgin mother. Her less fortunate pregnant step sister is asked to go along. While on their journey, the step sister develops a fear of the forest and also complains of being sick. Karin,the privileged daughter, has her stay with a hermit in the forest while she continues the journey alone. Along the way she runs into a three goatherds,two man and a young boy who are brothers. They complain of being hungry due to their long journey so out of kindness, she offers to picnic with them in which she shares her bread with them. The two man proceed to rape her and then kill her while the young boy watches helpless. Her step sister had left the cabin where she was staying and witnessed the whole thing but did nothing to help Karin. By chance, the three brothers turn up at Karin's parents farm. The herdsman tries to sell Karin's valuable garments that they had removed from her to her mother. This leads the father to take revenge on the herdsman.This is a film I would strongly recommend to anyone especially lovers of classic cinema. The only other Bergman film I have seen is The Seventh Seal which is also outstanding. This film was extremely troubling to me not only because of the brutal act but also because Karin did not deserve this. We have a young innocent naive girl whose trust was betrayed. In this film we see the dynamics of these two sisters. Karin was privileged and spoiled by her parents especially her mother. Her father is more stern but she is still able to break him down with her charm. The step sister is of a much lower stature. She works as a servant and farm hand while Karin doesn't have to do any work. As a result, the step sister has a strong resentment toward Karin. Unlike the Cinderella storey, Karin is very kind to Ingeri, her step sister. She is also very concerned for her as a result of her being pregnant. When she comes across the herdsman, being from the wealthy upper class, she could have easily blown them off but instead she spends time with them and offers them her food only to get violated and murdered in return. In actuality, seeing three men(while two men and a boy) in the forest should have caused her to run away. As an example of her gullibility, right before she is about to be raped, the men say things like ""what white hands you have"" and she replies buy saying something to the likes of ""because a princess never has to work"" then they proceed by saying ""What a lovely neck you have"" while sitting very close to her. She than says something to the likes of (I am going to be way off here!) ""how else can a lovely princes wear her bracelets"". She then goes on to tell them about their farm and her well to do life. She is not saying all this in a stuck up way trying to brag. Again she is a very naive girl who has lived like a princes. She expects the men to share her enthusiasm! The step sister did not do anything possibly out of resentment to her step sister or it could have been out of fear. When the herdsman arrive at Karin's parents farm and her father finds out what they have done to Karin, he kills them including the boy. This is another very tragic part of the movie. Like Karin, the boy was also innocent. He had nothing to do with the rape and murder of Karin. One could argue that he could have stopped his brothers instead of just watching. In reality, their is absolutely nothing he could have done. His older brothers are grown men while he is just a small boy. As a matter of fact, they physically abuse him. Not only is the boy a victim like Karin but he is also an outcast like Ingeri, the step sister. He is treated bad by his brothers and Ingeri is treated bad by her family although not by Karin. After Tore,the father, kills the two man and goes after the boy, he runs to Mareta, the mother, for protection. She tries to protect him from Tore but is unable to do so and the father proceeds to kill him.Tore immediately feels remorse for what he had done. The parents and farm hands go to find Karin's body led by Ingeri. When Mareta lifts Karins body from the ground, a spring arises from the site. Tore vows to God to build a church there.",The Virgin Spring
409,The Virgin Spring,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1175825/,"I have to agree with the previous comment, this is certainly a sad film I would go further, it's actually a grim little tale. Bergman pulls no punches, the medaeval world he shows is a hard, harsh, bleak place. There is a sense of menace in almost every scene and the actual rape is graphic and nearly unwatchable. The characters are not finely drawn, but after all this is a fairy tale in the older mould. They are there to represent types and conditions. The sad, doting mother; the unbending Christian gentleman; the flawed cleric; the ferocious, deceitful rapist-murderers. The tale on one level is very simple and can be simply followed; jealous sister curses more favoured sister, favoured sister is cruelly killed, killers ironically claim refuge of her father, father exacts revenge on them. So far we have something that could have come out of many a European ballad tradition. However, on another level it contains fundamental comments on humanity and human behaviour, Christian moral theology and our reaction to it. The father's faith is tested, he is not the man he thinks he is and his religion is not what he thinks it is either, though he submits and adopts a position of blind hope. The killers represent the complete absence of good that Aquinas maintained was the definition of evil. The young brother is the pain of conscience. In many ways it is a play on the deadly sins, apart from gluttony they are all there; wrath on the part of the father and pride in his daughter; envy in the half-sister; lust and avarice in the herdsmen and so on. It is truly an exemplary tale, as a medaeval legend should be. I bought this film casually at a street stall in Taipei for an absurdly small amount of money and it lay on a shelf unwatched for quite some time. In a bored moment one night I slipped it in the player and found myself enthralled until the finish. The cinematography, of course, is excellent but the joy is the dark threat that filigrees it, the simple but powerful emotions both quietly and violently displayed. It lacks the grandeur of ""The Seventh Seal"". It's a smaller and more compact number but it some ways the better for it, the evocations are more direct and the violence unnerving. I recommend it very highly indeed, you will be thinking on its themes long after this simple little tale finishes.",N/A

412,The 400 Blows,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3703102/,"One of the defining films of its director François Truffaut as well as the French New Wave movement. The latter was a loose term joining together a group of mid-century French film makers that took upon as their goal to talk about current subjects, to experiment with the film medium and to ground it in reality through real locations and modern subject matters.And keeping that in mind, it's easy to see why this film become such a cornerstone for them. It tells about a young Parisian school boy Antoine Doinel (Jean-Pierre Léaud), who struggles in every area of his life. His parents heap both scorn and misunderstandings upon him, his school work barely passes muster, and he spends most of his days partaking in minor crimes and misdemeanours. The film doesn't really have a traditional story arc. Doinel doesn't learn that much, his circumstances don't really change. Rather the whole film has the atmosphere of the inevitable in it as Doinel's life slowly spirals deeper and deeper into ruin, culminating in the last haunting shot of him staring directly into the camera on a deserted beach, silently crying for rescue.And yes, the film has a rather gruff feel. It seems like they simply set up the camera, shot the scene and excited the room. Which of course is the ideal of New Wave, but takes some getting used to from a viewer more familiar with mainstream film media.Still, it's a beautiful film in its own way. Personally I appreciate the ideal it represents more than I appreciate it as a stand-alone film, but I'm still glad I saw it.",The 400 Blows
413,Ben-Hur,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3589079/,"The newest iteration of BEN-HUR (2016) made by schlockmeister Timur Bekmambetov crashed and burned in the box-office front, which prompts my belated viewing of this grandiose historical epic under the supervision of William Wyler, the film won him a third Oscar for directing and swept with 11 wins out of its total 12 nominations (only Karl Tunberg lost BEST ADAPTED SCREENPLAY to Jack Clayton's ROOM AT THE TOP).Adapted from Lew Wallace's 1880 novel, BEN-HUR: A TALE OF THE Christ, this Hollywood juggernaut opens with the birth of Jesus Christ, jand condones quite a chunk of time in padding out the Calvary crucification after the iconic chariot racing money shot (which partially explains its drawn-out length, running up to 212 minutes), vehemently gets its feet wet as a Christianity- moralizing tale by casting J.C. as the Messiah who literally saves our hero Judas Ben-Hur (Heston) from perishing during his trials and tribulations, and jumps the shark in its miraculous ending, gratifyingly throws humankind's fate under the omnipresence's whims, which gives a staid aftertaste. The main plot is of course, about Judas, a wealthy Jewish prince in Jerusalem, AD 26, falls foul of his childhood friend, now a Roman tribune, Messala (Boyd), who swears allegiance to the Roman Empire, and fails to rope the freedom-advocating Judas into joining his side. Under Messala's cunning malfeasance out of a mere accident, Judas is sentenced to toil in the galleys whilst his mother Miriam (Scott) and sister Tirzah (O'Connell) are cooped up in prison. Revenge is the mainspring behind Judas' odyssey from a galley slave to an heir of the childless Roman Consul Quintus Arrius (Hawkins), it is hatred that keeps his head above water against adversity, alert to a golden window to enact his exit strategy and he even magnanimously hatches a son-father rapport with the tyrannical Arrius. This is the thorny knot in the otherwise rather Manichaean racial feud depicted in the story, how far one can go to love your enemy? Which remains a quintessential challenge for those who endorse Christianity, and the film could have delved deeper into Judas' psyche on that issue, yet, Arrius wholly disappears from the narrative after the mid-stream, and he merely functions as a springboard to Judas' glorious homecoming with his rehabilitation, reunion and rediscovery. At the end of the day, justice belatedly prevails, but Judas still gets all shaken up in the aftermath, revenge might keep him alive but it is religion that gives him the ultimate peace.For what it's worth, BEN-HUR's visual spectacle still holds water to an awe-inspiring amazement and thrill, it is a historic accomplishment not just because of its cutting-edge technicalities but also for the staggering manpower it strenuously deploys, the film itself is a panegyric of human's creativity, which is something no dissenter can take away. Romans are played by a crop of top-notch British thespians, whilst Jews are mostly impersonated by Americans, although how come Hugh Griffith's ludicrously swarthy portrayal of the Arabic Sheik can walk off with that Oscar statute still eludes me, he is not even the top-pick among the supporting cast in the film, both Hawkins and Boyd can easily upstage him with their more engaging agent and emotive bravura, especially the latter, truly deserves at least an Oscar nomination which usurped by Griffith. That is not to say, Heston wins his Oscar all fair and square, but at least one can understand the logic, Heston has a dominating role whacked by an unimaginable baptism of fire, he is undeniably sympathetic and mostly affective with a very theatrical flair. An unsung heroine, is Israeli beauty Haya Harareet's divine presence as Esther, the daughter of Judah's former slave Simonides (Jaffe), and Judah's sweetheart, who livens up the scenes whenever poignancy comes into play, a classic godsend. When all is said and done, BEN-HUR is the apotheosis of mainstream studio production in Hollywood's Golden Era, its phenomenal scale, its breathtaking grandeur and the imposingly plangent score by Miklós Rózsa can unnerve any redux project even tries to emulate its success, and furthermore, its ""revenge is never the cure"" message can earnestly transcend any religious persuasions and reach to a broader demography out of its faith-base home-turf.",Ben-Hur
414,Ben-Hur,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3355127/,"When I first saw 'Ben Hur' I was 8 years old and hadn't seen many films, since we were hardly ever allowed to watch television. Imagine what an impact this film had on me (my movie diet had so far consisted of Chaplin and Disney films - which, of course, is not at all a bad thing).The experience was simply mesmerizing. Awe and wonder filled me as I watched this story of shocking betrayal, revenge and forgiveness unfold on screen - and by the time the heart-stopping chariot race was over, my fate as a future movie addict was sealed. Despite its 212 minutes running time, this is storytelling at its finest that knows how to entertain; as we follow Judah Ben-Hur's dramatic journey from Jerusalem to Rome and back again, the film just never lets up and immerses you completely.It's hard to imagine anything more cinematic, especially at the time: if ever there was an epic that was meant to be seen on the big screen in all its bombastic glory, it's Ben Hur. And even now, after I've seen the film many, many times, I feel like this story has a certain sense of greatness to it that is touching (and I don't mean that in a religious sense).My verdict: this film was and is nothing like the many ""sandal and sword"" or bible films of that era; it is (at least to me) the ultimate film epic. With its touching story and fantastic action sequences - which I think hold up amazingly well - Ben Hur is among the milestones of its era and part of film history.Pure cinema and a must see. 10 stars out of 10.Favorite TV-Shows reviewed: imdb.com/list/ls075552387/Favorite films: IMDb.com/list/mkjOKvqlSBs/Lesser-Known Masterpieces: imdb.com/list/ls070242495/Favorite Low-Budget and B-Movies: imdb.com/list/ls054808375/",Ben Hur

Fellini's ""Le Notti di Cabiria"" is one of those movies that seems to grow with me. It grows richer with each yearly viewing. I never tire of it; I am moved in different ways each time I see it. Fellini and his amazing muse, Giulietta Masina, created one of those rare movie masterpieces in 1957 that comments on its time, yet remains fresh and contemporary as well. But I lament that this gem is so little known today. I trust its recent restoration will help remedy the movie-going public's oversight.

Of all his characters, Fellini once said, Cabiria was the only one he was still worried about. Of all the characters, I've seen in the films, Cabiria is the one I often think about - what ever happened to her? Did she survive? Was she able to find love? I've never seen the face so alive, changing its expression every moment. If the face is the soul's mirror, Cabiria's (Masina's) face reflects her every single emotion and how effortlessly she goes from bitter cynicism to wistful yearning, from despair to hope, from tears to smile. While there's life there's hope. As long as Cabiria smiles in the end of this tragicomic masterpiece, there is hope for all of us.",Nights of Cabiria

I have seen a number of Kurosawa's most notable films, but I believe this is superior. Indeed, I believed I was watching what must be one of the most influential horror films of all time interwoven with a sweeping epic, all in under two hours. If Edgar Allen Poe directed Macbeth, this is something of what it would feel like. Yamada and Mifune have some of the most brilliant scenes of non-romantic tension between a man and a woman I can recall- everything in these scenes is perfect because there is emptiness in every element, nothing unnecessary or light exists. In school, Macbeth was always my least favorite tragedy, perhaps because we lack the belief in the supernatural and the relationship with death to be horrified by such dialogue and such people, and this film struck a chord with English-speaking audiences because it expresses the essence of all that far better to us.",N/A
419,Throne of Blood,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0061615/,"Washizu is a brave samurai who helps his lord to fight off a violent rebellion.  Washizu and his friend Miki are riding through Cobweb Forest when a spirit appears to them and makes predictions which fire their ambitions.  When Washizu explains this vision to his wife Asaji, she urges him to murder his lord and rule in his stead.  Thus the tragedy begins.Kurosawa's interpretation of Macbeth is visually fascinating. Swirling mist, colossal trees dripping with rain, rich black volcanic soil and bulky fortress architecture provide the imposing, dread-laden backdrop against which the humans move in superbly stylized patterns.  The director chose to shoot the action on Mount Fuji precisely because of the volcanic soil - and even had truckloads brought to the studio for pickup shots.Westerners unfamiliar with Noh are missing a huge part of the film's meaning.  This thousand-year-old theatrical tradition corresponds broadly to our Elizabethan Tragedy, and Kurosawa shows how the two cultural strains, eastern and western, interlock and interact.  The one illumines the other.The Noh stage must have on it three pine branches and a symbolic Shinto temple-arch.  In the film, shots are carefully composed to include tangles of branches in the foreground, and the vast entrance gate of Washizu's fortress serves for the temple arch.  And yet Kurosawa is not including these details redundantly, for mere form's sake - the ubiquitous branches, framing the human action, remind us all the time of the forest nemesis awaiting Washizu.  The arch is Washizu's interface with the world - open in the early stages, but gradually less so as the protagonist retreats into his own diseased inner self.A Noh play features a ""doer"" (Shite) and a ""companion"" (Waku) who plays a subordinate role.  Washizu and Asaji are the Shite and Waku respectively. Elements in the Noh include a battle-drama (we get one here) and a so-called ""wig drama"", in which a female character dominates the action.  This is the central portion of the film, in the quiet of the fortress quarters, when Asaji ruthlessly manipulates her husband's ambition.  Every Noh play has a ghost which appears to the Shite, and the spirit in the forest fulfils that function.  Noh plays are never original works, in that (by a venerable convention) they are re-workings of ancient legends.  Kurosawa follows tradition by quarrying his tale from Shakespeare's play.There is no western term to describe the stylized striking of poses so important in Noh.  Our word ""dance"" is a crude word which approximates to, but does not convey, the grace of the Japanese art-form.  Asaji, alone with the blood-stain, gives us a glimpse of this delightful ritual.Finally, Noh contains an aural richness almost totally absent from western tragedy - the complex rhythms of stamping and percussion which accompany the spoken word.  In the film, the rhythmic patterns of horses' hooves on soil, and Washizu's bare feet on the boards of the banquet hall, are meant to reinforce the mood as they creep into our emotions by subliminal insistence.Isuzu Yamada is terrific as Asaji.  Her stillness absolutely oozes determination, contrasting strongly with her husband's hollow bluster.
It seems that Kurosawa cherished the concept of a Noh Macbeth for some years before committing it to celluloid.  Apparently the project had to be scrapped in 1952 because Welles' Macbeth was nearing completion, and Kurosawa did not want the two films to suffer by being endlessly compared. This version, then, had to wait until 1957 to be realised.The director is not afraid to add his own flourishes to the well-known story.  We hear of the notorious traitor Fujimaki who disembowelled himself in a room of the fortress.  The exact spot is now known as the Forbidden Room, a place of evil omen with its indelible bloodstain on the floor.  It is a symbol which encapsulates the spirit of the film, interweaving the related themes of treachery, blood and guilt.  In a brilliant transition, we are taken to a change of scene by the ripping down of a banner by galloping horsemen.  Washizu at the pinnacle of his arrogance is filmed from below with severe foreshortening, conveying his vainglory more effectively than words ever could.

What a year of great films: 12 ANGRY MEN, PATHS OF GLORY, SWEET SMELL OF SUCCESS, GUNFIGHT AT THE OK CORRAL, and this film, THE BRIDGE ON THE RIVER KWAI. Sometimes, I think that 1957 gets forgotten as being one of the great years of films and that's a shame. BRIDGE won Best Picture in this year, one of the very few in film history that I think is at least deserving. That said, PATHS OF GLORY is amongst the top 10 films of all time as far as I'm concerned, but I don't think it was released immediately in the U.S. in 1957, so I can forgive the Academy that one!This film is about a band of British POWs at a Japanese internment camp in the Burmese jungle during mid-WWII. They are led by career military man Colonel Nicholson (Best Actor Oscar winner Sir Alec Guiness) and the camp's Commander Saito forces Nicholson and his men to build a railroad bridge which trains will be able to cross to transport enemy troops and dignitaries, and to get supplies to enemy forces. Nicholson, ever the 'loyal' British officer, agrees to build a quality bridge in exchange for Saito treating his men in accordance with the Geneva Convention. Some of his officers question Nicholson's collusion with Saito and wonder about his patriotism. Also questioning Nicholson's motives are an American POW Shears (William Holden, who actually has top billing in this film and gives a terrific performance in his own right). Shears escapes the camp, only to be drafted by Major Warden (2nd billed Jack Hawkins) to be part of a team of Allied soldiers to return to the camp to destroy the bridge. Shears is necessary to lead the expedition since he was at the camp and could lead them the quickest route to get there.The film speaks a lot about the duality of man: on the one hand as 'prisoners' of war, Nicholson wanted he and his men to be treated accordingly to the Geneva convention, but he knew that to get this treatment, he had to make compromises with Saito; on the other hand, they were prisoners of 'war' and Saito is the enemy and it is unspoken rule that you should never collude with the enemy, even if it means mistreatment and taking uncalled for punishment. Nicholson is very prideful, prim, and proper and let these properties shine through. In his mind, he was doing his duty as a 'British' soldier, but in the end realized that what he was really doing was betraying the core values of what it really meant to be a British 'soldier'.The film is also very watchable, even today. You get completely enthralled by the story and characters. It never seems dated. The climactic bridge-destroying scene at the end always blows me away (no pun intended). And the last line in the film is one I've never forgotten and sums up the point of the whole film. A true classic.",The Bridge on the River Kwai
421,The Bridge on the River Kwai,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1383383/,"After years of more intimate British films and just discovering the joys of location shooting with 1955's ""Summertime"", master director David Lean made his first actual widescreen epic with 1957's ""The Bridge on the River Kwai"", an acknowledged classic that deserves attention from a new generation of viewers and another visit from the rest of us who love perfectly executed films by an unparalleled craftsman. Recently, this movie has been overshadowed by his 1962 follow-up epic, the comparatively more elaborate ""Lawrence of Arabia"", but this richly textured WWII-set adventure is special enough on its own terms. While it has its share of action and suspense presented in exacting detail, the film is even more resonant as a psychological drama about the test of wills between mission-driven officers amid the perils of wartime survival.The plot takes place in 1943 when after surrendering in Singapore, Col. Nicholson marches his ragged British company into a Japanese prisoner work camp in the Burmese jungle (this is where the famous whistling of ""Colonel Bogey March"" is first heard). The erudite Col. Saito runs the camp and demands that the new prisoners build a massive railway bridge, a critical juncture between Rangoon and Malaysia. In a classic stand-off, Nicholson finally forces Saito to respect Geneva Convention and not allow his officers to do manual labor on the construction. Upon his ironic Pyrrhic victory, Nicholson slowly descends into the madness of seeing the completed bridge as a potential morale booster for his battle-weary men. Meanwhile, shortly after Nicholson's arrival, U.S. Navy Cmdr. Shears escapes from the camp only to be later blackmailed into joining a British commando mission led by do-or-die Maj. Warden and hesitant Lt. Joyce with the sole goal of blowing up the bridge. Through Peter Taylor's thoughtful film editing, the movie breathlessly alternates between the parallel story lines of the bridge construction and the jungle commando mission until the exciting climax.Lean's accomplishments are many with this memorable film - the authenticity of the Burmese jungle locations (filmed in Sri Lanka), the seamless integration of the two story lines, the masterful handing of the final scenes, and in particular, the gradual metamorphosis of Nicholson from a by-the-book British officer to Saito's willing collaborator. A frequent participant in Lean's films, Alec Guinness gives his career-best performance as Nicholson providing all sorts of unexpected shades to his complex characterization. As Shears, William Holden does what he did best in the 1950's, concurrently exude natural bravado and a conflicted soul and then added a layer of cynicism that dares to challenge the viewer to support him. The 68-year old Sessue Hayakawa came out of retirement to play Saito and delivers a subtle performance of unbending discipline and pained humiliation. Jack Hawkins and Geoffrey Horne lend sturdy support as Warden and Joyce respectively. With the same expert eye he lent to ""Summertime"", Jack Hildyard provides the superbly expressive and composed cinematography. Michael Wilson and Carl Foreman, both blacklisted at the time, wrote the brilliantly developed screenplay. This is essential viewing.The two-disc 2000 Limited Edition DVD set has a pristine print transfer with great sound making the entire experience feel surprisingly fresh upon viewing. There is a nearly hour-long documentary on Disc Two, ""The Making of The Bridge on the River Kwai"", produced for the DVD and full of intriguing insight into the production logistics. There are a couple of shorter featurettes produced around the time of the film's original release, the first is a black-and-white teaser for the film itself and the second a rather pedestrian lesson in Film 101 produced by USC grad students and introduced by Holden. Director John Milius provides a respectful tribute to the film in another short.",The Bridge on the River Kwai
422,On the Waterfront,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0052536/,"Elia Kazan's film is still amazing after 50 years. It's curious how it parallels Kazan's own life in the way the main character, Terry Malloy, ends up naming names to the commission investigating the corruption on the waterfront, the same way the director did in front of the HUAC committee, presided by the evil Senator Joe McCarthy and his henchman, Roy Cohn.
Bud Schulberg's screen play is his best work for the movies. It also helped that Elia Kazan had a free reign over the film, which otherwise could have gone wrong under someone else's direction.Terry Malloy, as we see him first, is a man without a conscience. He is instrumental in ratting on a fellow longshoreman, who is killed because he knows about the criminal activities on the piers. At the same time, Terry is transformed and ultimately redeems himself because he falls in love with Edie Doyle, the sister of the man that is killed by the mob.
Terry Malloy is a complex character. His own brother Charley, is the right hand man of Johnny Friendly, the union boss. Charley is trying to save Terry. It's clear that Charley is going to be sacrificed because of the way he is acting by the same people he works with. In a way, the death of young Doyle is paid back with Charley's own, an interesting twist of events, when it should have been Terry the one that had ratted in the first place.Marlon Brando had his best opportunity here. Everyone lavished praise for his performance. I don't know whether it was me, or what, but the way he played Terry, at times, is an enigma. Could it be the way he speaks? The taxi scene, when he speaks in his famous line, his voice sounds so out of character. Maybe it was Brando's take on the character, but in retrospect, he doesn't sound like a New York wise guy. Eva Marie Saint, whose made her debut in the cinema in this movie, is excellent as the sweet Edie. It's incredible she stays with Terry even though he's been instrumental in the death of her own brother. She is obviously in love with Terry and will do anything for him. Karl Malden's character is also symbolic. He represents the sanity and the salvation for an otherwise horrible person, because Terry up to this point has no conscience and he is resentful for the fact he never got to be somebody when he had a chance in the boxing ring.Lee J. Cobb, one of the great actors of the American movies gives a detailed performance as Johnny Friendly, the boss of the union local that controlled the waterfront. Rod Steiger, as the crooked brother Charley was amazing. There are a lot of minor roles such as Martin Balsam, who went to bigger and better things. Also, a non speaking Fred Gwynne who is part of Friendly's crew.This films owes a great deal to the black and white cinematography of Boris Kaufman and to the great musical score of Leonard Bernstein. Was it me, or was this film an inspiration for the music he later composed for West Side Story?One of the greatest films of all times.",On the Waterfront
423,The Wages of Fear,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0050219/,"This is richer, tenser, more atmospheric, and in all ways a better film than Clouzot's next one, ""Les Diabolique"" - which is saying a lot.  I've never understood why Clouzot isn't more highly regarded.  Indeed, for a long time I simply couldn't believe that he wasn't.One charge that hangs over his head is misogyny.  With regards to ""Les Diabolique"" this is simply ridiculous; with regards to ""The Wages of Fear"", I can see how one could harbour the uncomfortable feeling that there is, perhaps, something in it.  But what, really, does the evidence amount to? The fact that one of the heroes is inexcusably cruel to his girlfriend? It's not as if the film endorses this, or invites us to take pleasure in it, or even, for that matter, allows us to.  The characters are all flawed, and the film doesn't seek to deny it.  It does, however, make an attempt to explain it.  That town in the middle of nowhere is, we feel, really in the MIDDLE of nowhere; it must be the dustiest and most demoralising place on Earth.  After a while we feel as if we could start kicking someone, just to break the monotony.There's no doubt that the initial monotony gives the rest of the film half its strength.  William Wyler once said that if you want to surprise or shock an audience the best thing you can do is bore them half to death beforehand - and although I can think of absolutely no reason why this should be so, allowing for a little exaggeration, it's true.  The seemingly aimless opening sequences help make every single frame, from the moment the nitro-glycerin is mentioned, electric.So much is, in retrospect, amazing.  There's the way Clouzot manages to show us the humanity in these seemingly squalid people.  (Even the oil magnate, just when we think he's the world's most heartless capitalist, reveals he has a heart with an unexpected remark, and yet the remark doesn't feel at all out of character - it's the kind of masterful characterisation film-goers live for.)  Then there's the obstacles these drivers must face. All are memorable; most are so perfectly realised they deserve to be called mythic.",The Wages of Fear
424,The Wages of Fear,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1190062/,"This movie is astonishing, a gritty story filmed in an ultra-real style that relies simply on the beauty of lighting and film to achieve its stunning effects. It seems from another world, which in a way, it is. The acting is superb: Montand's Mario is full of jerky movements and intense impulses but always maintains his Gallic savoir-faire, while Charles Vanel as Jo brings, at first at least, a type of macho to the screen that modern movie-makers simply do not comprehend. The rest of the cast, especially the camp chief, Luigi, and Peter van Eyck as Bimba are incredible, as is Vera Clouzot who is incomprehensibly but believably upbeat and innocent - and totally gorgeous - in the midst of the hellhole of a town they're all stuck in. Clouzot's directing is flawless - I don't think anyone has ever squeezed more tension with just a few essential scene elements. The trucks wheeze and grunt as well as they ever have in the movies - the only comparison is Spielberg's early gem, ""The Duel"", but Clouzot's automotive cinematics outdo even Spielberg. The stripped down existentialism of the characters, the starkness of their shared dilemma, the grim and grimy scenery, and the cinematography itself are all of a piece. The latter is what elevates this movie to the very top rank, including some of the most dramatic and effective black and white shooting I've ever seen. Yet it never becomes mannered or gratuitous - it is orchestrated with the rise - and rise! - of tension in the film. The final scene takes on a surreal as opposed to ultra-realistic quality that has its own logic. One last word about the acting - we don't see anything like it anymore. The self-conscious mannerism of method acting (which has had its own triumphs) and the toxic awareness of everyone from the actors to the audience, the camera, directors, etc. that each actor is a celebrity and potential artiste, has ruined that conviction that actors were once larger than life people before they went on-screen, that they came to acting as an outcome of living rough, unadorned, and yet imaginative lives as opposed to shooting for fame and fortune and celebrity within an artificial corporate star-making incubator.",N/A
425,Ace in the Hole,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1006122/,"""Ace In the Hole,"" which used to turn up on local TV as ""The Big carnival,"" was far head of its time. It wasn't very successful and its cynicism shocked people.Along comes Andy Warhol almost two decades later with his notion of ""fifteen minutes of fame"" and everyone buys that concept. It's not quite the same as the concept of this. Nor is that of the very popular ""Network,"" which came even later. But the premise here is that reporter Kirk Douglas will literally jeopardize a man's life in order to get a series of big newspaper stories. And does anyone today doubt that such things happen? Wilder was often cynical, though here it is to the most meaningful end. ""the Fortune Cookie"" and ""Kiss Me, Stupid"" are cynical also and they are both fun but this one makes a very trenchant point and they do not.The acting is superb. Kirk Douglas gave many brilliant performances. This is one of them. The trailer included in the DVD I just saw crows that with this Jan Sterling will be immediately elevated to the top rank of female stars. That never happened but she is excellent here, as generally elsewhere.The interviews of Wilder by Cameron Crowe tell a funny story about the genesis of one of her lines. I'd better not quote it; so get that book. It's very entertaining, informative, and touching.Wilder was one of =this country's great directors.

426,Ace in the Hole,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1644274/,"The movie very closely parallels the real events of January 30 to February 16, 1925 in terms of the general story line. There are some significant differences concerning the actions of the characters.Floyd Collins, a cave explorer working alone (not a real good idea), was trapped in Sand Cave KY, near Mammoth Cave. He was not looking for treasure, but for a new cave suitable for commercializing to produce income in an economically depressed region...and this was before the Depression occurred.He became trapped on the way out of the cave by a 27 lb. rock which rolled onto his leg in a narrow crawlway. The configuration was such that it could not be moved enough to get his foot past.When he failed to return home, the family went searching and quickly found him only 150' inside the cave.A huge rescue effort was mounted and a cub reporter, Skeets Miller, from Louisville KY showed up to cover the story. It became one of the three most widely broadcast events of the time. Besides the extensive newspaper coverage, the relatively new medium of commercial radio riveted listeners with hourly accounts. It quickly became the first media circus ever seen.Because of the print and radio coverage people began flocking to the site. A carnival atmosphere did indeed spring up around the cave. The state police and National Guard were called out by the governor to control the chaos and the more than 20,000 onlookers. The similarity between the real event and the movie on this account are likely nearly identical.As in the movie, a decision was made to drill a shaft and, also as in the movie, the rock was fairly unstable and prone to collapse from the pounding of the cable tool drilling rig. The longer the effort went on, the more unstable the cave passage became.Unlike Kirk Douglas' character in the movie, Skeets Miller served a most honorable role. Due to his small build he became one of very few persons able, and eventually the only one willing, to enter in an attempt to deliver food and water to Collins. He received a Pulitzer Prize for his reporting. Also unlike the movie, there was no manipulation of the event to delay the rescue, but there was considerable disagreement over how to best do it. Area coal miners made the initial attempts and the event concluded with the above-mentioned shaft.Collins was presumed to have died 3 days before rescuers reached him. Because the conditions were so unstable, the body was left in the cave. The family was able to remove him about 80 days afterward for a proper burial. Later, his glass-topped casket was returned to the now-commercial cave as a tourist attraction. It was removed once again, and finally, in 1989.In 1982, a definitive account of the event was published in the book 'Trapped!'. A most informative read.In a take-off of the 'Free Tibet' bumper stickers, vehicles are occasionally seen with a 'Free Floyd Collins' sticker.",N/A

433,Mr. Smith Goes to Washington,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1001936/,"The theme of one man being able to combat the ways of a long-established system is not a new one. In fact, man versus machine is one of the oldest forms of conflict in cinema, but this is a different kind of ""machine,"" this ""Taylor Machine."" When a young, naive, and idealistic man by the name of Jefferson Smith (James Stewart) is placed, as a pawn, in the United States Senate, he is honored and humbled by the job set out before him. He sees it as an opportunity to provide a service for his country, and, even more so, his people. In Jefferson Smith, we see everything that is good and wholesome in America. One man who wishes for nothing more than an improvement upon a country that he already cherishes. He intends to do everything he can to fulfill his duty as a newly appointed Senator. However, the people that put him there were not nearly as patriotic in their intentions. Jim Taylor (Edward Arnold) and Senator Joseph Harrison Paine (Claude Rains) have conspired to put Smith in office in hopes that he will simply sit there and keep quiet while they pass a bill that will profit Taylor. Smith's dream of building a national boy's camp is shattered by Taylor's scheme to build a dam in the same area. The powerful Jim Taylor is forced to pull some strings in order to discredit the young senator so that his dam can be built. The Taylor Machine frames Smith, accusing him of fraud. Shamed, Smith is ready to leave Washington behind when his assistant, Clarissa Saunders (Jean Arthur) inspires him to fight for his ideals just as his forefathers had. Smith returns to congress, armed with a new strategy to accomplish his goal.James Stewart gives one of his finest performances as Jefferson Smith, the young, passionately patriotic Senator confronting corruption in the government he holds so dear. Jean Arthur's performance as Clarissa Saunders is strong, while Claude Rains is forced to counter Stewart's inspired intensity (a feat that I feel he accomplishes). The filibuster scene is one of the highlights of the film, and one of the more memorable sequences in American cinema. Mr. Smith Goes to Washington is a wonderful movie, not just because of James Stewart's relentless performance, but because it has quite a bit to say. It is a statement declaring that ideals are stronger than the pages they are printed on, and that it is our ideals and the spirit through which we see them realized that allows one man to topple ""the machine.""",Mr. Smith Goes to Washington
434,Mr. Smith Goes to Washington,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0020075/,"James Stewart and Frank Capra.  One needn't know much more going in to be assured that this will be an enjoyable film.  Together they take on the Washington elite with this dramatic comedy about a naïve Washington outsider who gets appointed to the Senate and stands alone against corruption and graft.  Jefferson Smith (James Stewart) is appointed from an unnamed state after one of its Senators dies.  He is appointed because the political fat cats need someone who will not seem like a crony, but who will not stand in the way of a graft scheme for a pork barrel dam that will make bigwig Jim Taylor (Edward Arnold) millions.  When the wide eyed Smith gets to Washington, he discovers the corrupt bill because the dam will stand in the way of his own proposed bill for a children's camp.  When he tries to stop the project, Taylor's political machine frames him to make it seem like he is the one taking graft.  This leads to the dramatic confrontation in the Senate, where Smith filibusters in an attempt to get the truth out.This film is wonderful in so many ways.  The story is a classic struggle between good and evil.  In typical Capra style, the protagonist and antagonists are exaggerated so there is no confusion as to who are the good guys and who are the bad guys.  If there is one clear message in Capra's films it is that those with strong moral fiber never give up hope.  He likes to create utterly hopeless situations for characters to test their integrity, and rewards unswerving adherence to basic values and principles by triumph against the odds.  I was dismayed to see a comment, obviously from a young viewer of this film, that said that the characters weren't realistic because no one used profanity.  This is a sad testimonial to our culture, when it inconceivable to young people that there was once a time when profanity was the exception and not the rule. Stewart is brilliant as the idealistic and awe struck kid from the backwoods who is overwhelmed by the glory of Washington, with its monuments and history.  The story brings us a confrontation between political expediency and idealistic principles with the message that the truly great men are the ones that don't compromise their principles to hold on to power.  Stewart also brings a whole treasure chest of bumbling comedic sight gags that make him all the more lovable in the part.Jean Arthur is fabulous as the tough and savvy assistant who is jaded by Washington politics, but gets a fresh injection of fervor as she listens to Smith's noble homespun philosophies.  Claude Rains is also masterful as the adulterated Senator, who sold his soul to corruption for a chance at the presidency.  He plays the simultaneous sense of guilt and ambition with a torment that is clearly ripping his heart out, and the power of both emotions portrayed in his performance makes his character both repugnant and pitiable.This film is a national treasure.  It is in my top 50 list of all time.  The story of corruption in politics and the greatness of the men who resist it is timeless and would not be lost on the politicians in Washington today.

It's easy to be sentimental about war, even while deploring it, by focusing on the horror of it or by making heroes out of those who are forced to fight. Renoir deals instead with the far more complex mesh of differences and alliances that separate and divide our characters. And while his main characters all have a clear class/national/religious identity, he makes much more out of them than just sociological categories.But trying to explain why Grand Illusion is such a great movie by charting all the conflicting bonds of nationality, class, religion, etc. doesn't explain why the movie is so powerful. To me it is in those scenes in which language either separates our characters (as when Marechal tries and fails to tell the British prisoners about the tunnel or asks why de Boeldieu uses ""vous"") or unites them (as when von Rauffenstein and de Boeldieu speak in English or the English officer (in drag) sings the Marseillaise or when Marechal finally learns a little German). In these cases, Renoir uses language-without hitting us over the head to make the point-to illustrate the conflict between his ideal of sympathy between humans and the differences of class, nationality and religion.Now I know that this sounds just as dry and academic as other attempts to explain Grand Illusion. Maybe it is; the movie really does not need to be explained to be enjoyed. But these are the scenes that, for whatever reason, have always made the greatest impression on me.",Grand Illusion
438,It Happened One Night,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1089005/,"Peter, a washed up journalist, accidentally bumps into Ellen Andrews, a spoiled daughter of a rich guy from whom she ran away, on a bus while taking a trip to New York. He offers to help her hide from her dad if she agrees to sell her story only to him. But on their way to New York they fall in love...There are many old classic film that are excellent but leave you with a ""Yeah, great...but I expected something else"" feeling. But ""It happened one night"" is one of those films that leaves you amazed without any reservations. I was neither a Clark Gable, Claudette Colbert or a Frank Capra fan before I saw this road movie, which won 5 Oscars, but after I did I became of fan of them for life! The story here is so damn simple that you may at first think that everyone could be able to pull it of, but when you think about it you will realize that at the same time it's actually very clever, carefully written and touching.------------- Take this scene for instance. Ellen is looking in front of herself while a burglar steals her luggage behind her back. She doesn't notice anything but Peter sees this and runs after the burglar. Ellen, still not turning around, is wondering where he is running of to. After a while Peter, all tired, returns and says: ""He got away...!"" And Ellen not knowing what's going on replies: ""I don't know what you are talking about!"" That's a perfect example how someone is trying to be a gentleman and ends up as a fool. But this is actually a film more touching than funny. After a while the spoiled Ellen shows her gentle side and realizes that she loves Peter. She says this to her father in tears because she thinks that Peter doesn't love her. So incredibly magical and yet so simple. It's incredibly high grade of 9/10 on the site rotten-tomatoes.com is justified. Too bad almost all TV stations are keeping this jewel of air for decades! No wonder my generation is trapped in a vicious circle of violence, drugs and alcohol. They never got a glimpse of such previous generations with a soul and such raw, honest and touching beauty like ""It happened one night"" which exceeds the human mind.Grade: 10/10",It Happened One Night
439,The Passion of Joan of Arc,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4120699/,"It's Falconetti's face,somehow Dreyer managed to capture on film what seems impossible,such raw human emotion,a soul if you will,and the viewer is left drained at what they had just seen. I recommend the 24 frames a second with the 'Voices of Light' score,and watch it on the biggest screen you can find,because this is a life changing experience,transcendent even.Falconetti gives the greatest performance I've ever seen on film,and the director uses closeups for much of the movie,it's confrontational and brilliant,there is nowhere to look but at Joan,what she is going through,it's powerful stuff,your life will be elevated by just watching it.",The Passion of Joan of Arc
440,The Circus,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1333880/,"I enjoyed this a lot more the second time when I could see it on a very clear DVD print. I don't know why that would make a difference with the story, but it did as I found it very good for the entire distance, although that's just a scant 69 minutes.In the story, Charlie Chaplin does his normally-great physical slapstick so well that he accidentally becomes a hit at the circus, which is run by a nasty man (Allan Garcia) who regularly beats his sweet step-daughter, played by a very pretty Merna Kennedy. Charlie, of course, gets smitten by her and comes to her rescue.This movie has a different kind of ending that what you'd normally see for a comedy but it's inspiring as Chaplin performs a noble deed. (However, Kennedy's character is in question as she seems satisfied to marry either of two men. Huh?)Chaplin's timing and clever slapstick routines never fail to amaze me. Even though silent films aren't seen by many people these days, it's works of art like this that will endure forever. This is not of one of Chaplin's more famous movies.....but it should be. I think it's one of his best.",The Circus
441,Sunrise,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3468348/,"After watching The circus in cinema class I chose to watch Sunrise: A song of Two humans because it had such great reviews and was said to be the greatest silent movie of that time and still is today, so I had to watch it. And I am very glad I did. I really enjoyed watching this movie, I thought it was very beautifully and it was a great story and told very brilliantly with it being a silent a film. It was very dramatic and sometimes kind of eerie. At times like when the husband is walking through the woods at night to meet his lover, and its all foggy, it kind of reminded me of a scene from the horror movie the Wolfman. I love that with silent movies the music always goes with the story to make the scene more eerie, or more happy and cheerful. I was kind of impressed with the cinematography of this film, There was a lot of different editing techniques used that I did not expect from a movie of this time. There are several times throughout the film where we see two different scene in one, we kind of see some flashbacks of thinking about killing his wife and he remembers his lover and kissing her and the scene kind of fades out to that then back to him. And we also see some flash forwards of him thinking about drowning his wife. I thought it was kind of funny the way they made it look like they are just all happy in love again and it seems like they are walking in a beautiful meadow but really they are just still walking in the street and cause a traffic jam. We do even hear a little bit of sound in this silent film besides just the music we hear some church bells. This movie had everything drama, a little bit of horror, a little bit of humor, a love story. This was a really great a film and I can see why its rated as one of the best silent films.",Sunrise: A Song of Two Humans
442,The General,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5120254/,"Directed by Buster Keaton. Starring Buster Keaton, Marion Mack, Glen Cavender, Frank Barnes, Charles Henry Smith, Jim Farley, Frederick Vroom.Silent comedy masterpiece with Keaton as a Southern engineer who has two loves in his life: his train, The General, and his best gal, Annabelle (Mack); when Union spies kidnap her, steal his choo-choo, and seek to raze the Confederate Army supply lines, he jumps to action. Essentially, one big chase movie on trains, with Keaton at first as the pursuer and later as the pursued; enormously clever and inventive, not to mention frequently hilarious (Keaton's reaction shots, never overplayed, are especially a riot). The film is also surprisingly exciting, with large-scale set pieces involving army regiment maneuvers/battles, collapsing bridges, and sensational crashes, not to mention seamless slapstick stuntwork from the Great Stone Face himself. A financial and critical flop upon its release, it is now widely viewed as one of the greatest American films ever made, and rightly so. Based on a real historical event in 1862 known as the ""Great Locomotive Chase.""97/100",The General
443,The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2480278/,"The influence of this film simply cannot be over-stated. It is not only a picture that exemplifies German Expressionist cinema but it also arguably invented the horror film too. Sure, there were movies with horror elements before Caligari, but this is surely the one that formulated it into a full-length feature. Not only that but this is also where the art film began too. Films would simply never be the same again after The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari.Of course the first thing that is immediately obvious is the bizarre visual aesthetic and bold set design. Everything is at uncomfortable angles. Trees and grass look like blades. Doors and windows are never symmetrical. Buildings are shaped in impossible angular styles. Everything is awash with extreme lighting, while the sets are painted with abstract and expressionistic designs. The crazed look of the film is of course meant to represent the insanity of the central character's mind. This must surely be the first time that cinema had tried to visually represent the subjective inner workings of a psychologically damaged mind. It also was pioneering in that the framing story where we meet the troubled protagonist also allowed for a flashback narrative and twist ending – both revolutionary ideas at the time.Needless to say that the film features extreme melodramatic acting that was prevalent at the time in the silent era. However, despite all this, Conrad Veidt is terrific as Casare the somnambulist. This is a character that remains very compelling to this day. His combination of darkness with a ballet dancer's graceful movements is one that will never get old. Cesare remains iconic and always will be. Which is something which can be said for The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari in general. This ancient film remains mysterious, evocative and bold. It's one of the most important films ever made and its dream-like ambiance is something that should be seen by anyone at all interested in the formation of cinema as an art form.",The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari
444,Togo,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5339159/,"This is the first time that I think Walt Disney Picture did a great job on this amazing movie. A movie that deserves to be called ""Mission Impossible!"" Willem Dafoe and Julianne Nicholson both are great. The screenplay writer Tom Flynn gave us a straightforward plot, simple but amazing scenario that has made this movie so suspenseful, thrilling, at the same time, profound. Director Ericson Core also won my praise wholeheartedly. The special effects team did a wonder too, many scenes I just couldn't believe possible to make, but they just looked so real and so powerful. The crossing lake scenes are just ridiculously fascinating. The leading dog's performance is just beyond any word could describe, and the poppy that played Togo's younger age would allow you to understand what ""cute"" really means. Willem Dafoe, what a great actor! Julianne Nicholson, her natural talent completely shinning through the whole movie. Every part of this movie is a fulfilled perfection, it also owes to the great casting job, through the lens of the camera, offering you great cinematography, followed by a perfect editing job....The almost impossible mission, the dogs, the great couple and the great town people...all together, have made this movie THE VERY BEST MOVIE at the year end of 2019.Highly recommended!",Togo

446,Airlift,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3462879/,"One thing I've found prevalent among Indian cinemas are the ratings.Some of them are absurd to a point where you doubt the authenticity of IMDb as a source for checking the quality of any movie.This movie is one of the good ones but still it does not deserve its rating at all.There is no way it comes close to it.For example consider the latest release like Deadpool or Batman vs Superman.Both are equally excellent in terms of story,cinematography and both possess a line of star studded casts.Yet both of them do not have a rating they deserve because of the fair and right ratings from experts and viewers not from a particular or single place but from all over the world.Looking at this rating,I seriously doubt the entire Indian cinema ratings and would rather skip than waste my time and energy to go through any of the high rated movies and would skip the ones that do not even reach 5.This is my personal opinion but all I'm saying is the fans are not doing anyone any favors by giving outrageous ratings.",N/A

Akshay Kumar gives his heart and soul to the role and is a huge reason why the movie achieves its heights. The screenplay and direction are top notch, and the music is very hum worthy.

449,Bajrangi Bhaijaan,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3279134/,"Despite being a Salman fan I was not too impressed with some of his recent flicks which in my humble opinion lacked freshness or had mindless direction, so when a family member bought tickets for this movie I didn't go in with high expectations. But to you dear reader I'll say GO WITH HIGH EXPECTATIONS! It will not disappoint! And more importantly go with your heart - that is all you need for this 2.5 hours long film to become one of the best you've seen in years. It's just one of those movies with such heart-tugging moments and the highlight - the bond between Pawan (Salman) and Shahida (Harshali) - which is such a delight to see that you forget all about plot, logic, direction - not to say that the movie lacks that. The perfection in execution is definitely there, especially in the second-half. I watched it in the AVX theatre with at least 500 others and from the sound of it at least 75% of them regardless of age or gender were crying from the intermission onwards - sometimes because it was sad and other times because the screenplay was just so pure and unfiltered that it just made these happy tears bubble up inside of you.There is a certain level of comedy throughout and definitely some deep witty one-liners. My favourite was from Nawazuddin Sidduiqi (who played his role to perfection) who pointing at the current state of the media and their polarization of India and Pakistan proclaimed that ""Hatred sells. Mohabbat doesn't."" The movie has depth, a message, and the cuteness overload that is Harshali Malhotra. It also has a relationship and emotions so simple yet so extraordinary that they make a hero out of a common man. :)",Bajrangi Bhaijaan

Akshay Kumar do not need to romance hot girls, do not need to dance and sing, do not need to do melodrama to deliver a hit movie, he had shown us this back in Special 26, he has done the same here in Baby. The cast is a perfect one and there are no flaws.MOVIE: It has everything a good espionage thriller need to have- 1. Good cop bad cop routine 2. Cute chick beating the pulp out of the bad guy 3. Super cool combat scenes 4. No unnecessary sentiments and drama 5. Some brilliant dialogues 6. few laugh out loud scenes 7. It focuses on modern warfare--an indirect one--proxy war, which is much spoken about in reference to India in recent times 8. Kick ass background score 9. Cool Spy v/s bad guys 10. funny Akshay Anupam Kher duoOn negatives: Yes even i think the movie was a bit lengthy, if the director had trimmed it 10-15 minutes it would had been great. Yet, this movie is a rare feat. Bollywood rarely delivers movies like this. Its a must watch if you like sensible movies.

451,Baby,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3168639/,"Though I don't categorize movies on the basis of their region or country, I had mentioned this title regarding India being proud of this movie. This is because I have heard people yelling in social media and in public about the low standards of Indian movies specially thrillers which either lack thrill or are copied from Hollywood. I agree to them o most occasions but this one. And I would strongly recommend people who complain about the lack of good movies in Bollywood to go and watch it. Or else stop complaining these craps.Coming on to the movie, it describes the biggest agenda world is facing right now, i.e, Terrorism, in best way it could. The story comprises of many small incidents which are bound together so slickly that we feel the smooth flow of script. We are lost in the hustle going on in front of us and are keen to know what is coming next. First half makes the plot for the movie and the second half unleashes the execution. Each and every scenes complements its predecessor and we are biting our nails without even noticing it. Last hour is full of thrilling actions and grueling proceedings.Talking about the acting , I must say Akshay Kumar has delivered a role of his life very convincingly. He lives his character and puts that extra amount of thrill via his superb action. Danny plays his role quite brilliantly. Anupam, Tapsee, Kay Kay and other supporting casts act life to their characters and make this movie a combo of power packed performances.Director Neeraj Pandey has already made a Wednesday and Sp 26 in past and thats why there was a very little scope for improvement for him. But I would be lying if i don't say that this is a notch higher that his earlier masterpieces. Editing is quite crisp. Screenplay is the soul of this movie while BM is equally engaging. Cinematography is grand and deserve applause. Dialogues are apt and support the movie a lot. Music is average and rightly so. Choreography is nil while action is breathtaking.It has a few flaws here and there in a few scenes but those are hardly noticed due to the fast paced drama and screenplay.Overall, a standing ovation for Neeraj and Akshay to give us Indians a movie to feel proud of. It can easily go into books as one of the best Hindi movies.A movie of Hollywood standard and execution. And who knows Akshay might get a shot at his dream of wining a National Award. I won't be surprised if he gets one along with Neeraj Pandey. It also has a potential to be India's official Oscar entry next year.I have rated this movie comparing it to other Indian movies...otherwise I would universally give it a 9 or 9.5.",N/A
452,La La Land,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3611745/,"What is everyone in this film singing and dancing about? Our story starts off in a traffic jam on a freeway and suddenly everyone does a song and dance number that sets the tone that this film is a colorful original musical about ambitious young people who pursue their dreams in LA. The opening musical number is painful to watch but I assume the story will improve.Our central characters are an actress who aspires to be a famous movie star and a musician who aspires to be a moody jazz pianist. She falls in love with him when she first hears him play his music. He falls in love with her as they begin to date and explore Hollywood. They soon trip head over heals in love and as if by magic they dance with bliss along the milky way. The only problem is - she soon reveals that she does not understand what is so great about jazz. (Wait - I thought she loved his music when she first heard him play?) So he explains the history of jazz and the poetry of the musician. That seems good enough and they continue their starry eyed romance. But her auditions are a bust. No work. Nothing changes. She has to write a one woman play to perform to demonstrate her craft. Yet he lands an opportunity to perform in a big band - the only problem is the music will be more upbeat pop funk jazz hybrid that will make him pretty good money but also take him away from his dreams to be the moody jazz pianist. He sells out to get work - and she stays true to herself and finds no work. This creates a schism and they have a very corny argument about creative direction. He does not understand what is wrong with him making money and traveling and being famous even if he truly knows that it sells out his dreams. She does not understand why she cannot get work even though she stays true to her dreams - and when her one woman show is a dud she decides to quit her dreams and move back home. Our dashing hero feels awful and soon learns that she has one final audition that awaits and so he drives to her home in Nevada to tell her that she must return for one final audition. They travel back to LA - she sings at her audition - and she gets the role. Both have their own careers now - so they split up. Five years later - she is a famous movie star married with children and he has his own jazz club where he lives his dreams as a moody jazz pianist. One night by happenstance - she stumbles into the club and finds him. He plays a solo piano song and she has a dream where their entire love affair is relived only all the choices which led to their separation are made differently and they stay together and have a family and discover their dreams as a couple. Suddenly, she understands what his words meant so long ago - about the history of jazz - the poetry of the musician - now everything comes full circle - and they have a longing final glance. This is all cool - don't get me wrong. But the story itself has been told so many times its clichés are even clichéd. The songs and dialogue are very uneven and at times the film is incoherently stupid. Really - do young couples talk about why they would sell out their dreams to make thousands of dollars a month? Also, the big red flag with the story is that the music simply is not very good. There is not one memorable song or dance in the entire film! Mostly the lights and costumes replace any real choreography or musical number with a unique visual cue. Also, Ryan Gosling is poorly cast as a jazz pianist. It just does not feel real at all that Gosling is so, so sad in LA with his poor dreams of being a jazz pianist so hard to recognize as he dates lovely women.What exactly is the purpose of this film? What was everyone singing and dancing about? Do we live in a world where people can fly down to LA and pursue their dreams with a shot like yesteryear? Or do we live in a world where educational alliances, corporate oligarchy, family connections, and the occasional marriage - determine who gets to shine in the lights? Are we as a people supposed to rejoice that the song and dance of old Hollywood musicals had a tribute film made just in time for the Oscar season? I dunno - this movie does have some strong moments in the script - and it does have some good acting - costumes - and lights - but I just think it's corny and I could not care less.",La La Land

454,The Martian,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3331022/,"The Martian is a new Ridley Scott classic, featuring his best work in years, the best performance I've ever seen from Matt Damon, an outstanding supporting cast, a surprisingly funny screenplay from Daredevil creator Drew Goddard, and a great narrative that ties the film together beautifully. As expected with Ridley Scott films, the film itself is visually stunning. The landscape of Mars looks absolutely breathtaking, and the scenes aboard the Hermes and back on Earth are just as sharp in detail and scope. The way he chose to make this film made it almost seem like an exceptionally made biopic. Many times during this film, I legitimately believed that Mark Watney was a real, living person that was actually stranded on Mars for many months alone. It's Cast Away meets Apollo 13, and this marriage is crafted beautifully. Matt Damon is absolutely brilliant in this film. He plays Watney with so much optimism that it actually makes the depressing aspect of the film not as depressing for me. However, when he has to put on his dramatic chops in certain scenes, he truly commits to the drama of the situation, and that right there is true Ridley Scott suspense for you. The supporting cast, everyone involved, all do great work as well. Jeff Daniels, Jessica Chastain, particularly Chiwetel Ejiofor. He is one of the best actors working today, and this movie and 12 Years a Slave shows how far he's come. The most surprisingly element about this movie though was the screenplay. The film is hilarious in some parts, in fact I'd argue that it's funnier than most comedies that have come out this year. What makes to movie unique to me was Watney's optimistic point of view. He believes that he isn't going to die on Mars, and this transforms this rather depressing situation into something comical instead. But when you really think about it, this is a very personal film about some people coming together to save somebody. That's it. And in today's world, it's nice to hear an story about people coming together to save one of their own. I have nothing bad to say about The Martian. It's the best film I've seen all year.",The Martian
455,Zootopia,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4822803/,"""A little bit of kindness goes a long way"" would be a perfect quote for this film.When Judy Hopps, a country rabbit, shoots for her dreams as a part of the police force in Zootopia(Zootropolis), things weren't what she expected it to be. She was forced to face reality for what it truly was. Sound familiar?It may have delivered a couple of messages that people have already heard dozens of times, but that doesn't take away the strength it gives to those who believe that what matters the most is trying to do things right in their lives and in society. I wasn't expecting to find this to be a source of encouragement and inspiration, but that's what it delivered. The ""true"" conflict presented was also as relevant as it was when this film was released. A divide that caused unrest among the ones that should be working towards improving society.One small crutch from the plot was its use of circumstance to move the story along. But overall, this can be overlooked since after all, it isn't only with wits or pure strength alone that would allow a person to find solutions to the problems that they face in their lives.Using cartoons as a medium to convey the kind of messages it did was also a brilliant move on the part of the producer and creators of this film. It would be a good and effective learning material for parents or older people to use to teach young people as a way to prepare and make them understand how the world works.Brilliant movie.",Zootopia (also known as Zootropolis)

The pictures were perfect, like a moving water painting that portrayed spring time. But not only the scenery was stunning; the characters were drawn in detail, making them look realistic and closer to a real person. The story was nice as well. The description made it look like the story of Thumbelina or something, but it's not. I think it's based on a folklore Japanese tale, but I'm not sure. Still, it was very interesting, and had this rustic vibe, with the moon princess being sent to earth to live among the humans. The fantasy element is there, however, the story contains some real human emotions and situations, with manly the love for the countryside life and the family bond to overpower any other story of romance or magical kingdoms.

459,Wonder,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4081263/,"Firstly, I know there are some people with real facial disfigurements who are upset that the child wasn't played by someone with a real facial disfigurement, I can understand why. But as I have unilateral cleft palate myself which is similar, and that I have faced much discrimination throughout life, I feel that it was appropriate to cast a non disfigured child for the role. Why?As unlike a child actor without disfigurement, he wouldn't be able to clean the movie makeup off afterwards. Therefore other kids and even adults in the real world would assume that the young actor is still in character, and bullied even more for it. The movie would only enforce the focus even more on his real life disfigurement in the real world and less on the young actor who played him. Therefore I feel that it was a wise insightful appropriate move. If it was an adult character then I would question it...Anyway back to the movie.It was...okay. But it didn't nail the true reality. I identified with a few things especially the bullying. But as I suspected this movie would be which is a major problem of what a lot of these kind of movies have, it feels much too sanitised.The kid dealt with it a lot better than I did, a lot better than many do. But maybe it is partly because he has the unrealistic perfect movie parents and idyllic family life, and of course as I also suspected would happen he receives a standing ovation from the whole school at the end and everybody is now his friend. As Gargamel would say ""How sickeningly sweet!"".In the real world quite often the bullying is relentless right to the end where even teachers and head teachers don't do a damn thing, and even victim blame, and that it often continues into adult life with even more discrimination. I know this from hard experiences.Another thing, as somebody else pointed out and I agree, the main character ""Auggie"" started talking about how you can tell someone from their shoes. Trust fund kid, crazy kid, hand-me-down kid.....Why would he judge others on their appearance when he gets similar treatment himself? I realise the narrative is probably there to suggest that everybody can be unfairly stereotyped, but for me in the real world I think we with severe facial disfigurements have learned to be less superficial than that.I for one would like to watch a real hard hitting gritty realistic movie, from childhood through to adulthood where it doesn't have the perfect sanitised happy TV movie ending. Not necessarily a really sad unhappy ending, but at least an ending where it shows that he or she as an adult has learned life's harsh lessons the hard way through the continuing bigotry of others through life. Show the world what many of us still go through.The child actor should again be played by someone who isn't disfigured for real for the reasons I gave, but an adult actor who is more emotionally mature and equipped to deal with the cruel comments in the real world should be played by an actor who is.""Wonder"" is a sweet movie with good intentions, worth watching the once and it does show a degree of empathy which we need more of these days, but it is still typical TV movie syrupy and sanitised melodrama stuff, that isn't near realistic enough. I hope one day it might inspire a more insightful educating movie and portray the true harsh reality of living with facial disfigurements (and maybe even added speech impairment) even if it alarms and shocks people. It would send a more powerful message and that would be a good thing.5/10",Wonder
460,Wonder,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3862552/,"We Need this type of movies nowadays!It is an emotional, funny & uplifting story. I was fully sympathized with August Pullman. It was so wonderful to see and feel everything through him. The way he describes everything is so beautiful. Also, knowing the story from the perspective of certain characters made a strong connection between me and them.I read the book. It was awesome too. Some details were changed in the movie but were good changes and there are some details from the book I hoped the movie to show it and it didn't but that didn't affect the movie in a negative way. Everything was simple, clear and on point. The movie has strong messages about kindness, love, appreciating everyone for who they are and true friendship.Jacob Tremblay proves again his talent as an actor. You won't recognize him because of the makeup but his expressions, voice and eyes were really persuasive. All the kids are amazing. Izabela Vidovic surprised me a lot. Julia Roberts is excellent and Owen Wilson was great. He was exactly as I imagined him while reading the Book.Finally, Stephen Chbosky. Great job man! Once again he made me care about the characters and he portrayed them beautifully specially the kids. He let them shine in every scene.I loved this movie so much. I had a great and enjoyable time with it. I laughed and cried. It is pure and heartwarming. This is a perfect family movie.",Wonder

462,Special 26,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2750293/,Finally 2013 has its first Awesome movie. Its been an year with all crappy movies so far. Special 26 steals the show easily.The characters and actors have been so well chosen. Each actor has got the perfect character. The casting could not have been better than this. The direction is superb. So is the Art Direction. The story does not lag anywhere. So its a superb story with some really good editing.Talking about actors -Akshay Kumar - comes out of his day to day roles of khiladi and joker stuff. This is serious cinema which makes him a complete actor.Anupam Kher - reminds everyone that he is still very much the same awesome actor as the one in 90s.Jimmy Sheirgill - chooses the right kind of role finally. He perfectly fits the role of SI Ranvir Singh and also fits well in the 1987 plot.Manoj Bajpai - as good as ever. Special 26 ka CBI inspector Waseem Khan is as good as Wasseypur ka Sardar Khan.Kavya - hardly any role for her. Shes in the movie for songs only.Divya Dutta - standard supportive role. does well.Others - very well done.Art direction for Delhi steals the show. the 1987 Delhi has been brought alive. details have been worked out well. 1987 Mumbai disappointed. I guess it was very tough to recreate that so the director and the VFX team chose the green screen. Thats the shoddiest part of the movie and hence i gave the 9/10 and not a full tenner.Verdict : The movie can definitely been seen more than once at a theater if you get the tickets. It is gonna be a houseful for some days.,Special 26

AND one more thing : All PANDEYz of bollywood please stay aside as this PANDEY is something extraordinary with his hand on script and direction. lets move back to film. film starts with a bang (Heist) which stuns you more because of body language of characters and the direction (ofcourse background score should get the praise too) film moves to some rom-com plot suddenly but without making you bore. First half was good but when the second half starts it takes it to another level. beyond our imagination and a amazing climax leaves you thrilled. film keeps you on the edge of seat throughout the 2 and half hour. astonishing sets,superb background score,tight script,marvelous performance and NEERAJ PANDEY. lets say the later NAME is enough to make you expect the unexpected. lets have a look to the performances : Manoj Bajpayee is amazing. one more time he gave his BEST and i don't think its necessary to say he is one of the most talented actor bollywood ever have. Anupam kher is also awesome with all his body language and dialogue delivery stuff. BUT this man AKSHAY was the show stealer. He did something out of the box and did it so brilliantly that you will remember him as his character name AJJU more than akshay. A film not to miss this weekend. All the abusive words got silenced and its a clean family entertainer with all the element to entertain and thrill you. missing such a cinematic experience will be a crime for a movie buff and bollywood lover.

It makes me happy to know that films like this are still being made. Every single actor's performance was phenomenal. The cinematography is just right to match the mood and feeling of the story.

If you see any films this month, makes sure this is one of themFirst time helmer Destin Cretton, with two years' experience in a similar care-giving facility (The title refers to the 12 or so group homes for teens in the county), has masterfully relayed the love and sorrow inherent in a place where virtually everyone is displaced from a parent, or abused, even the staff.The story belongs to Grace (Brie Larson), a caring giver who influences for good many of her charges, not easy cases any one of them. Part of the reason she is so successful is that she knows from abuse by her father, who is in prison for his offenses. She finds a younger Doppelganger of sorts in defiant teen Jadyn (Kaitlyn Dever), whose traumas at the hands of her father are ongoing and call for identifying with Grace's experiences and strong remedy. Watch for an Oscar nomination if this indie is seen by enough of us.To parallel the challenges of the home, Grace's home with fellow staffer, boyfriend Mason is both loving and stressful because she struggles with becoming pregnant and reconciling her tortured past with her father, who is ready to be released form prison. Mason is the ideal caregiver, loving and competent with the teenagers and her.Although many moments could be melancholic or downright tear-jerking in other hands, Cretton doesn't allow excessive sorrow to rule; rather, the sadness is mitigated by the small triumphs. Hey, that's just like real life. This little indie will cure you of any longing for summer blockbusters and their half-billion-dollar entanglements.

466,The Raid 2,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2949836/,"Being said, this is the Sundance Edition; extremely brutal and uncut violence. It was amazing to hear how the editing had just finished (on Sunday) only a couple days before the first screening (on Tuesday)for Sundance. The level of expectations of surpassing the Raid: Redemption will not disappoint any action junkies. A barrage of set-action sequences from a muddy prison (uncontrollable chaos) to several people being decimate with the use of a baseball bat and a pair of claw hammers (with close-up gore that can only rival horror movies), a fantastic car chase that might have been the one of the very best choreographed sequence in recent memory and a final fight scene that will leave you breathless from its intensity and insanity.The plot is of a familiar ""storyline"", yet there are somber moments from a few characters that help drive the emotional aspect (especially from the main character's quiet reconnection with his family). It does feel a bit choppy in certain scenes but, for a 2 1/2 hr movie, it really does fly on by.The final fight scene completely out-shined the first Raid. Quite honestly, it really was an edge-of-your-seat moment. As the director explains his reason of making such a movie during a Q&A, (paraphrasing) ""I wanted to make a movie that I wanted to see and hopefully there'll be several hundred people who will enjoy it too.""",The Raid 2
467,The Imitation Game,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3140098/,"I am astonished at the rave reviews this film is getting and depressed  at how many people will now go through life with their impression of  Alan Turing and code breaking at Bletchley ""informed"" by this film.  The plot is drivel. If you take this film at face value you will leave  believing that Turing was single-handedly responsible for just about  everything at Bletchley including the original idea for the Bombe  machine not to mention constructing it on his own in a barn,  recruitment of staff, the first breaking of any Enigma traffic, the  idea of using known words to crack messages, making strategic decisions  about whether or not to save trans-Atlantic convoys and countless other  things.  Most of the film is just nonsense. There is no way that Turing would  have been in a position to decide not to save the convoy (or even know  that there was one to save). He wasn't responsible for the idea of  using standard text in messages as ways into the Enigma settings (which  had been done since before the war). The construction of the Bombe  machines was a huge exercise involving a team of technicians and parts  supplied by external manufacturers, not Turing wiring it up alone in a  barn in his shirt-sleeves. It wasn't actually even his idea; the idea  of using a machine was brought to him by Dilly Knox from pre-war ideas  worked up by a Polish team. Nor could the machine spit out deciphered  messages after a couple of minutes. Turing wasn't in charge either, he  didn't come up with ideas of using crosswords to find recruits and he  wasn't alone in writing to Churchill; several of them signed the  letter. Oh yes, and there were several women code-breakers at  Bletchley.  The screenplay is also riddled with anachronisms, which just add to the  sense of ""Oh this is ridiculous"" throughout the film. No way would a  well brought up young lady in the 1940s say ""Oh my God!"" three times in  as many minutes. There are too many others to recall or mention.  Benedict Cumberbatch and the rest of the cast are excellent in their  roles with the material they are given (hence two stars rather than  one) but that cannot save what is ultimately a very disappointing film.  This is not a biopic of Turing, which is how it is presented, but a  nonsensical made up story tacked on to a heavy-handed political point  about homosexuality, which we all got without the banner at the end.  Two hours I won't get back.",The Imitation Game
468,The Imitation Game,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3105539/,"Truly excellent film and definitely Ocsar worthy material for both the film and the actors. The entire cast are amazing.As Cumberbatch says near the start of the film ""are you paying attention"". You should pay attention, Alan Turing deserves your attention, his story deserves to be told.I went to see this at the London Film Festival last week and I am going to be one of the first ones in the cue to see it when it comes out next month. It is an excellently paced and executed script that has you gripped from beginning to end. The whole audience were laughing and applauding and crying in places, including the man next to me who had to borrow a hankie from his wife.The film switches between the drive of the team of code breakers to solve the Enigma code, young Alan Turing and the events after the war that destroyed his life. It is truly heartbreaking in places, and Benedict Cumberbatch's performance as Alan Turing is outstanding. He really deserves an Oscar nomination for his performance.It has been a very, VERY long time since I enjoyed a film so much, that when I came out of the Cinema I wanted to turn right round and go back in and watch it again. A lovely script that had you switching back and forwards between tears and laughter.I know some wanted a more in depth and in detail look at Alan Turing's life and have commented frequently that this does no focus enough on his sexuality or the events after the war.In this case I think less is more, this film highlights the man and the mind. It shows us the genius that was destroyed by a society that was seriously homophobic. It brings to life the man behind the facts and we laugh at his interactions with his fellow code breakers and cheer as he proves his theories and our hearts break as we watch him try to cope after his court case.One of the best films I have seen in a long time.

469,Guardians of the Galaxy,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6074284/,"Guardians of the Galaxy is a great film by fantastic director James Gunn that tells the tale of Peter Quill, or Star-Lord as he likes to call himself, and hos band of misfits Rocket, Groot, Gamora and Drax as they make their way from plan to plan, ending up in the clutches of the Ravagers, a high security NOVA prison and ultimately squaring off against a powerful Kree warlord who wants nothing but control and destruction. The excellent cinematography combined with a star-studded cast make this an engaging film that threads the line between explosions and emotional conflicts that will win your heart over, if Rocket's hilarious outbursts or Drax's literal personality havent done so already. My only gripes with the film come from odd holes in the plot such as Rocket and Groot going from wanting to turn Peter into the authorities for a handsome sum of units to risking their lives with him on a dangerous suicide mission or the sudden attitude change for the main characters as they go from wanting to kill each other to being ""best friends"". My assumption is that Gunn was restricted by the length of the film, but nonetheless it does make for a slightly jarring jump in character development.

479,The King's Speech,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2309381/,"This is a biopic about how King George VI, the father of Queen Elizabeth II, overcame his stuttering problem. Widely considered by all but his father unfit to be king, George is reluctantly thrust unto the throne and into the spotlight after his brother is forced to abdicate. Overshadowed on the global stage by powerful orators like Adolph Hitler and Benito Mussolini, the King relies on the help of a little-known Australian speech therapist named Lionel Logue to find his voice and courageously lead his people into the most devastating war humanity has ever faced.This is a powerful, hilarious and deeply moving story, told against the backdrop of a critical juncture in modern history, of the emergence of a deep friendship out of a professional relationship between two men who would otherwise never have socially interacted. The screenplay, written by David Seidler (who also wrote Tucker: The Man and his Dream), is excellent. The dry British wit is hilarious. I was literally slapping my knee during some of the scenes. Tom Hooper (Elizabeth I) does a superb job directing this movie. The buildup to the climactic finale is skillfully executed and prompted the audience to erupt into spontaneous applause. (Apparently, this also happened at the Roy Thomson Hall premiere.) Geoffrey Rush (Elizabeth: The Golden Age) does a fantastic job as Lionel Logue and Colin Firth (A Single Man) is excellent as King George VI.I saw the second public screening of this movie at the Ryerson Theater during the Toronto International Film Festival (TIFF). Tom Hooper was present to introduce the movie. He was joined by Colin Firth and Geoffrey Rush after the movie ended for a brief Q&A.It turns out that David Seidler also had a stuttering problem as a child and drew inspiration from the king's struggle. Early in his career he wanted to write a screenplay about it. He dutifully asked the Queen Mother for permission. She agreed but told him ""not in my lifetime"". Little did he know she would live to be 101 and he would have to wait another 30 years.Another interesting tidbit we learned was that near the end of the shoot, the crew finally located one of Lionel Logue's grandsons, who just so happened to live about 10 minutes away from the director. They got access to Lionel's diaries and correspondence and managed to incorporate some of it into the script.This movie is an unqualified must see.",The King's Speech

But it wasn't fiction--at least, the depiction of Southern society wasn't. As I watched I kept drifting back to small-town South Carolina in the 1950s, where I grew up. It was moving and disturbing to be reminded how black people were treated then--loved and yet ""kept down in their place."" Our neighborhood was all middle-class and every family had a maid. There were plenty of boys my age, we visited in each other's homes, and called every maid by her first name. One even started a baseball team for the little white boys, for which her reward was a visit by the Klan.Our maid helped my mother cook and clean. One of my parents picked her up and took her home every day--and she rode in the back seat. She ate her lunch in our kitchen--without being allowed to use our utensils. I remember her eating with her fingers. I do not remember ever seeing her use our bathrooms. I thought about that during the movie and truly cannot recall what she did, an embarrassing gap in memory.I do remember when my father was out of work and our maid had to be cut back to three days a week. I actually cried; she was a member of our family. When talk about civil rights began in the late 1950s, my mother became annoyed at our maid for getting ""uppity."" And so it went. We moved to central Florida in 1961, where there were no maids.Travel back in time with this film. It's quite real, and I highly recommend it.",N/A
481,Darbareye Elly,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2167145/,"About Elly is as simple as it is enigmatic as its eponymous character. The story is simple, the events are tragic, the characters are wretched, mendacious and judgmental about an unfathomable misfit, the beginning is celebratory, wild and self-congratulatory, the ending is mournful, sepulchral and recriminatory and the whole is superlative and deserving of a quarter-of-an-hour standing ovation for the now great Iranian director Asghar Farhadi.Three Iranian families set out to the Caspian Sea for three days. Accompanying them are Ahamd, the excellent Shahab Hosseini, who has come back from Germany as a widower to stay in Iran for a short time seemingly looking for a wife and Elly, Taraneh Alidoosti's character, who is a kindergarten teacher and unhappily engaged to somebody back in Tehran which is unknown to every body but Sepideh, the brilliant Golshifteh Farahani. As a matchmaker, Sepideh brokers the introduction between Ahmad and Elly. Everything goes smoothly except for a little hiccup in the villa arrangement which results in them nicely settling in an abandoned villa with broken windows, with no proper toilet, without a cell phone signal reception and precariously close to the sea as the families have three recalcitrant children. They joke, make fun of each other, mime, play volleyball until the news that Arash, Peyman's little son, has gone missing in the sea is broken. That is when the bubble bursts. They manage to reclaim him from the sea alive. No sooner are they relieved of the overwhelming shock than a second news flash comes relentlessly: Elly has disappeared into the thin air. Has she drowned in her altruistic and heroic effort to rescue the soon-to-be-dead boy? Has she abandoned the band unawares? And questions of that ilk which are left to be answered by the rest enlisting their judgmental prowess about the character and background of a person even whose name is a total mystery. That is where the inner layers of the characters crawl out of the patina of suavity and are laid bare. With their illusions punctured and hopes dashed, they give a back seat to their gentility in favor of a peer and marital slanging match, fracas and recrimination.Thanks to the taut and tightly knit script, all is compelling, limpid and cogent. The virtuoso camera-work is also a particular boon which helps drag the audience all along and leave them mesmerized and quizzical. When they hear of Arash having gone missing, the initial bacchanalia and revelry turns into a real hell and in a helter-skelter search for him, they dash to the epicenter of the disaster while the camera follows them intensely and with such a frisson as if it were an involved party and were about to stumble.Part of the appeal is also the inspiring performances turned in by each and every one of the actors. In a bravura performance, Farahani effortlessly disappears into her character and weaves a web of lies to paper over the cracks developed as a result of her indiscretion. This knack for churning out lies convinced Hollywood talent scouts to choose her for Ridley Scotts' ""Body of Lies"".About Elly is a movie which preserves some of its flavor for a second viewing as some scenes make more sense only in retrospect, especially the pantomime scene which reminds me of the scene in Antonioni's ""blowup"". With this movie, Farhadi has opened up new horizons for the Iranian cinema industry. I tip my hat off to him.",About Elly
482,Darbareye Elly,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2045143/,"The most remarkable thing about this Berlin Silver Bear directing (Asghar Farhadi) winner is that despite all the suspense and tension, what it is about is so ordinary daily life that it could easily happen to anybody, anywhere. What is gripping is the way the story is told through a volatile camera and how the underlying human characters and emotions are explored.The follow recap of events up to the first 45 minutes of this 2-hour film is technically not a spoiler, as I wouldn't even reveal details of the major incident that is the crucial turning point. And yet, it is a spoiler in the sense that some of the background only come out in the second half of the film, simply through dialogue of the character, that is, no convoluted flash back or time scramble which apparently still hasn't gone out of fashion in Hollywood.11 people (4 man, 4 women, 3 kids) from Tehran drives to a seaside (the Caspian) resort for a 3-day holiday. There is however a hidden agenda. Seven of the adults are close friends  2 couple, brother-and-sister pair and a single guy Ahmad (Shahab Hosseini) who just got divorced. The wife of one of the couples, Sepideh (Golshifteh Farahani), invites a pretty young woman along in the last minute, a match-making gambit for the divorced friend. Elly (Taraneh Alidousti) the attractive outsider is Sepideh's kid's teacher at the nursery school. It turns out that Sepideh doesn't even know her last name. What Sepideh does know though, is that Elly is engaged, but willing to come along because she is trying to get out of the relationship with her fiancé (Saber Abar). This Sepideh hides from everybody. In the first 45 minutes, the audience follows with mild interest the progress of this modern, middle-class group's seaside vacation and gets to gradually recognize some of the character, obvious starting with Elly and Ahmad. But something happens, switching the tone of the film quite abruptly, and the audience follows the film with gripping attention to the end.I must re-emphasize that there is no convoluted plots, credibility-stretching events and the likes of such that flood Hollywood movies. Everything that happens, as well as the people's reaction, is something that you and I can relate easily to our ordinary experience. The power of the film is derived from the way in which some of the facts unfold, to the audience as well as to the characters in the film. This is drama, suspense and tension in real life.The acting is excellent although the cast is unknown, with the exception of Golshifteh Farahani who acted opposite Leonardo DiCaprio in ""Body of lies"" (2008) as the charming nurse his characters falls in love with. The Iran depicted in this film is modern  except for the headscarf, the women are no different from what you'll find in any big city in the Western society. People's emotions and reaction to event and situations are quite universal. The human nature probed in this film, therefore, can be easily empathized with.",N/A

But the more disappointing part is I came back and read reviews and so far only found good ones. But then I noticed something. All the reviews were saying how different it is from the typical Bollywood movie. No review said why they truly enjoyed the film. So yes, if your going to talk about it being different from Bollywood movies then yes, it was a great movie. But as a movie by itself, then no.So many movies are different from typical Bollywood that 'different' should stop being taken into consideration as the only good aspect of the movie. A movie shouldn't be judged and given good ratings just because its not the usual Shahrukh movie. India has been making different movies right from the good old black and white days of the Apu Trilogy. Here is a short list of some other good 'different' films - Everyone says I'm fine, No Smoking, Missed Call, Hyderabad Blues and many more. So coming back to Dev.D, as a stand alone movie was it good? Not at all. As an experiment or something different from Bollywood? Sure. And here are my reasons:The characters didn't ever show any emotional connection, which in turn left the viewer never being able to feel for the character, specially for Dev. I probably felt a little for Chanda. But that's it. Dev really didn't have that much going on in his life to be so upset that he had to go out and get wasted or high every night. His love for Paro was never so strong to begin with. He came back to India just to get laid. This was very clearly depicted in the film. And even after meeting Paro he just wanted to get laid. So his whole 2 hours that followed felt like a waste of the two hours coz it never felt like he wanted to that bad to begin with! The whole confusion between Paro and Dev about her sleeping around with many people was such a childlike fight because really, how hard would it have been for them to figure out the truth, all they needed to do was have a 5 minute talk. Anurag, come on. You should know better. And the music. I usually always remember the score after a film. Except for the way it was shot and lit everything else was poor. Being a friend of Anurag I was extra disappointed because I had such high expectations for the film. I read the other review on IMDb and it was quite evident that the writer, like many people in India are right now, was just infatuated by Kashyap and will take anything to fill the hole in them that Bollywood has created, but in the process will forget how good a movie really is. Therefore its important to watch movies from all around the world, because sure, if you only watch Bollywood then this movie will surely blow you away.",Dev.D
484,My Name Is Khan,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2182826/,"Just back from the Mumbai Fox office after watching portions of the final edit of My Name is Khan. Fox guys were really keen whether the $16 million they spent in buying the rights are justified? The answer is a resounding yes. This film is gonna blow away mainstream Hollywood if properly marketed. Shah Rukh Khan is in the role of his lifetime and as Rizwan Khan, he is in his best performance ever. Kajol is at her usual best and the chemistry between the leading pair is something to die for. The climax is the crux of the movie, and the 2nd half is so compelling that people will just stand up and give a standing ovation to the maker, Karan Johar. Shibani Bathija needs to be credited for such an awesome screenplay, and Ravi Chandran's cinematography gives the film an international look. The theme is tailor made for North America, and as I already mentioned, if marketed properly, this one has potential to gross $20-30 million in North America alone. Having said that, being primarily a love story, it has all the right items to hit the Indian box office. Due to the lead pair coming back after 10 years, the hype in India is inexplicable. Overall, I would give it a 8.5/10 rating, and advise everyone to celebrate Valentine's with KHAN.",My Name is Khan
485,My Name Is Khan,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2865996/,"I saw this with my family in a theatre. Superb film.
Found the movie to b a bit drag at times. No overacting by Srk this time. I ain't no fan of Srk but in this movie he was decent. He got into the character this time. Kajol was good. The flood scenes were a bit cheesy n unnecessary. Nonetheless a decent watch. It deals with racism, loss, stigma about a particular community, communal hatred, hope, perseverance.
If you want your life to be rocked go see it. A really wonderful film which should not be missed. Don't be put off because it is an Indian film, this is much better than ""copycat BARFI"" and much more worthy of Oscar nomination which it has missed.",N/A
486,The Breath,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2142557/,"Nefes is first of its kind in Turkey. Through the eyes of a small brigade of soldiers stationed at the border, the film examines the armed conflict that has been going on for more than 30 years in south-eastern Turkey.Filmed on the high mountains of southern Turkey, the landscape provides a stunning and poetic backdrop. The seclusion, hardship and the tragedy these people had to endure is central to the story.The film has its minor flaws but nevertheless it is effective in putting the audience in the shoes of these soldiers. And it is specifically significant to the Turkish citizens; for they will have a chance to truly empathize with those who rendered services in the region.",Nefes
487,The Breath,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2148114/,"This movie is based on a an event of incursion of the small military stationery located at the top of the Mountains in Semdinli (Southeastern border of Turkey) by a PKK terrorist group in 1993. Despite of being a Azeri Turk, I tried to watch and discuss this movie objectively. Why this movie deserves to be watched? Because: This is a unique Turkish movie that incorporated humor, grief, reality, originality, art and most of all simplicity in performance. The acting was pure and simple much like as an original Turkish soldier. A bunch of soldiers from different regions of Turkey connected in a quest. None of them actors were celebrities in real life. Made an impression that I would see and do the same things and have the same conversations if I were in military in some other place. I think nothing is exaggerated in the story and it has an objective opinion on the terrorism but explains it from the Turkish side of view. I've never seen such a pure and simple acting that made me feel in their shoes. The 'calling home' part of the movie is one of the greatest parts. In those couple of minutes I realized that it could be me, my friend (who is a doctor and made his military duty at the same region) or my relative. Don't know how other people would feel but every single Turk watching this movie will see a part of themselves in those soldiers' life. The director is very very successful in transmitting the atmosphere and he deserves a special mention for mastery in simplifying that movie which seems to be actually complicated in it's nature. The artistic scenery especially from a photographic view is another thing that made me feel proud and happy as a photographer. The music at the background successfully synchronized with the events and moods during the entire movie. Finally, the movie is named as 'Nefes' which stands for 'the breath' and is explained in such a conversation that touched me deeply: 'In the fight what matters is breath: whether you 'take' it or 'give' at the end!'...I'd advise anyone to watch this movie... You'll definitely like the cinematography, directing, acting and most of all this is one of the best achievements in Turkish cinema in my opinion...Watch it!",Nefes
488,Slumdog Millionaire,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1942705/,"This movie was one of the best movies that I have seen so far at the Toronto International Film Festival. This film is beautifully filmed as Danny Boyle can do. He is a film master. The acting is magnificent as well. Imagine using 3 children under the age of 7 to tell the early part of the story plot. The film uses past tense, and present tense to tell the whole story, which is also seamless. Filming took place in India as well. Their was a question and answer after the showing of this film at TIFF-Toronto International Film Festival. Please go and see this film. This film is has and exceptional cast, and should be seen in the theaters. It was magnificent.",N/A

This story is told seamlessly. The  revealing look into the Mumbai slum is just one of the beautiful and  terrifying story lines. The use of flashbacks to tell the story took  you on a journey in time and culture. They used three sets of actors of  three different ages to move the story. The use of the youngest actors  (actually slum kids from Mumbai) stole the show. These kids were  incredible showing both the beauty and the horrors of growing up in Bombay. And that's not to take away from the amazing  performances of Freida, Dev, and the actor playing the older Saleem.  There performances moved many to tears.

490,Black Swan,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2369977/,"Well, I lost track. Seriously. I am still astonished at the high rating it had here at IMDb (which rarely lets me down) as that is what encouraged me to go.Natalie Portman, whether the white swan or black swan, is an expressionless member of the chorus selected by the choreographer to play the lead in Swan Lake. Inexplicably, I might add, when there are far more talented dancers around her.She is a one-note swan. Her facial expression never varies from sad, purse-mouthed and leaky eyed. I got so tired of looking at her face and it is shown just about all the time. To top it off, I felt absolutely no connection with any other character as the movie wound excruciatingly along on its hopeless execrable way to nowhere.The lack of script is a serious flaw: but the graphic detail of what she does do is laid out: she vomits, she slashes herself, she lives with her mother, she has lesbian sex - sorta, but she has no background, no character, apart from mommy's girl, no friends, no interactions with others apart from the briefest of convos about ballet. The mother is completely cardboard - with matching dialogue - ""I gave up my career for you, poor me"".This comes across as a horror movie with an unnecessary disgust factor aiming for the roof. I covered my eyes many times. Not in fear but in a kind of shame that a movie could be this bad. It is not even a good ballet movie, the dance sequences are choppy compounded by the uneven hand of the director everywhere.When the audience started to laugh about 1/3 of the way through, I knew it was all hopeless. I joined in, that's how appallingly bad it all was. In the final scene, the laugh meter topped out. It is that unbelievable and unintentionally comedic.1 out of 10 from me as minuses are not allowed.Avoid.",Black Swan
491,Elite Squad,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1750290/,"""Tropa de Elite"" isn't merely one more Brazilian film on urban violence; it's a cathartic socio-cultural phenomenon of almost unprecedented proportions in Brazil, the omnipresent theme on TV talk shows, newspapers articles, bars and dinner tables. Prior to its theatrical release this October, ""Tropa"" was seen by an estimated record 11 million people who bought pirate DVD copies or illegally downloaded it on the net (the biggest Brazilian box-office success in the last 25 years was ""2 Filhos de Francisco"" with 5,5 million tickets sold).The reaction is passionately polarized: some call it the best Brazilian movie since ""City of God"" -- a definite influence here, in the cinematography, editing and screenplay structure, with an omniscient narrator and use of mixed chronology -- exposing the endemic corruption of Rio de Janeiro's police force and the ""unorthodox"" methods used by BOPE (the self-called ""incorruptible"" elite squad of Rio's military police force, created in 1978 and inspired by the U.S. SWAT) that include torture and shoot-first-ask-later modus operandi in the ultra-violent, ever-growing drug war in Rio's favelas. Others have publicly attacked it as fascist in its glorification of BOPE, its sadistic depiction of torture and the reductionist, simple-minded vision of the complex issues involving violence/ drugs/police corruption in Rio. Director José Padilha and co-writer Rodrigo Pimentel (a former BOPE captain who left the squad for disagreeing with its praxis) had collaborated in the extraordinary ""Bus 174"", a multi-faceted documentary on Rio's violence. In ""Tropa"", they controversially chose to give us a deliberately biased vision of the problem: from the start we're stuck with one man, the overstressed, rebellious, self-righteous Capt Nascimento (Wagner Moura) in his journey into becoming a psychopathic sadist and hot-blooded killer, who believes drug traffic is caused by the druggie middle-class bourgeoisie (as if the poor didn't do drugs!) and claims the solution is to kill all traffickers. To Nascimento, corruption is abominable; torture isn't.Nascimento is the film's absolute protagonist, narrator, commentator and ""truth-puker"". In his mind, all non-elite policemen are corrupt and incompetent, all charity NGOs in the favelas are cover-up fraudulent enterprises, all college students are useless double-faced potheads, and legal procedures are an inefficient waste of time. He's nearer to the traffickers' violent, revenge-based, lawless ethics than he's ever able to realize.""There's nothing wrong with shooting people if you shoot the right people"", used to say Clint Eastwood's Dirty Harry back in the 1970s, and it could well be Capt. Nascimento's motto. He's a vigilante in uniform, in the tradition of the executioners played by Eastwood, Bronson, Stallone and 24 Hours' Jack Bauer; he's the heir to the 1970s' Brazilian military regime know-how on torture. Yet, the film tries hard at ""humanizing"" Nascimento: his wife's pregnant, his marriage falters, he's moved to tears by the suffering of a mother who lost her son in the traffic war, he's in medication for his panic attacks. AND he's trying to save the POPE's life, no less! All the other characters are just rough sketches or caricatures. The one character who might be the classical ""narrator/observer"" (like Buscapé/Rocket in ""City of God"") is the idealist, Foucault-reading aspiring police officer Mathias (though it's hard to believe an aspiring officer could afford to attend Rio's most expensive law school). But Mathias, too, is finally co-opted by the brainwashing ""Full-Metal-Jacket""-like BOPE training that changes him into an amoral beast fueled with rage.Padilha says he wanted to portray Nascimento as a monster, and that audiences who are hailing Nascimento as a ""hero"" and BOPE as a ""model"" institution have caught him by surprise -- oh, really? Padilha is probably being sarcastic, naive or silly: everybody knows movie vigilante cops have been consistently idolized the world over (and co- writer Pimentel has publicly disagreed, stating the ""Tropa"" is clearly pro-BOPE). The graphic, sadistic scenes of torture -- supposedly meant to inspire disgust -- make the delight of a large vigilante-minded part of the audience. And Wagner Moura's extraordinary, scary performance as Nascimento is unsettling: we can't dismiss him as a stupid fascist the way we dismissed inarticulate stiffs like Bronson, Seagal or Stallone. The fact is that there's now a BOPE cult-following, with BOPE's logo (a skull pierced by pistols and knives) reproduced on t-shirts and underwear, BOPE officers being cheered in the streets in their armored ""glory"", and young kids (from all social classes) mimicking the film's ""bag-in-the-head torture"" as a new bullying style. Militarists and pacifists will hardly change sides after the watching the film; militarists will have multiple orgasms and pacifists will cringe in horror. The filmmakers aren't interested in seriously discussing the drug issue (legalization is not even mentioned as an option). Nor in exposing Rio's drug traffic's multi-fingered interconnections, the zillion-dollar, highly organized international business involving farmers, money-washing executives, chemistry labs, gun-runners, bankers, politicians, accountants, lawyers, transport systems, etc. Nor in showing the real victims: the majority of the favela inhabitants, who aren't involved in the drug business but have to live under its rules, mere ""extras"" whose fate (in movies and in real life) is to be used, humiliated, segregated or, worse, wounded/killed by random bullets from BOTH policemen and traffickers. ""Tropa"" is a must-see film, but it's misleading and entrapping: by opting for an ""open"", ""what would YOU do?"" ending (probably influenced by the breathtaking finale of ""Paradise Now""), the filmmakers demands us to take sides about a very, VERY complex issue they've shown us only ONE angle of. ""Tropa"" is cinematically dazzling, but so physically and ideologically nauseating you'll need an antidote -- be sure to also watch the faceted, influential documentary ""Notícias de uma Guerra Particular"" and be aware of many other angles to a terrible reality that plagues not only Rio, but most of Third World's chaotic, no-man's-land, way out-of- control big cities.",Tropa de Elite
492,Elite Squad,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1762676/,"Tropa de Elite is an amazingly good film; by turns brutally real and horrifyingly hilarious.It claims to be based on a true story and I find that sadly believable. The main plot revolves around the captain of an elite police unit trying to find a replacement for himself, while dealing with the birth of his child and the horrendous stress of his job, and a mission to clear out a dangerously violent slum.There are no wholly good people in the movie, and it's frighteningly easy to compare some of what goes on to things happening in the USA (and other places) today. That said, the system of government and policing portrayed comes across as so amazingly inept and awful that it's almost like something straight out of a nightmarish sci-fi dystopia.If I had to compare it to other movies, it comes off as a cross between Brazil, Office Space, and Full Metal Jacket. Not for the weak of stomach, and you may find yourself greatly disagreeing with the ideals of various groups portrayed (which I believe is part of the point), but I would be enormously surprised if this movie doesn't make you think and give you something to talk about.",Tropa de Elite
493,Persepolis,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1817651/,"Persepolis is a lovingly,hand drawn animated feature film from France, that tells the story of a young girl growing up in Iran,the daughter of left wing revolutionary parents,during the Islamic revolution. It spans something like 13 years in her life, from childhood,adolescence to early adulthood. It was taken from a graphic novel,published in France. Most of the prints in circulation are the French language version, but there is an English dubbed version (I thankfully saw the original French version,with English subtitles). What I really admired was the carefully nuanced use of colour (most of the flashback sequences are in black & white). In an era that is now overblown with 3D computer generated animation, it's refreshing to see somebody kicking it old school style (hand drawn). This is a film that is worth seeking out.",Persepolis
494,Persepolis,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1803091/,"I rated this film a 9 more as a visual complement to the comic book (of two volumes, now bound as one), which I believe to be a masterpiece. If you left the film less than emotionally attached to the characters, PLEASE give the book a chance, because, as is often the case, episodes and histories of a lot of the characters, including Marjane, are left out to adapt the story to a film medium. Having said that, there are great sequences, expressionistic animation, and the wiseass grandma is left fully intact from the books! I can understand why some people weren't emotionally compelled by it though, since the movie doesn't take the time to fill the audience in on all the quirkiness and endearing qualities of the characters as Satrapi originally conceived them.",N/A
495,Dallas Buyers Club,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3448820/,"This is a difficult film to watch, as the subject matter is very grim and it hails back to those scary, depressing years of the mid- eighties when people across the world were dropping like flies with alarming frequency, after contracting HIV-AIDS. Although there is still no absolute cure for AIDS, significant medical progress has been made since those terrible years and these days many people with access to the latest drugs are able to live almost normal lives for many years, and have pretty much normal life-spans.The film is based on the true story of Ron Woodroof, a Texan homophobic electrician, and rodeo performer, who contracted AIDS in the early 80's. He was given thirty days to live by a local hospital but succeeded in remaining alive for seven more years by illegally importing and taking unapproved drugs. Along the way, he starts the Dallas Buyers Club, which is a device by which he is able to provide illegal drugs to fellow sufferers free of charge in return for paying a club membership fee. He also modifies his homophobic attitude and he strikes up a close friendship with a transvestite who becomes his business partner.Rumbling along in the background of this tale is Woodruff's battle with the authorities, particularly the FDA, who have serious objections to his drug buying and distribution activities and continually battle to shut him down, put him in jail and deprive him and others of drugs that can clearly prolong their lives. It has taken more than 20 years to bring this story to the screen, which is hardly surprising, given the seemingly unappealing storyline. When it finally went into production, it had a scant budget of only $5.5 million and the entire film was shot in a mere 25 days.Yet this low-budget film that was put together in less time than it takes most film producers to choose their cast has so far grossed $27million in the USA as at April 2014 and no doubt continued to put countless more 'bums on seats' in the following months. It garnered 6 Oscar nominations and won three, including Best Actor and Best Supporting Actor.Dallas Buyers Club is a shining example of one of my favourite hobby-horses - that Hollywood doesn't need to spend obscene amounts of money to make good, successful films – but that's an argument for another day. In my opinion, Dallas Buyers Club succeeds because, in spite of the deeply depressing subject matter, it tells the story of a man who refuses to meekly accept his predicted demise, and rails against the bureaucracy and authorities who would have him pass away quickly and without a fuss. By taking things into his own hands, he not only prolongs his own life, but also those of his fellow sufferers. It is a classic David and Goliath story: a dying, badly educated, Texan hick, against the might of the American government.But none of the above would have made the film stand out from the crowd if it wasn't for the quite extraordinary performance in the lead role by Mathew McConaughey. It really is a 'tour de force.' Not only did McConaughey look the part, (he lost so much weight that he must have been in imminent danger of collapsing from malnutrition), but he positively acted his hind teeth off.In my personal opinion, I did think that the portrayal of Woodroof's extreme and outrageously homophobic behaviour at the start of the movie was a bit over the top. If we accept the fact that he was a bigoted, ignorant Texan, it just didn't ring true (to me) that such an intolerant homophobe could dramatically change his ultra-extreme views in such a short space of time – even given the unique circumstances. To my surprise, after I had seen the movie, I found that my views are indeed valid.Amongst others, there is an article in The Dallas Morning News, commenting on the accuracy of the film, which states that:""people who knew him said that he was not homophobic While Woodroof was known for outlandish behaviour, according to those who knew him both the film and McConaughey made him rougher than he actually was, describing him as ""outrageous, but not confrontational"" and not as obviously homophobic earlier in his life.""The opening scenes, in which Woodroof is mind-bogglingly abusive towards gays and the gay community, are amongst the most uncomfortable to watch in the whole movie. I can kind of see the justification in showing a dramatic contrast between his original homophobia with his later, more moderate behaviour, but I do think it is a shame that this aspect of the story is patently untrue. It seems to have been a cynical ploy to get more bums on seats. This is my only criticism, as the film romps along at a good pace and holds your interest throughout, so if you think this is the kind of dramatic movie that might tickle your fancy, then you could do a lot worse than Dallas Buyers Club.It is well directed, beautifully acted, (not only by McConaughey, but also by the rest of the much-talented cast), and although you suspect the final outcome, it doesn't detract from a genuine desire to know how it all goes down. You will empathise with the victims of this dread disease and most viewers will feel uplifted by the film's portrayal of the indomitable human spirit.Go for it!",Dallas Buyers Club
496,Dallas Buyers Club,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2911005/,"Much has already been written about Matthew McConaughey and Jared Leto's astonishing transformations, and brilliant performances. Solid and true, yes. They both deserve enormous accolades, Golden Globe and AMPAS-worthy, for these transformations and the effort of their craft. But I think the true heroes of this project are the Producers who took a chance on such dicey subject matter. Some reviews hail the project as ""A Crowd Pleaser,"" and yet, you realise, these are TRULY marginal characters, and not entirely likable, as some have already said, in an Era (1970s-1980s early AIDS crisis) that is nearly forgotten in this age of HIV exposure-as-a-managed-care-condition, rather than a death sentence, as it was between 1979-1995. As much as this could be a feel-good film for the discovery and pioneer of protease inhibitor cocktails, it is a compelling character study of a time of crisis that has not been well-captured or documented adequately in quite some time. BRAVO to the Producers of this movie for giving this project the Greenlight, because the sexually-active youth of today would never know the Plague and tragedy that preceded their coming-of-age without a reminder like this.",N/A
497,The Pursuit of Happyness,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1585485/,"Am I the only person who saw this film and hated it? The main problem for me was that Will Smith's character irritated me to death. All his problems seemed to me to be of his own making. We see him buying up his stock of scanners before his child is born. This means he has at least 5 years to realise that he isn't making enough money to survive and to get a proper job.What's admirable about a guy who is still running round trying to sell a product he knows is unpopular (and probably out of date by this stage) when he knows he is not paying his rent, not paying his child care, running a car he doesn't need (why not take the bus?) and ducking out of all his responsibilities? His wife is working two jobs and is exhausted and he is still constantly leaving her to pick up the pieces while he runs around town chasing sales. He's supposed to be intelligent but he doesn't even appear to have a rudimentary grasp of how to manage his finances. Why can't he get another job? Why not work two jobs? Somehow we're supposed to feel sorry for him. All I felt was intense irritation and an overwhelming urge to tell him to pull himself together.This film seems to be pushing the message that if you have a dream and go for it you will succeed.

Chris Gardner, played by Will Smith, Is just trying to give his son a good home as he's on the pursuit of happiness. This movie doesn't only show the hard work of a single parent, but it shows that no matter how hard you get pushed down, you should always get up and keep going. I love the strong connection that the father and son roles have in this movie, it seems so real, and that's because it is! The father (Will smith) and son (Jaden Smith) are father and son outside the movie realm too. Actor, Will Smith, shows his true emotional side during this film, as if he was actually going through the situations occurring in the movie. There couldn't have been a better cast picked for this movie, the pain, struggle, love, and hope seem so real as if you're watching a documentary on someone's life.

499,Blood Diamond,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1621250/,"Blood Diamond is an excellent example of how Hollywood formulas can suck the essence out of a unique work of art. The film is exceptionally well done, with great performances, well-written characters, good research and, above all, shocking messages. To all those reviewers who thought it wasn't ""interesting"": Are you kidding me? Three of the most horrible tragedies of our times are shown in the film: - Africa's child-warriors - Militia-led smuggling supporting brutal civil wars and exploiting ancient hatred - The diamond monopoly and its ruthlessness. And the film shows how these are intertwined! If this doesn't touch you, I don't know what will. But perhaps here lies the film's greatest fault. As other reviewers have eloquently mentioned, it apparently thinks it HAS to use Hollywood formulas in order to get the point across to a wide audience: so we have superstars, a romantic subplot, a cheesy ending, lots of action. And this, combined with the heavy messages of the plot, is just too much. It is no coincidence that so many reviewers used words such as ""odd"" and ""confusing"". They didn't mean they didn't follow the film, they just didn't know why it was going there (and back and forth again). Which was my feeling exactly. It's like listening to a beautiful song with great lyrics, and just as the text is about to grasp you, a cheesy sax-solo rises. The film had too many sax-solos for its worth. It touched extremely important issues, but didn't have the guts to look the audience in the eye and scream out: ""Are you finally listening? Look around you!"" The Hollywood gutlessness is best shown in the final comments: They do explicitly mention the diamond industry's exploits, but then they advise the audience to ""demand diamonds from peaceful areas"". What? After having shown that the industry holds prices ridiculously high by convincing everyone that diamonds are valuable as such and oh so rare? And that you just NEED to buy or have diamonds as a sign of class, power, and, most importantly, love... And all the producers want us to do is to ask nicely for a ""good"" diamond?...If that movie touched you, find out more about the diamond brainwash and the African civil war tragedies. Open your eyes.",Blood Diamond
500,Blood Diamond,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1537079/,"Because I lived in Sierra Leone, in fact in Kono, the diamond-mining area of the country, for three years, I had to see Blood Diamond as soon as it came out. It is an excellent movie. Although it was not filmed in Sierra Leone, it captures the reality of the country to a remarkable degree. There is a great deal of violence in this movie, but that violence is organic, realistic, fitting to what happened there. They even manage to convey the fact that the people are as astonished by this violence as we are; Sierra Leone used to be one of the safest countries in the world. The movie tells the facts about conflict diamonds quickly and accurately. DiCaprio's performance is impressive, certainly the best by him I've ever seen: he is totally believable as a white African. Jennifer Connelly's role is much smaller but she makes the most of it. Djiman Housou has enormous physical presence as the brave Mende fisherman. This movie just gets so many things right that the few places it departs from reality are entirely forgivable. I would heartily recommend this movie to everyone; it is the best Hollywood movie I've seen in years.",Blood Diamond
501,The Bourne Ultimatum,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1799343/,"Not being much of a Matt Damon fan, I rarely look forward to any of his films. There are exceptions, of course, most notably his surprisingly great performance in THE GOOD SHEPHERD. But even within The Good Shepherd, Damon's emotional range isn't challenged, which is why the part was perfect for him considering who he was portraying.Part of that issue spills over into this series where we see a super-spy with little-to-no emotions that might help audiences ""feel"" anything for Jason Bourne. But THE BOURNE ULTIMATUM and its predecessors aren't about character, they're about action, and director Greengrass knows action very well. If you think these stories have ANYTHING to do with character, you are seriously deluded. We never understand the motivations behind any of the prime or secondary characters. This is glaringly obvious when Jason and a CIA ""asset"" sent out to eliminate him battle and, eventually, come to some sort of understanding.But, like I said, these stories aren't character pieces but adrenaline pumping action sequences designed as a thrill ride. And on that level expectations are well-met.Running from city to city, this is basically one long chase scene where the CIA learns that Bourne has resurfaced and several key officers within ""The Agency"" don't want him to discover a covert operation that hearkens back to Bourne's uber-secret beginnings.David Strathairn (GOOD NIGHT, AND GOOD LUCK) and Scott Glenn (FREEDOM WRITERS) star as two powerful but ultimately despicable Agency higher-ups who's attempts to snare Jason Bourne are continually foiled by Bourne and someone within their own department.Female leads Joan Allen (THE ICE STORM) and Julia Stiles (THE OMEN, 2006) pull in okay performances; Allen as the sympathetic CIA agent who wants to know why her superiors are so enamored with killing off Jason Bourne, and Stiles as the former love interest who reemerges to initially help Jason but only puts herself in danger and must be saved by Bourne. Although that was a bit confusing (i.e., their relationship history), the rooftop chase through Tangier is flat-out amazing.This is one of those film series' where you need to be in the mood for such things. If you want thoughtful, look elsewhere. But if you want heart-pounding action, you're in for a treat.",The Bourne Ultimatum
502,3-Iron,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0987563/,"Bin-Jip (2004) My personal interest in Ki-Duk Kim appeared some months ago after buying Bad Guy on DVD, that movie challenged and moved a lot, but at the end it did bother me that it contained certain plot holes. Months later my path came across another movie of his, The Isle, while this story were without obvious plot holes it failed to contain the emotional strength that made Bad Guy such a remarkable experience for me. Now, my path has crossed Bin-Jip and I must say that as an overall vote I rate it higher than both The Isle and Bad Guy, but I don't necessarily consider it a better movie. It is a challenging movie that will leave each viewer with a unique interpretation, because, as in other of Ki-Duk Kim's movies it's all about interpreting what happens on the screen.The story, roughly drawn, is about a young man who lives an almost entirely anonymous life, breaking into various houses, fixing things, living their lives, doing their laundry for a little while before he moves onto his next location, a nomad. One day his path comes across a wealthy house in which he finds a wife beaten up. Once the husband returns he hits golf-balls at him with the husband's 3-iron and leaves with the wife, taking her with him on his journeys.The first thing that strikes me on this movie is how extremely slow and quiet it is, it often feels like nothing is happening in the movie at all, but actually a lot manages to happen through those 95 minutes. The challenging part about the movie is interpreting the many changes of mood and morals in the movie and as always with Ki-Duk Kim almost everything is hidden beneath the surface. I don't wanna cross my own interpretation of things in this review as that is impossible without making needless spoilers.Both the acting and the directing is really quite remarkable, the main characters of the movie hardly says anything, actually the lead male doesn't say one single word at all and the female says only 3 words, therefore it can only be considered admirable how many feelings are actually expressed through their faces and movements. The directing is equally brilliant and Ki-Duk brings a powerful and intelligent visual side as he usually does, and of course this movie also includes some fantastic music fitting the mood of the movie perfectly, another typical Ki-Duk detail.As a final note, I'd prefer to say it very directly, if you like to think during your movies this will interest you, especially if you've found Ki-Duk's other work interesting, but if you prefer nonstop action on the screen, you'll be extremely disappointed with this one, because all the action of this movie happens inside each viewers head.8/10",Bin-Jip
503,3-Iron,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1007203/,"Watched it two times the past week. In a nutshell - I dare anyone to find a film that is more sober and so light and that at the same time fills you with a deep warmth an and all encompassing feeling of great tenderness. Really.Its story is of such unbelievable simplicity that at the first sight of such a script you'd wonder how on earth it would be possible to make it into a film - or tell anything with it that goes beyond the script. Add to this the fact that any dialogue almost entirely fails to manifest itself...But then you forget about Kim Ki-duk! If anyone was born with the eye of the cinematographic magician, it must be him. Despite the fact that I did not like The Isle at all, the photography was utterly unbelievable. Same for Spring, Summer... But then I still thought ""well, anyone with reasonable skill can get a good image out of such landscapes/spaces"". But none of that here - mainly indoors or in the city - just a guy spending his nights at other unknown people's places while they're away, and in turn repairs stuff and cleans/does the laundry. And STILL the images are nothing less than breathtaking. The light is superb, the framing, everything... Also the storytelling... pacing is perfect - he tells the story with images more than with events. The film actually becomes light as feather, and then lighter. Sublimation. And besides that, he manages to squeeze in some real drama and the occasional laugh. Go figure.I'm gonna quit here, there's really nothing much more I can add. Do yourself a favour and see this inconspicuous little film that is so profoundly simple and beautiful that you'll be wanting to send me a thank you note afterwards for telling you this.",N/A
504,The Diving Bell and the Butterfly,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2107820/,"A film professing to be based upon a true story should stay true to the story. This one does not. I was so moved by the film after watching it last night, I decided to do some research on Jean-Dominique Bauby. And what did I discover? The truth is, the filmmakers took some serious liberties with the truth, portraying Mr. Bauby's girlfriend as a narcissistic flake who couldn't bring herself to visit her paralyzed lover, while at the same time glorifying the mother of his children as the steadfast, dutiful companion who remained loyal despite Bauby's love for another woman. In fact, the opposite is true. Bauby's girlfriend was constantly by his side, while the mother of his children visited him perhaps three or four times in total. She was traveling with her boyfriend in America when Bauby died in his girlfriend's arms.The real story, as represented in the book and by Bauby's friends, was needlessly altered by the filmmakers. One can only imagine the very real pain and harm the filmmakers have caused to the people who were there for Bauby during his final years. The liberties taken are libel, no doubt about it, and it is a testament to the integrity of the real heroine, Florence, that she has not sued over the abhorrent way in which she is portrayed by this piece of pointlessly subversive garbage.Furthermore, Bauby never asked to die--not once. His speech therapist apparently refused to see the film after reading the lies in the script. The filmmakers apparently have respect neither for the living, nor the dead.I feel cheated by this film. In fact, I feel sick to my stomach. The real story is just as interesting, and equally inspiring--if not more so. Knowing the truth about this film gives one a sense for why collective society is mistaken about so many things. We can thank the arrogance of the entertainment industry--which now includes the news networks--for our ignorance. We must be diligent in our skepticism, and tenacious in our pursuit of the truth. Reality is the only source of true wisdom and understanding.I wish others felt as offended by this film as I do. Disgusting and beneath contempt.",N/A
505,The Diving Bell and the Butterfly,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1760422/,"One of the best films in years, and in artistic cinematic terms, one of the best films I've ever seen. That's a heavy statement to make, but off the top of my head, I cannot think of another film that explores the inner workings of a character so intimately and believably, while blending cinematography, sound effects, and musical score in such harmony -- but in a fashion we (as American's at least) are not trained to enjoy. I felt the French influence strongly cinematically and, of course in the dialogue, but the writing and acting was so fluid it felt like the subtitles weren't even there. The film deals with a rare physical condition, and I was physically there with the character from start to finish. I felt each moment as if it were my own. That is a rare accomplishment in cinema. Julian Schnabel directed a stellar cast. Mathieu Amalric was unusually charming as Jean-Dominique Bauby, and Max Von Sydow was heartbreaking as his lonely widower father. The female leads were all equally impressive as they were beautiful. I don not mean to generalize them, but they were all so excellent that they blend seamlessly in my mind, in terms of performance.Overall, this film was as pure a cinematic experience as I've witnessed in a long time. A true artist turns out a film that is truly a piece of art. Julian Schnabel takes his time in between films, but with work like this, there's no need to rush. Like a good painting, one can enjoy it for a lifetime.",The Diving Bell and the Butterfly
506,G.O.R.A.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0964553/,"After months of advertisement the movie is capable of breaking the audience record in Turkey. Yet, if I try to be objective, disregarding that it is a Turkish film and written by the best comedian in Turkey, I don't think that it was more than average neither as a sci-fi nor as a comedy. Many of the jokes are based on ordinary, sometimes vulgar, slangs that I rarely appreciate as funny. In some scenes the film looks like rather a science fiction with no humorous aspect at all. The references to other films are far from being smart; even I could hardly grasp what was funny in some references. On the other hand, the cast was quite successful. Only Özge Özberk (as Ceku) somewhat reveals her lack of experience; but her charming look in several beautiful dresses compensate this. I also liked the costumes. Picturing was OK despite the focusing seemed odd to me in some scenes.Cem Yilmaz displays a good performance and I believe that the film would be unbearable without him. But it is impossible to praise his achievement as a writer. The scenario have not fulfilled my expectations from Yilmaz, who could have definitely done a better job. I don't think that the film is more than mediocre, so my vote is a solid five over ten.",N/A

508,Ratatouille,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1676400/,"Ratatouille is a major step up from a lot of last year's animated fare, and a vast improvement from last year's Oscar winner for best animated feature. Here we re-discover sweet simplicity amped up with the expected story-telling techniques of Pixar, and here's the kicker, no heavy handed messages hammered in with a drill, but there certainly is a message and it's delivered with subtler grace despite some flaws. Although, aspects to the message are borderline confusing if you over analyze the reality that occurs in the film, but the film doesn't scream for over-analyzation in the same fashion as ""Finding Nemo"". For me, the animation slightly overpowers the story, and that's not necessarily a bad thing. The film is directed, camera-wise, with the same interesting techniques as ""Happy Feet"", but the film has more in store. We get to see the world mainly from Remmy's perspective, and it's visually exciting. The camera-work is what makes the film's physical humor work so well. More on the artistic scheme, the film looks really great. Particularly the lighting stands out. The colors are very lush and detailed; very accurate toward a real city-scape. Then the rat's fur are very impressive, it moves against the wind and gets wet very much like real rat hair. Don't let the detail in the clothes get past you either. The film manages to find a balance between superficial realism and animated characters. The character designs for the humans are marvelous (Bird seems to get much humor out of the smaller villains as seen in the past ""Incredibles"" and the non-Pixar film ""Shrek"") and the rats, while moving a lot like real rats still have acceptable personalities and animated form. So we feel like we're entering an animated world that is fleshy and real. Speaking of such, other animated marvels are the organic forms of the food. As real as the food in the film is, the film rightfully capture the spirit of the plot it pursues. It introduces the viewer into the world of fine-dinning and develops something rare in today's animation, a bleeding heart.Story-wise, that's the only area where I can detect any trace of criticism. I felt at times, dare I say it, that the emotion was a little bit forced. There were just certain times I didn't understand a certain character's frustration. Also, I felt uneasy about the films unusual balance of fantasy and realistic themes, such as how the reactions to rats were carried our toward the end of the film and how it blends into the films major theme and other suspend disbelief occurrences. That lack of coherent continuity gives a writer a lot more flexibility in how to tell the story. In other words, it's kind of a shortcut. But it's an observation that is made up for by other successes in the film. The film very impressively for an animated film delivers some conventional themes with a little more depth (to truly enjoy it, I'd recommend erasing the fact that rats often carry disease from your mind). It's cute without embarrassingly forcing it and unpretentious. The very fact that what makes it work may fly over the heads of small children isn't a reason to condemn it. It's true though that I feel that younger kids may get a little restless halfway though, and not just through my own experience at the theater. however, this is another great film for an older audience to enjoy a simple well told story. As for whether it will have that lasting effect that Pixar films usually carry, only time will tell.",Ratatouille
509,Ratatouille,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4446684/,"That's what the food critic, Anton Ego, says in his review of the movie's restaurant at the end of the movie. That is a good way to sum up Ratatouille.This movie released a few days after my 9th birthday. My Grandma got the DVD and I loved it. I was a kid and animated movies were my jam! I even taped a Disney Channel showing on a record-able VHS. I have seen this numerous times, and I still love it. I just saw it again as a 20 year old and it still puts me in awe.The movie is about Remy, a rat who has an obsession with food, cooking, and the humans who cook food. He meets a chef who can't cook very well, and he uses his talent to secretly help him. But that causes issues with a secret rat in a failing restaurant.I can't think of a single flaw with this movie.The animation is beautiful(I noticed one car that almost looked real at one point)and the story is well told.I know when I love a movie when I feel this thrill in my heart and an excitement along with it.(See my review of Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King) I felt that all throughout this movie, even though I have seen this movie numerous times.This is an animated movie where you don't need to be a kid to enjoy it. (Roger Ebert said this as well.) Anton Ego also says that he will return to the restaurant ""hungry for more.""

510,Casino Royale,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1519814/,"Though it doesn't care too much about the series' continuity (it's supposed to be Bond's first mission as a 00 agent, but it takes place after the Cold war and Judi Dench is already M), ""Casino Royale"" is a great re-creation of the series. Cool action, great thrills and a more humane Bond more than make up for the purported lack of gadgets. Daniel Craig plays Bond as a rough secret who only gradually acquires the class and cold demeanor we all know and love. He makes mistakes in the course of his mission, but that makes him even more of a hero. Although I found it hard at first to cope with Craig's looks, he is more than suitable as the character. Bond is portrayed as a man with flaws and weaknesses, which makes him look even stronger. The story is not your usual Bond plot and relies more on classical thrills than technology, though the action is extremely hard-boiled. Kudos to the creepy Mads Mikkelsen as Le Chiffre and Eva Green as Vesper Lynd for creating remarkably believable characters. A definite must-see for Bond fans : it should reconcile at last Ian Fleming aficionados and fans of the film series !",Casino Royale
511,Kill Bill: Vol. 2,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0931398/,"In my brief, initial review of 'Kill Bill Vol. 1.' I made the regrettable mistake of dismissing it as exceedingly pleasing yet unsubstantial stylistic masturbation, lacking the profundity and characterizations of Tarantino's previous works. Rarely have I been happier to be proven wrong.What once seemed like somewhat incoherent cinematic recklessness has, after viewing the second part of Mr. Tarantino's saga, revealed itself to be wild, imaginative and brilliant filmmaking. As a whole, 'Kill Bill' is utterly unified (not despite but because of the radical shift in tone), possesses a strong, dramatic ark, and, above all, stands as quite possibly the most passionate, loving tribute to cinema I have ever seen. While part one pays homage to Brian De Palma, Dario Argento and the Shaw Brothers, part two cites, among many others, Jean-Luc Godard, Sergio Leone, and Robert Siodmark.But that's far from all.In his critical essay 'The Cinema of the Cool', Kevin Murphy suggests that Tarantino must move on and grow up to fully realize his potential as a filmmaker. In my opinion, with this piece, he has done so. Those merely seeking the blood-splattered, broken-bone action of Vol. 1 will be severely disappointed by Vol. 2, which is infinitely more thoughtful, pondering the nature of violence, both in cause and effect. While the action in the first installment was great, comic book fun, here it becomes severely unpleasant, cringe inducing, and never without consequence. If anything, it reminded me of the great Akira Kurosawa's work. Remarkable.",Kill Bill
512,"Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter... and Spring",https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0929786/,"My review after seeing it a second time follows this first one (WARNING: SECOND REVIEW HAS SPOILERS)This beautiful film is one to see more than once -- either in the theater (or in your mind's eye). I found the discussion group on this film (see IMDb's Message Board for this film title) VERY helpful in illuminating the symbolism which I partially grasped the first time I saw it and in decoding some Buddhist principles.The setting and the photography that captures it are strikingly beautiful and satisfying. The issues are so universally human that the Buddhist flavor provides an accent and not a barrier.The story recounts the growth of a child into his adulthood and his eventual reclaiming of his roots and meaning. While the film deals with other Buddhist principles and symbolic elements, a central part of it very much reminds me of lines from T.S. Eliot's ""Four Quartets"" which reads (loosely remembered) '...and the aim of all our wandering is to arrive again at the place from which we started ---- and know it for the first time...'As one sees one cycle end and another begin, it made me wonder about how the old monk first got there and what his life was like.Symbolic. Complex. Elegantly simple. Beautiful. Evocative. Haunting. Provocative. Gently touching the universal religious and the profound.10/10 =============(SPOILERS AHEAD) After 2nd time (03Mar2011):Buddhists are against hurting animals. SO why wouldn't a wise monk intervene when the young boy in his care was tying stones to the animals? --BEFORE they died? And be aware that teenagers have hormones that often steer them? The recurring gratuitous punitiveness and pain bothered me: the monk beating the young man's back, the demand to carve all night 100s of characters into the wooden deck, the self-immolation, the pulling the weight up the mountain, the nude torso in winter, etc.As if enduring pain for pain's sake helps anything but masochism or sadism?The film's photography did remain very beautiful to me on the 2nd view.6/10",N/A
513,"Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter... and Spring",https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0963726/,"Perfect SimplicityMy review of this film should end with those two words. However, the 10 line minimum requirement that IMDb requires of all reviews belies the differences between my world and the world shown to me in Spring, Summer, Fall, Winterand Spring. I understand why IMDb does not want 1000's of (apparently) useless two-word reviews in their database. However, I would hope that they could make an exception for this film.Perfect: The film is as close to perfect as a film could get. No shot is presented to us, nor a line of dialog uttered that does not make us ponder and understand at the same time. The film is also beautiful. (Like the previous reviewer, I am a fan of Asian cinema and never tire of the stunning ability of Asian directors to capture beauty on film.) This film exceeds most other Asian films I have seen in the cinematography regard. However, its beauty is surprisingly deceptive. Like most great films, it surpasses the 'cinematography' level of beauty and delves into the beauty of existence through its story. For example, the Old Monk has a different pet during each 'season' of his life. This is not discussed by the characters nor shoved in our face by the director  as would have been done if Hollywood had done this film. It is merely background we experience and come to understand. Two days after viewing the film, I am still finding new reflections in my mind that encompass the cinematography, the literal story and the underlying context of the film.Simplicity: This film approaches a level of cinematic Haiku. While I don't recall the entire dialog with any specificity, I am sure you could print the script on one page of paper. The amazing part is that while you are watching the film, you don't notice this. Every shot moves the story along. The simplicity of life as shown by the story is reflected in the simplicity of the film. After the film ended, I had a strong urge to move away from civilization and live  or die  in peace with nature. I enjoy (and have come to be too dependent upon) modern inventions, so I will stay at home. However, this film will remain in my heart. It does exactly what good story-telling is supposed to do: Take us completely out of our world and put us in another. There is no wonder that this film was selected for so many film festivals.","Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter...and Spring"
514,The Sea Inside,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1021266/,"THE SEA INSIDE a film by Alejandro Amenabar.Almodovar has always single handed the flag for Spanish cinema for years now, out of nowhere came Amenabar reinventing genres and injecting some new blood to the otherwise malfunctioning Spanish industry, now in a big gamble he switches from psychological terror to social drama, well the big ones would be, are audiences ready to embrace the swing and more important can he hold the flag? This is the story of Ramon Sampedro, a sailor that in his twenties was paralyzed from the neck down in an accident at the sea and his fight with the Spanish government for the right to end his life. The story has the traces of an afternoon made for TV melodrama and the only way this is going to work is through words and honest performances and they both come in spades. Mateo Gil and Amenabar co-write in a way where the audience is not meant to be lead blind to a death end but they are encouraged to make up their own minds in the process and that is a brilliant stroke, this is not a movie pro death but a movie in favour of the ultimate illusions of our time LIBERTY. There is a few laughs spare a long the way, like when the church comes home in a wheel chair to deconstruct Sampedro beliefs but is mostly a valley of tears through out, punches coming from all fronts even when you think you are safe his father that to that point didn't make any sense comes up with the most moving line of the entire movie. It is a heartbreaking experience specially when Sampedro seems more full of life than most the people wandering the streets and everyone around him tries to convince him of the wonders of life even those who are helping him to die but when you strip a man of his dreams The film is almost exclusively built on close ups bringing a claustrophobic feeling that makes the audience more sympathetic with Sampedro. That's for the actors a huge challenge that must construct their whole performances with their eyes and the eyes don't lie. Bardem was not granted his second Oscar nomination, probably in favour of Eastwood, but in my opinion he was the only one who could have shadowed Jammie Fox. This role reminds me of the great Gregory Peck in TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD where the acting looked effortless and I reckon Bardem has reached that status where the line of what is acting and what is real has become completely blur. I was never fond of his early work but since Almodovar's LIVE FLESH he is on a roll, LOS LUNES AL SOL, THE DANCER UPSTAIRS and the Oscar nominated BEFORE THE NIGHT FALLS made him an international star and although he and Banderas come from the same Almodovar background is fascinating to see how different paths they took and how Bardem has now become a real reference for Spanish cinema in the whole world. A golden globe, 14 Goyas, jury prize at Venice and probably an Oscar with permission from THE CHORUS BOYS, Amenabar directs, co-write, edits and puts music to a high caliber drama, he has pull it off what about some Science Fiction now? Whose life is it anyway?****.",The Sea Inside
515,The Sea Inside,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1025391/,"Many more eloquent reviews than this have described the quite spectacular acting, casting and styling of this film. It appears that the only negative reviews focus on a perceived imbalance in the film's handling of the core moral question (euthanasia).This film is, bar the final scenes, meticulous in stressing Ramon's belief that he's not making some grand point but merely that, for him, a life devoid of dignity is a life not worth living. We, as viewers, see an enormous amount of dignity in his life - we see family and friends and culture and, but for its physical limitations, a life fully lived. Central to the tragedy of this film is that there is really only one person who thinks that Ramon's life is not worth living - and that is him.To watch this film and say that the only counter argument comes from the visit of a bumbling priest is a nonsense. The priest's visit is pure farce, a direct assault on the simplicity of the Spanish Catholic Church's response to the issue of euthanasia. However, the sister's parting words to the priest momentarily expose the powerful 'pro-life' sentiments quietly underpinning the entire film. We are constantly encouraged to see the hope and the beauty of a life lived with love. As the film progresses, we may gradually be encouraged to understand Ramon's reasoning but we are never reconciled to his decision. I do not remember a film which moved me and provoked me as much as this.",N/A
516,Cinderella Man,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1082650/,"Just saw a preview of this film (opens June 3) and as shamelessly emotional as it is, I liked it very much. It provides a more visceral view of the Great Depression era than did another fine film, Seabiscuit. Call it Seabiscuit with even more heart! Ron Howard teams with Russell Crowe (James J. Braddock) again and shows they can repeat with a winner. Like him as a person or not, Crowe puts forth another finely tuned, very convincing performance. Unlike in real life, he can be quite humble and sympathetic while beating the heck out of people. Really, his character is affecting, especially in his scenes with Braddock's children, and may be fairly reflective of the actual person of Braddock. (The fight game at that time, or any time, was not for saints but, whatever.) Renee Zellweger, who is not my favorite except for a brilliant portrayal in Cold Mountain, plays the wife effectively and mirrors the emotions for the females in the audience. (If my observations at the showing are typical, women fans will spend time alternately heading their eyes and virtually cheering out loud for Braddock/Crowe.) There are a number of good supporting actors but Paul Giamatti strikes again! He plays the manager who supports Braddock through thick and thin and his character recalls the era better than anyone in the film. I don't know what kind of research he did for this role but his Joe Gould is the archetypal boxing manager of the time or, at least, our cinema image of one. Here's hoping he pulled some big bucks for a role for once.(You will certainly recognize Bruce McGill, as the seemingly hard-hearted fight promoter who could care less about Braddock but really doesn't want to see him get killed in the ring, from many movie and TV appearances where he is always reliable and who may be remembered from an early exposure as ""D-Day"" in Animal House.)",N/A

518,Kal ho naa ho,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0980211/,"What can you say about this movie? The makers have ensured that they have greased the wheels properly before the turkey was served.Lets look at the few aspects of the movie::01. Story: Nothing new but well-presented. And obviously the ""Anand"" factor was a diversion. 02. Characters: All of them etched out well. Be it talented Jaya Bachchan, Sushma Seth, Lillette Dubey, Sweetu, Rajpal Yadav or the highlight Kantaben. Simone Singh was good as well - she attempts a bit of skin-show, desperately wanting to break-free from the Heena image.03. Comedy: Comedy tracks have been really worked upon. There are many pokings at Gujju's directly (the audience on both my sides appeared threatening!) - but in spite of that the G.U.J.J.U. song makes up for all the damage. Clever, very clever. Kantaben was good and so was Satish Shah (and his English). 04. Location: The movie is a proper New York Darshan bus. The trivial mistakes about jogging to Central Park from Queens can be easily overlooked in the age where the scripts have crater sized holes. 05. Music: S-E-L have given one of their best compositions to date. Be it the title song or Mahi Ve - all of them stay with you for a long time. My favourite is Its the time to disco, Vasundhara Das rocks (she bring out the voice of Nazia Hassan). 06. Lyrics: The title song is definitely Javed Akhtar caliber. For the rest he should give the credit to a pseudonym.07. Spl. Appearances: Sonali Bendre and Sanjay Kapoor have extended special appearances. And in blink-an-miss appearances by Kajol & Rani (lucky mascots of Karan Johar), Uday Chopra and Jugal Hansraj. 08. Protagonists: SRK plays his part extremely well in the author backed role as ""the good Samaritan"", however does succumb to a bit of his usual hamming. Saif proves yet again that he is a dependable actor and at times can steal the show right under the nose. His performance at the restaurant (proposing scene) is wonderful. Preity does full justice to her character (Kareena - sour grapes! sour grapes!).09. Tracks: In fact the movie is full of tracks but interesting ones. Be it Kantaben, Simone Singh, the wrong house, 7-day proposing, Sweetu, revamping of the restaurant or Gia's adoption track. The director has just done a good copy-paste of it.The makers have ensured that there is maximum utilisation of resources at all fronts. For a first-timer Nikhil Advani has done a commendable job, obviously under the baton of Karan Johar who ensured that Yash Johar films flag remains high and rising.Definitely worth a watch.... with family.PS: Its interesting to see that from time to time, SRK acknowledges Aamir Khan in his movies (here the Lagaan song and in K3G the Ghulam matchstick).",N/A

Shah Rukh Khan's brilliant performance will stay with you forever.I was up at 2.30 in the morning, tissues strewn all around me with tears just pouring down my face. The moment you try to stop crying, another scene comes on and you start again. Seriously, i'm really sensitive so no surprise but i reckon this film was the first film that actually made me cry that much. I just couldn't stop!! This is a must for everyone..including you sensitive people out there! Everyone must watch this film! It's just beautiful and it was actually an eye-opener for me! You've got to cherish whatever you have because who knows...tomorrow may never come.",N/A
520,Infernal Affairs,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1211149/,"This movie has been regarded as the cream of Hong Kong gangster and cop movie. And has won 22 awards. But we all know awards don't mean a thing sometimes. The God Father of America cinema ""Martin Scorsese"" himself is making a American version of the movie, titled: Departed. I'm somewhat happy to see that this movie is being recognized and acknowledged by a true master, but distraught to the possibility of disappointment.A little history of Hong Kong film industry, being in somewhat government free state for over 100 years, Hong Kong movie industry proliferated to the state of hysteria. On one hand, everything goes as long as people get what they want for 2 hours worth. On the other hand, lack of political drama has afforded the gangster and cop drama to truly grow and mature.Now back to the movie itself. 3 years ago, when I was still a poor student, I was loitering in the local Chinese video store as usual, looking for something exciting. The owner handed me a VHS copy of this movie, he personally recommended it and said it's new and unique. So I went home and watched it immediately. And then I said in my then dark and dingy apartment for 30 minutes, in utter silence.There was no plot twist, and no surprise ending, no Mr. M Night's heavy handed gimmicks and Hollywood's camera tricks. But from the beginning to the end, for full 2 hours, you can cut the tension with a knife. In the end, you still don't want it to end. The story goes on in your mind, questions, bits and pieces start to put together, characters start to take shape even after the movie ended.In my entire life, I've never seen a movie that there isn't a single excessive frame, until I saw this movie. It has forever changed my expectation on crime drama.The story is genius and simple enough. A mole in police department working against an undercover cop in drug trafficking mafia. They don't know each other's identity, so it is like a invisible tug war between the two competing against each other's wits. I won't reveal too much of it even though like I said, there's no plot twist.It's a fairly popular movie that has generated huge buzz when it came out, and since been talked, compared and still highly regarded as unsurpassed by countless fans worldwide. It has an all star cast in Hong Kong cinema, and of course, the screenplay, the acting, the editing, the camera work and overall directing is flawless judging by all standards.If you are adventurous enough to try even one Hong Kong movie, try this one.",Infernal Affairs
521,Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0884790/,"Although I had expectations ( from watching the trailers ) that this might be a good movie, I was still surprised that it's as good as it is. The story is actually more complex than I had expected, involving cursed pirates and their quest to rid themselves of the curse. I won't say more than that so as not to spoil it if you haven't seen it.There aren't as many action scenes as I had thought there would be in a pirate movie, but the ones that are in the movie were very fun and enjoyable. After seeing it, I think it had the right balance of action and drama. There are also, of course, a lot of funny bits interspersed between the action and drama. Some really good special effects also add to the enjoyment of this movie.I wasn't much of a fan of Johnny Depp until I saw this movie. I think he deserved to win the Academy Award for best actor. It's largely because of his performance, IMO, that the movie was so good. Most of the supporting cast did well, mind you, just that Johnny Depp stood high above the rest. I did find Orlando Bloom's performance a bit wooden, but other than that the acting was good.Basically, it's a really fun movie and I'd give it about 8 out of 10",Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl
522,Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1226155/,"I am nearly fifty years old. A sober grown man. With children. Children with whom I have now sat through hundreds of movies. Many of which I have enjoyed. And I am not completely hardened in my sophistication. The opening music to The Lion King brought tears to my eyes when my little ones were but wee tots. But still, these are after all just children's movies. In another life, I would never have seen them. And, really, one can't take such movies too seriously, can one?And so, this summer, after the ritual badgering, I dutifully trudged into yet another Disney ""adventure"" movie. Named after that tired old ride in Anaheim I first went on in 1965. I mean really, how much can you expect?And then, it happened. The swirling intoxication. The stunned feeling. What? Who? How? Was this a movie? Or a religious experience? Perhaps more like an addictive experience...I cannot remember ever willingly paying to see any movie not starring a relative of mine more than twice, and I can count those movies on one hand. I have now seen ""Pirates"" four times. The only thing keeping me from seeing it again is the sense that this whole thing is just getting out of hand. I cannot get enough of it. It's like walking into a painting that you never want to come back out of. My children ask, with a note of concern in their voices, ""Dad, you really like Pirates of the Caribbean a lot, don't you?""And that Depp fellow. My God. I never had any idea who he was, but his name sounded like something created for a pubescent cover-boy for magazines published to hook thirteen year-old girls on make-up and bad music. Wasn't Depp the name of some hair-goo product back in the 60s?I am a straight male. I have several good friends who are gay, but have never fantasized about any gender but the female. But now I understand how women can experience swooning crushes on male film stars. He is simply extraordinary. So sly, so seductive, so canny! I read an interview in which Depp said he went through a slight depression when he had to stop playing Captain Jack Sparrow. I can see why. His inventiveness and sheer pleasure in inhabiting the character come through in every frame. How can I admit to my children that I now troll through fan websites about a former teen heart-throb?I often don't even watch the Academy Awards, and I certainly never have any emotional investment in who wins.Except for this year.Go Jack.And, in a time when many big-budget movies are little more than a hodge-podge of loosely- connected ""money shots"" this movie puts all the pieces together, with a sense of fun and light-heartedness in special effects that are simply dazzling. I find myself laughing with dizzy appreciation when Barbossa barks out, ""You'd best be believing in ghost stories, Miss Turner, you're in one!"" and the grinning skeletons come into view, with Badelt's pounding score keeping time to the beat of their maniacal deck-swabbing. And then there's the scene of the pirate-ghouls slithering up from the darkened sea on the mooring cables of the Dauntless, like infernal cats stalking their prey.And now to the music. I can just hear the effete aesthetes dismissing this score, as Mr. Zimmerman anticipates with his winking ""overproduced by"" credit on the cover-liner. ""Bombastic."" ""Overdone."" ""Absurdly Stupendous.""Well, perhaps it is, for those who spend their lives evaluating such things. To me, it is absolutely transporting. I first listened to it while doing a work-out on a rowing machine and found that I tripled my usual distance. It was like mainlining some hazardous tachycardic amphetamine.Once again, the children were wondering, ""What's up with Daddy? Is he OK?""Perhaps I am just losing my grip, having an adolescent movie get to me this way. But when those final credits roll, and Captain Jack narrows his eyes and says, ""Now, bring me that horizon. Drink up me hearties, yo ho"" and the music swells ... it is difficult to put into words the effect it has.At this point my children have to yank me forcibly from the theater, lest I persist in watching the credits to the bitter end, and bid good-bye to the little monkey once more, wiping tears of exultation from my eyes.This is not just another ""entry"" in the summer blockbust sweepstakes. It is an exquisite work of fantasy and inventiveness, a true classic, on the order of ""The Wizard of Oz."" I do hope Depp's performance garners not just awards, but a place in the pantheon, something we old fogies -- and our gently fogeying children decades hence -- will show to our children and grandchildren like a revealed treasure. I cannot recall any movie having such an effect on me.",Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl
523,Big Fish,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0874784/,"What do you say about this movie?I am at a total loss to describe it.  The concept itself, a son tries to come to terms with his dying father that he knows nothing about but an enormous catalog of unbelievable stories, doesn't sound very promising.  It sounds like a tired old formula, and I expected such when the rental started playingIt's not.Werewolves, giants, witches, siamese twins, bank robbers, hidden cities, sirens, etc. are all present in the fantasy, but they seem unremarkably to be part of the life of an otherwise ordinary traveling salesman.  Whether they really are or not is never made completely clear, but that's the rub.I once read a review by Harlan Ellison in which the main point was how a well told lie illuminates the truth in far better clarity than a simple recitation of the facts ever can.  At one point in the film, the questing son remarks to his bed-ridden father that he's heard all of his stories thousands of times, and he has know idea who his father really is.  The father's reply is, `I've never been anybody but me from the day I was born. If you don't know who I am, that's your failing, not mine.'  Later investigations make the point clearer.  I'll bet Ellison loved this movie. It is an extraordinary lie.Did I like the film?  You bet.  It's Tim Burton's best work without a doubt. Is it for everybody?  Probably not.  Many will find it confusing and pointless, but good fantasy is like that.  All I can say is, relax and let it happen.  You won't regret it.",Big Fish
524,My Sassy Girl,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0830111/,"The attention to detail, the depth and width of the plot is amazing.  The movie is so good that it provide good entertainment to many audience.I cannot grasp all of it till I saw it the second time.  There are several plots in the movie.  I am learning more about the movie when I am writing this.It's NOT only a love story of how 2 people with contrasting personality fall in love; it may give that impression to some people.  It's NOT a normal dumb boy chase beautiful girl flick.STOP READING and see the movie again if you really think this movie is just a romantic flick with funny jokes.  You will enjoy it more.SUPER SPOILER ---------------------The Character: The girl always think she is special (she say that explicitly when she is crying at the hillside), and which beautiful girl doesn't? Or at least everyone else wish to?   She is very self-centered, proud, witty (remember how quick she get Gyun-Woo out of class?), talented (kendo, piano, squash, dance), not afraid of how people look at her, live in a quite well off family etc.The director has to stress that Gyun-Woo is smart (from their parents) because viewer may not really notice that if they don't really observe.  He is a sensitive person, probably due to his girlish upbringing.Gyun-Woo is quite layback, and yet to determine what he desire or want in life in the beginning.  And that's one of the reason the girl said, 'I have met the boy from the future' at the ending.  For the first 3 years they meet, they are not really ready for each other, due her ex-boyfriend (exbf) and personality.  They are at the crossroad, so they eventually have to split.The Story: In the subway, Gyun-Woo gets the girl's attention immediately since he looks like her ex-boyfriend.  She may actually intentionally grasp his attention by vomiting etc.  Then she announces to the public right away that he is her 'Sweet heart', so he have no option but to take care of her.  As a proof of Gyun-Woo getting her attention is that, she scold at the youngster who wears pink.  She thinks he is special and no one else should wear the same color for the one she thinks special.  This point can verified again in the park which the guy who smokes and wear the same blue-colored sweater. She knows she is beautiful and clothing matter a lot for her or those she cares.It is quite deceiving that most viewer will initially think that only Gyun-Woo is attracted by the girl and a normal boy chase girl story starts. But it's not.  They both are attracted to each other at their first sight.To call Gyun-Woo 'sweet heart' may come from her subconscious.  It is so important to her to understand herself that she need to confirm with Gyun-Woo that she indeed think Gyun-Woo has so much resemblance with her exbf.  So she phoned Gyun-Woo to come out for the 1st time.  (Phone number probably obtained during their stay at the police station)After Gyun-Woo left the girl on a bench, he forget the girl's handbag and he have to return it a few steps later.   Later, he forget her handbag again in the rain. This time leads him to visit the girl's home for the first time. We can see that every detail is well layout, intentional in this movie.First time I see the movie, I was distracted by my laughing, but now I know the reason why police rush up to the motel.  The phone call is made by the girl's parent.  That's one of the reasons why her parents' are not approved of him.  And they know it's all lie when he try explaining why the motel's lighter is in his pocket.(Is there any meaning for the kids to all suddenly gone when they are in the coffees shop?  And why does the coffee come so late?) (Why does the girl slap Gyun-Woo so often? Is there any meaning behind?)The Girl always tries to be different.  She doesn't like people dress alike; she doesn't like those people ordering the same golbangee (beef stew) in the restaurant.Why are they using the same motel room the second night? On the first night the innkeeper says there no room left from 1st to 3rd floor, so on the second night the same thing happened coincidentally; all other rooms are occupied.Do your recognize in her first script Gyun-Woo asks why don't they kiss at the end?  He is actually talking about why they do not kiss in this movie. Then the girl (director) says that this script (movie) is not a melodrama. (Then, how come this movie is a action movie?)Also, the first script prophesize the girl saving Gyun-Woo in the playground later.For the second script, I will talk about that later.The reason why she pushes Gyun-Woo into the water is she wants Gyun-Woo in the water too. She wants Gyun-Woo in some way connected to her exbf too. Her exbf drowned, implied when the girl staring at a pier with the ex-bf's mother later.  Assuming that she don't know whether Gyun-Woo can swim or not, the girl is confident that she can rescue him OR she hope this boy will not just leave her, by a simple drowning accident.  The story did not tell how her ex-bf drowned, whether the girl is present or not.  But if the girl was at the scene at the accident, that means she have learnt lifegaurding after he died (which I biasedly assume).  Nevertheless, the girl found peace of mind/satisfaction that she knows if she is together with any boy, the boy will not be drowned.  She wants to try and confirm that with this boy.In the playground's 'Ghost House', the girl say the pain one suffered from being dumped will be gone quicker than one can imagine.  But it looks like it is contrary to her own behavior.  So, why she said that?  Actually the girl is not just grieving for the death of her exbf at this stage. She is also guilty, angry with herself on not loving her ex-bf as much any more. Or at least, she is struggling with try keep loving him or kicks him out of her mind/present life.  Rationally, she knows this is the thing to do, to face it, to leave away from the ghost of his exbf.  However, she is not as 'special' as she would like, that she still long for him, since she is attracted to Gyun-Woo the first time they met.The soldier claimed the guardhouse sergeant looks like Gyun-Woo.  Who else look like Gyun-Woo?  He should be the ex-bf.  The director maybe even hinting that he is not that good to the Girl, although the girl never know this.  Well, I may be stretching that a bit here, but considered so many detail in this movie have an explanation, I won't be surprised if this is what the director meant.When the girl is saving Gyun-Woo under gunpoint, she cried.  She is actually talking to herself this time.  She think that her dead ex-bf want her to live well.  She says if she needs to learn what love is, she need to live well.  To live well, love is essential, but this is what a dead man cannot give her.  This is her struggle.At the end of the playground scene Gyun-Woo say what had happened is as if what he have planned.  He intends to understand the girl better at her birthday. At this stage all he know is the girl is devastated from a breakup, but not much else. Under such a stressful circumstances, the answer she give on how she view about her pain, view of good life/love must be authentic.  It's something hard to achieve by a normal date on this girl. Although the means is not what he expected, the ends is.    And the last slap on his face is always good.  It means she cares.Part 2 *****Gyun-Woo noticed somehow notice the girl in the restaurant.  Then Gyun-Woo goes back alone and asks around about this picture because Gyun-Woo will not ask that when the girl is around. Gyun-Woo want to understand her pain, try solving it.  The girl bring Gyun-Woo there a lot.  By now, Gyun-Woo is really a replacement for his exbf, and he knows. He tries to be nice and smile.  And Gyun-Woo said that she pretends to be happy every time (in this restaurant), because he knows she has lots of memory/history with her exbf in this restaurant.  And she comes back with him often.Not too sure why the bad guy in the 3rd script is called Gyun-Woo, and why she have to kill him?  If the director really meant the bad guy = her exbf (because they are look-alike and the director don't want to give a name to her exbf), it means the girl try forget him.  And interestingly the girl comes from future, so the director may think she can only forget him some time in future?After the script, she says 'Someday, I'll meet someone from the future'. Actually, it means 'Today, she meet someone (important to her= Gyun-Woo) that will be suitable for her in the future'.   Then Gyun-Woo says, 'if you do, ask him to take you; if it's possible!'  Gyun-Woo is urging her to let himself to take her!   Gyun-Woo looks very serious at this moment.  This is not a joke of 'You, sassy girl, let someone come from a UFO/future kidnap you!'After the 3rd script, they always ride subway together, play squash, phone each other every night, and wait for Gyun-Woo at school etc.  The girl really starts to love him, ever since Gyun-Woo chase her on high heel.  The longer he runs, the longer she loves him.  She remains jubilant that night. Even in the rain,  she is even nice enough to him, to run back home for an umbrella.  Each day, she likes Gyun-Woo more and more.Their parent controls her too much. (Party) because she love them too, she refrain herself from seeing Gyun-Woo/have to dealt directly with her parents about this.  So, Gyun-Woo doesn't have any news from her for a long time until their 100th day when their parent give her pressure.In the taxi, Gyun-Woo wonders if she still needs him as her exbf's replacement.  He tries to heal her pain, but he thinks the irony is that once the pain is gone, she no longer needs him.  He is well aware that the 'action'/'power' is always initiated from her.  But just for this moment, it does not matter; he enjoys every moment with her.  He ask the taxi driver to let them stay together longer.Maybe what Gyun-Woo think is correct, she doesn't need him anymore. That's why once her parent again pressured her this time; they don't meet each other for such a long time that Gyun-Woo think they are over.  So it's not too surprising for Gyun-Woo to go to a blind date.The condom and blind date joke is really funny, though gross.This time, the girl has a blind date.  She definitely is not the one who arrange it, her controlling parents do.  She call Gyun-Woo for help, Gyun-Woo is her 'friend'.  She has to call and give Gyun-Woo a chance here, since this time her blind date is quite nice.Ah... the 10 rules are very moving.  Gyun-Woo must be very sad when he left the restaurant.  He gives up on her.  He is giving his final blessing to them.The girl finally realizes that she did not recognize how deep he loves her. He deserve much more than a replacement or 'friend'. Everything she did want Gyun-Woo do for her is simply the way she try to find her exbf in Gyun-Woo. Gyun-Woo is not necessary Gyun-Woo in her mind at those important moments. She thought she just enjoy reliving it.  But after the 10 rules, she can no longer deny Gyun-Woo is the one who makes her happy, not the ghosts of her exbf.Before they try kissing, Gyun-Woo said they are on a crossroad since she had always regarded Gyun-Woo as painkiller.  But now she knows that she feel guilty for him and it's time for her to take action, to accept Gyun-Woo as 'another' important person in her life.  Gyun-Woo has already done all he can at this stage.But for the Girl to look at Gyun-Woo is painful.  He reminds her of his ex-bf, every time.  They look and seem to act alike.  She has to completely remove her ex-bf (first love, I believe)'s image before she can really love Gyun-Woo.  But she feels guilty to try removing her exbf from her mind, at the same time.When Gyun-Woo is writing the letter, saying he want to be serious with her. But even though he doesn't know exactly what she's thinking, he is sensitive enough to think this letter is for their split up.At the mountain, she express that her ex-bf is still very well within her. She hopes she is different, she hope she have the will to overcome, but no, she is still helpless.  She cannot avoid thinking of her ex-bf when seeing Gyun-Woo.  She is sorry, for that.They have to split; Gyun-Woo's presence is too disturbing for her to forget. She gives herself 2 years.  She goes away for Gyun-Woo.  Gyun-Woo tries to grow up and his life in these 2 years just devoted to her; he even tried and succeeds fulfilling her dream. No more blind dates, he is committed.The way they pile up the stones (and how Gyun-Woo remove it), one-by-one instead of bushing them away is quite a display sensitivenessOvertime ***** It's quite too late to explain clearly the drowning of her exbf now.  It makes lots of audience miss why her grievance is so deep.  And may not understand some finer points of the movie.Now we know why the girl ask about the handkerchief when Gyun-Woo is with the girl was crying at the 2nd restaurant.  A handkerchief has a very special meaning for her.  This was how her exbf meet her.She says 'While I was dating you, I met his mother OFTEN, she wanted to introduce a nice men to me, BUT I couldn't' Simply means she is still love her exbf very much at that time.  Also, it's quite funny that she thinks her exbf wants to introduce Gyun-Woo to her, when Gyun-Woo is hanging out with her.She wants to put this letter into a time capsule because it is too cruel so tell Gyun-Woo all this right away.  And she does believe she will overcome her mental barrier in 2 year.  However she cannot. It takes her 3 years.What the old man says to her is important; he makes her know that Gyun-Woo is still very much in love with her.  Time means nothing to him, just for her (NB. This is what the theme song about)The girl called Gyun-Woo's phone but the number has been changed.  She cried. Wondered if they ever met again, when she is ready for him now, after 3 years.  Not too sure if they'd ever meet by chance again.  Then she smiled.  But why she smiles?  Maybe she has just remembered how Gyun-Woo pretended the voice message long time ago?  Or have her just lost hope and grin bitterly?  The tiny touches let audience imagines, and could as well be the ending at this point.Can they meet by chance?  Very often fate only give you 1 chance.  Once you lose it, you lose it.  Gyun-Woo must be very upset when he misses her this time in the subway.Maybe due to coincidence, they finally met each other at her exbf's mom's lunch.Then she said, 'I think I met a man from the future, from your (Gyun-Woo)'s future.'  Do you recall all 1st and 3d script tells a story of girl coming from future helps Gyun-Woo or everyone else?  But this time, she meant instead of the girl coming from future, it is the boy coming from future that saves her.The best part of the movie is that it can be viewed from many angles.  Many subplots.. ---------------------------------------The Platform plot: ------------------ After the 10 rules, Gyun-Woo stands on the verge of subway platform (as seen on the surveillance camera). Is he trying to feel her pain of the breakup that she experienced with her exbf when she stood there? Was she really trying to kill herself at that time?  He wants to understand this feeling. Or simply just want to remember how they first met.  Then, He must be really happily running when he hear her voice form the broadcast.At the end of movie, when she stands on the platform edge again, we only saw her feet.  But what's really on her mind?  Is she expecting Gyun-Woo will pull her back again this time?  Now they have lost contact, will coincidence let them meet again?  Or is she simply enjoying the thought of how they first meet?  Nevertheless the subway come, she has to reluctantly drag her feet back, behind the yellow line.The edge of the platform is a crossroad of their fate.  This is the place she is going to suicide, where they met, where they miss each other, where travel together and getting to like each other etc.The Science Fiction Plot: ------------------ At the girl's third script, she mentioned explicitly the science fiction Plot of this movie, UFO = time machine.  Then she prophesize Gyun-Woo will like to travel back in time, the old-aged Gyun-Woo.  She said 'people from the future could be here now'Why don't they travel together?  Did the girl left Gyun-Woo/died before the invention of time machine?  Well, this is a story not being told. However, it is hinted that it's quite likely that the girl go back and make fun of him with the toad in the time capsule.  How about the head hitting squash? Another naughty joke from future?In her letter in the time capsule, she feels that Gyun-Woo 'live in the future' and she 'live in the past'From the look of the old man under the tree, do you think he is expecting her to visit the tree?  Don't you think it's quite rude for him to stare at her?  Yet the old man's answer is honest enough, because she is beautiful. The old man always says that because he is the old Gyun-Woo.  And of course he read the letters.What is his secret of the tree? Gyun-Woo cannot really replace a tree.  But with the help of the old Gyun-Woo, he can. This is a secret because the old Gyun-Woo only wants to share this between him and her! No one else! He say 'Fate is building a bridge of chance for someone you love' because he is help building this bridge for themselves.When she lookup after reading Gyun-Woo's letter, a UFO passes by; even with sound effect.The old Gyun-Woo was there inside the train when they met.At the end, she said 'I think I met a man from the future, from your (Gyun-Woo)'s future'.  This is literally what has happened.The Girl's second script ------------------ For the 2nd time I see this movie, I cannot fully grasp this script.  But now I can. Actually the girl is committing suicide when they first met.  She know she get drunk easily, it easier to do it that way.  She wants to die at the 1st year anniversary of her exbf's death.  This is why in her 2nd script the 'unlucky' boy should be buried alive, which simply meant lovers should better die together.  Do you think that the girl looks more like a ghost than a drunken woman at the platform?  It's quite a drastic look for lead actress in movie that supposed to be a comedy (at least at the beginning). The vomit after that is very good. It makes the audience forget her awful look, or forget to wonder if she is commiting suicide.  But isn't that quite crazy for anyone to vomit onto someone.  We all know that she is drunk but is still quite aware of her action.  But naturally, she doesn't really care since she planned to kill herself anyway!  The girl is not as sassy as most people perceived.  But she's pretty unruly anyway.When dating with Gyun-Woo, she always has to struggle with her guilt to her exbf, since her exbf have done nothing wrong to her.  He have no choice, he have to leave her.  For her, to accept a person that is in many ways resembles her exbf as another individual, is a especially difficult task. Her life can be much easier if she choose that nice guy at her blind date (or any other guy); but she knows Gyun Woo is her right choice however difficult this choice is.The Theme of the story is: Fate vs. Coincidence ------------------ Tons of coincidence happened here: Gyun-Woo is a look-alike, know the exbf's mother, is that coincidence? How coincidence is that the one girl you pick randomly on the street is the Girl? The birthday of the Girl and the soldier is the same; Blind date at the same night; the handkerchief, which is the first favor of both her ex-bf and Gyun-Woo give, is greenish; they both first met in subway; they have meet all of the 5 twins, without them recognizing....At the end of movie, Gyun-Woo asked, 'Is that coincidence?'  This is the question the director is asking the audience what is fate and what is pure coincidence.  Director's view of Fate is it happens only when one build/desire of it.  He demonstrate that by putting lots of coincidence in the movie, while let both characters work hard for/build up their good ending, which many people will regard that as fate.
Examples of building chances: The old Gyun-Woo is help building his own fate under the tree by voicing the young Gyun-Woo's effort.  And during the 3 years separation they are building a bridge for each other on their own, by making themselves available for each other.  If the girl still cannot get out of her exbf's entangle, there is no point of meeting again.  And now Gyn-Woo seems to find a direction of his life on writing script.Lastly, have her exbf also bridge a bridge for the one he loved?

525,Dogville,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0956746/,"I started watching Dogsville and felt like turning it off.. after all, what kind of movie could occur with no scenery? No doors.. it seemed like some sort of play/movie hybrid but after a shortwhile all those things faded away until I realized how much I would have missed if I had turned it off - it is now one of my favourite movies of all time.Why? It is so brave to criticse humanity like this and admit just how 'dark' a race we truly are - not matter how much each of us profess to being 'good', we all know that most of us are anything but. Through this movie you see a woman who learns the cold harsh truth in a place where she expected to find the goodness that her faith told her existed. And then on not finding it, discovered that even within her lay a wrath that echoed the darkness that she herself wished did not feature so dominant in our race. And the biggest test of this is to observe your own emotions throughout this movie until what you feel at the end as perfect evidence...I honestly believe those people that don't believe what this movie is expressing needs to take a cold hard look around them. And if they still don't believe, they are just like the people in this movie - unwilling to see the truth and coming up with excuses and reasons when nothing justifies the horrible world we live in.A true masterpiece - one of the few pure pieces of art in cinema with amazing acting from Nicole Kidman especially, and the lack of a set causes you to be immersed in the characters like no other movie. And its 'them' and human nature that is the focus. Will leave you thinking and astounded (unless you don't like to think and can't watch a movie that isn't afraid to do something unique, in which case there a countless movies for 'you').",N/A

From the first time i realized that this movie is a masterpiece. A real comedy, a real drama. No fake reality, no fake emotions. Everything flows in a perfect harmony. The music, the picture, the characters... Every character in this movie is so unique that you have the feeling that you have met him. You don't have to know Turkish to understand the movie, characters speak with their expressions. Music, life style and the beautiful wild nature fits so perfect together.This movie, is a true gem.

It just does too poorly of a job explaining its plot and instead of feeling satisfied, I felt confused and almost irritated to the point of losing almost all interest inte the film. I watched the director's cut that, at a 25 minutes longer run-time, still didn't have enough time to show the piece of exposition needed to understand what the hell was going on.Unpopular opinion maybe, but apart from some cool bits, ""Donnie Darko"" seriously let me down.",Donnie Darko

I was moved on many levels and felt almost every conceivable emotion at one point or another.  The characters seemed so real to me that I was hard pressed to think of a movie that had the same strong level of character development across the board.  The only negative comment I can make is that I felt like there were a couple loose ends when the movie finished.  But this may have been intentional and was a minor blemish in an otherwise very fine film.  Even Tom Cruise reached new levels as an actor in this film.

532,The Straight Story,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1352714/,"This is one of the greatest films I have ever seen: I glowed inside throughout the whole film. The music and cinematography held the spell when little was happening on screen. The slow pace was set by the mode of travel (a riding lawn mower with a big trailer) and was maintained by the background sights and sounds and the slow-paced lives of the other characters.The story actually happened; Alvin Straight died in 1996 at the age of 76. There was no acting; everything was completely real, as if the actors had actually transformed into the characters. Sissy Spacek gave a poignant performance as a somewhat disabled daughter who had suffered much but forged ahead, always wanting to do the right thing. Richard Farnsworth was cast perfectly and he beautifully became Alvin Straight, a stubborn but loving elderly man who treks across Iowa to visit his estranged brother, Lyle, who has had a stroke. Alvin had learned much wisdom during his life and that seemed to bring out the best in the people that he encountered along the way.The film underscores the importance of family to this man and, hopefully, to all of us. I eagerly anticipate seeing it again, and again. Directed by David Lynch, this films proves his directorial skill. Farnsworth was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Actor; at 79, he was the oldest nominee ever for that award.",The Straight Story
533,The Straight Story,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0967782/,"Perhaps more than many films, this one is not for everyone. For some folks the idea of slowing down, reflecting and allowing things to happen in their own time is a good description of their personal hell. For others an approach like this speaks to some deep part of themselves they know exists, some part they long for contact with.I suppose it's a function of where I am in my own life these days, but I count myself in the camp of the latter group. I found the meditative pace of this film almost hypnotic, gently guiding me into some realm almost mythological. This is indeed a journey story, a rich portrayal of the distance many of us must travel if we are to come full circle at the end of our days.Much as been written of Mr Farnsworth's presentation of Alvin Straight, though I'm not sure there are words to express the exquisite balance of bemused sadness and wise innocence he conjured for us. Knowing now that he was indeed coming to terms with his own mortality as he sat on that tractor seat makes me wish I had had the opportunity to spend time with him before his departure. I hope he had a small glimmer of the satisfaction and truth he had brought to so many people, not just for ""acting"" but for sharing his absolute humanity with such brutal honesty.Given the realities of production economics, I'm not sure full credit has been given Mr Lynch for the courage he showed in allowing the story to develop so slowly. An outsider to film production, I nonetheless understand there are few areas of modern life where the expression ""time is money"" is so accurately descriptive. Going deep into our hearts is not an adventure that can be rushed, and to his credit Mr Lynch seems to have understood that he was not simply telling a story--he was inviting his viewers to spend some time with their own mortality. No simple task, that.If you'd like to experience the power of film to take introduce you to some precious part of yourself, you could do worse than spending a couple of hours with The Straight Story. And then giving yourself some time for the next little while simply listening to its echoes in the small hours of the night.",The Straight Story
534,Perfect Blue,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0554958/,"On the cover of this film, Roger Corman is quoted as saying ""If Alfred Hitchcock partnered with Walt Disney they'd make a picture like this."" He couldn't be more right.The story is about a pop idol Mima, who is sheding her squeaky-clean image for that of an actress. Along the way, she is raped onscreen for a sleazy television show, and does a nude shoot for a men's magazine. This makes her dirty, as her old self tells her. She finds a web site detailing every intimate little detail in her life, and believes that she is being stalked by a strange man. Her personality splits in two, into herself and her old, clean, self which tries to murder her. While she is battling her old self, all of those who contributed to her downfall are being grusomely murdered.
This movie has been critisized by others on this very site, saying that the film was boring in the first 40 minutes. How wrong they are. In Hitchcock's films, (take Psycho for example) he builds up character for the first half-hour until the slashing. This does the same, because if we were not built up to believe that Mima's character is not real-i.e 3-dimensional, then we would feel no sense of loss and disorientation when all hell breaks loose in Mima's life (and the editing room).A first class film with twists all the way. Should be seen by any movie fan with a mature mind. Even though it will probably collect dust in the anime section of the video store.5/5 Only beaten in the anime stakes by Ghost in the Shell (2nd) and Akira (1st). Pure genius.",Perfect Blue
535,The Celebration,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0551763/,"Having already seen The Idiots I was looking forward to watching this other film from the Dogme stable. It has similarities. It deals with a controversial subject in child abuse, and looks and sounds similar. The film is set in a huge house, where there is a family gathering to celebrate the father's sixtieth birthday. His children he has not seen for a long time start to arrive, along with other relatives. The first one we see is Christian, his eldest son, a quiet but troubled man. He is walking down a desolate road on his way to the house, and is passed by a car with his younger brother Michael, his wife, and three children in it. The car stops and they greet each other, then Michael throws his wife and kids out and tells them to walk the rest of the way. This is our first glimpse at Michael's crudeness. He turns out to be a bigoted ruffian. The other main character is their sister Helene, who has a coloured boyfriend. This causes problems later when he arrives, and he is racially insulted by Michael, who also conducts a racist song by all the guests. There is always a troubling menace underneath the surface of this film. The scene where Christian gives his first speech sets the tone of the film, and leaves us to ponder. We also learn another sister committed suicide, and left a revealing note, which Helene reads out late in the film. It is always fascinating to watch. Very powerful stuff once again from the Dogme stable. It certainly has its unique and effective style, and always keeps the viewer watching. Superb film making.",N/A
536,The Celebration,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0551727/,"First of all, the home video camera style, casting and editing perfectly suited the subject matter and script.  Wealthy and overbearing patriarch is feted on the occasion of his 60th birthday -- extended family and hangers-on gather with some of the best and worst aspects of our culture on display. It's also a rather sad occasion, as one of daddy's daughters killed herself not long ago, but several guests mention how ""nice"" the funeral was, and which room is mine?  Eldest son rises to give a toast to the old man -- and out comes some unpleasantness that people would either prefer to pretend they didn't hear, or stuff forcefully back down his throat.  Then the fun really starts.Thanks to the cast for acting with restraint -- and being believable.Some very black humour (including pathetic scenes of the decadent bourgeoisie at play), none of it gratuitous, some of it damning, some just outrageously funny.  But this is not a light film in any sense.  Guess what really happens when the victimised family member tells the truth?  Ouch! What about when mommy gets to choose between husband and child?  Double ouch!!  And finally, when victim asks dad why he did it -- well, prepare for the blow to the old solar plexus...Trust me, I know.  This is how it really happens.  It's good to see a well-crafted film (that gives its human themes paramount importance) on this subject.  I'm tired of watching films which try to make me feel sorry for rich kids whose parents just don't understand how hard it is to be a rich kid with pimples.As the families (one in ten?) with histories like this one can attest, being ""dysfunctional"" would have been a very happy place to be, compared to the reality as shown in this fine film.",N/A

The young boy, Josue, learns to live again. Each is so clearly delineated and so clearly defined that the film is a pleasure from beginning to end.Central Station actually beat ""Life is Beautiful"" at some of the world's top awards ceremonies for that year, and you can see why. Its acting is superb, and Walter Salles' direction is with a masterly touch. The cinematography, evoking that desaturated, golden world of Brazil is beautiful - it's a lesson in itself on how to make an apparently 'gritty' world very beautiful.

On second viewing, the film still packs quite an impact, as it still feels real. The work of Walter Salles and Fernanda Montenegro was amazing then, and still is now.This is the story about a cynic and jaded woman who resorts to do menial work and who is a small con artist herself. Dora has seen better days. She is retired now, but in order to make ends meet, she sets a letter writing desk at Rio's train station where she writes letters dictated to her by the illiterate and eager people who can't do the job as they want to communicate with distant family and friends through Dona Dora. In many cases, as it's the case with the letter she has written for Ana, she has no intention of ever sending those missives dictated to her by the unsuspecting people.Josue, the small boy, who witness the death of his mother, is wiser for his younger years than one might suspect. He sees right through Dora as a charlatan and a con woman. When Dora takes the boy home, she has no intentions of ever helping him much more than a few days. Later, upon learning about the adoption agency, she sells the boy to the unscrupulous people involved in the traffic of children for a thousand dollars without any problems. It's only when her friend Irene tells her the fate that Josue will encounter, that Dora leaps into action.Since she can't stay home without having to return her money, she takes Josue on the road. This odd couple begins the journey as complete strangers, but this voyage will make them appreciate one another and even move Dora into becoming a better woman for having the courage to do the right thing. Josue also realizes that Dora, in her own way, has been, for however short, the mother he lost in the tragic accident.Fernanda Montenegro, perhaps Brazil's best actress, is amazing as Dona Dora. She is the whole reason for seeing the movie. Her Dora is one of the best creations in her film career. This intense performer shows an actress who fully understand who Dora is and the way she would behave in the situation. Young Vinicius Oliveira is a sweet Josue, and Marilia Pera, is the kind Irene, who makes Dora see the monstrosity of what she was about to do.The music by Jacques Morelembaum and Antonio Pinto is an asset, as it adds an atmosphere to the long journey of Dora and Josue. The interesting cinematography by Walter Carvalho, shows the immensity of Brazil's interior as the odd couple go to find the little boy's father.This film is a triumph for both Walter Salles and Fernanda Montenegro.","Central Station (also known as ""Central do Brasil"" in Portuguese)"

Intelligent, funny, tragic, and deeply moving, we'd be so lucky to ever see an American animated film strike such chords again. The look of the film is superb, and it's underlying themes and messages resonate even more strongly today. Containing a boldly pacifist theme, the film tells a story of a mechanism of war--meant to destroy--that, through the innocence of a little boy, learns to sacrifice in the name of peace and understanding, as apposed to killing in the name of ownership and power. I hope,as years pass, more and more people come to discover this gem so that they can share their experience with the Iron Giant, as well.",The Iron Giant

Even though the man hasn't really been able to prove a lot with his work as a director, I must say that I almost always appreciate him as an actor. He's perhaps not the most popular actor in Hollywood, but in my opinion he sure is one of the better ones.In this movie he plays the role of Karl Childers, a grown, but simple man who is released from the psychiatric hospital where he has been hospitalized since the age of twelve. He had to stay in that hospital for so long because he murdered his own mother and her lover, believing that they were doing something wrong. He returns to the town where he lived the first twelve years of his life and it doesn't take long for him to get a job as a mechanic, fixing all kinds of small motors at a local repair shop. In the same town he also meets Frank, a young and friendly boy who immediately seems to like this strange man. Soon Karl is invited by Frank's mother to stay in their garage, much against the will of her alcoholic and abusive boyfriend Doyle. While Karl's friendship with Frank gets stronger, the tension between him and Doyle keeps building up, until reaching its final climax...Now that I've finally seen this movie, I can only say that it's too bad that I didn't give it a try earlier. Especially thanks to the magnificent performance by Billy Bob Thornton, this is a movie that is more than just worth a watch. But also the other actors like Dwight Yoakam, Natalie Canerday,... did a very good job. The entire movie feels very realistic, is quite sober and never tries to be too dramatic. This is the kind of movie that could have become very preachy, but it hasn't and that's something that I really appreciate. Add to this some good directing and you know that Thornton has done a very nice job with this movie.This isn't exactly a typical Hollywood movie, not in its story and certainly not in its approach towards the subject. This could easily have become some kind of cheesy TV-movie, but Billy Bob Thornton has made a very good movie out of it instead.

My heart went out to the two lead characters as they struggled to make sense of the mutual bond unearthed by Ms. Jean-Baptiste's character. At once confused, hurt, shocked and afraid, Ms. Blethyn is completely convincing in her role. I was moved by her decision to enter into a relationship with this woman whom she had never before met. Perhaps the fact that Ms. Blethyn and Ms. Jean-Baptiste had never been introduced prior to the scene in which their two characters meet added to the realism of that moment. And Ms. Jean-Baptiste's portrayal of a woman who is surprised by her discovery and not a little disappointed was dead-on, as is her dogged determination to get what she came after.

This was one of them. Like a great piece literature, painting, poetry, speech it has the capacity to change the way you feel and think. It is the biggest compliment I can pay to a film. I rank Groundhog Day with Seventh Seal, Wild Strawberries, Waking Life, Synecdoche New York, Tokyo Story, Ikiru as one of the moves that has the capacity to change.It is anything but a preachy film as the ""intro"" to the review might suggest. In fact it an extremely entertaining and funny film with one of the best performances ever by Bill Murray. The plot revolves around a weather man (Bill Murray) is reluctantly sent to cover a story about a weather forecasting ""rat"" (as he calls it). This is his fourth year on the story, and he makes no effort to hide his frustration. On awaking the 'following' day he discovers that it's Groundhog Day again, and again, and again. First he uses this to his advantage, then comes the realization that he is doomed to spend the rest of eternity in the same place, seeing the same people do the same thing every day.The challenge here for the makers was in terms of screenplay, editing and performances. Bear in mind that, the ""loops"" Bill Murray's character goes through, might become redundant for the audience after a while. This is where the genius of Harold Ramis and Bill Murray comes into play, who seem to introduce a ""novelty"" factor with every shot of the same sequence. I couldn't think of any actor other than Murray who could have pulled this one off.It is a movie likely to deceive you in its effortless narrative and casual comic tone. Yes, it is funny, but make no mistake about it, it is a film with a strong philosophical undertone. This is a quality that separates Groundhog from rest of the movies with similar intent. It tells you what it intends to on your terms. It deals with the questions that bother us for a better part of our lives i.e. meaning of life, purpose of life, existentialism, death, god but never preaches, nor propels any propaganda. But by the end of it, you know that something has changed, something you didn't see coming has happened. And then you watch it again only to realize the moment of Epiphany that eluded you the first time.Every time I am down or losing perspective this is the movie that eases everything and makes me ask a simple question, ""What is important?"". One of the absolute great films of the 90s, but more than just a film for me.",Groundhog Day

Growing up more or less together, all three start out as gang bangers, but each has a different destiny and in many ways one's destiny is caused by the actions of the others.Borrego gets injured in a gang retaliation and works hard to not become a cripple. He does however become both a painter of note and a drug addict of considerable appetite. A tragedy there sets him and Bratt apart.Bratt also winds up in a feud with Chapa. When both were young gang bangers and looking to retaliate for Borrego, Bratt and Chapa are arrested. Because this was Bratt's first offense he got a choice of the military or jail time and he chose the Marines. Chapa however was sent to prison, to San Quentin to be precise where he joined the Chicano prison gang La Onda. Pretty soon Chapa is high in the gang councils and deep in the politics of the prison. Bratt in the meantime joins the LAPD and destiny makes these two collide.Bound By Honor has an epic quality almost a kind of Chicano Gone With The Wind. The mostly Hispanic cast do a great job in depicting life in the Barrio. The film runs just about three hours and it's a tribute to director Taylor Hackford that your interest doesn't flag for a minute.Hackford also creates many interesting supporting characters two numerous to mention, always the mark of a good film. But your interest is always in the three leads.

His acting is grand, superb, majestic, heart-wrenching, deep, emotional, so forth. His portrayal of a blind man dangling in the rope of his life, is not only credible but immensely touching. We see directly, through his crystalline performance all of the pain that griefs on his character. Any other actor would have given a corny, over the top performance. Pacino is the Ace.Chris O' Donnell gives also a fantastic performance, shy and unsure will start to understand Colonel Frank Slade in a short trip that will change their future lives. This movie is not Hollywood Rubish. Martin Brest directs a movie that hits no cheap feelings and floods on great emotions that immediately contact the viewer. You have to be rock solid to not be touched.A masterpiece, one of the best studies on man's desperation, helped by wonderful performances and and a stirring, poignant script, with no wasted lines. You will raise goosebumps with scenes like the tango scene, you will laugh, you will cry, you will feel empathy, sorrow, anger. Isn't this movie the Holy Grail of Emotions.Don't miss it. One of a kind.",N/A
552,JFK,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3561428/,"The first film in Oliver Stone's films about the American presidency, JFK is a historical drama exploring a popular conspiracy theory regarding John F. Kennedy's assassination, adapted from the books On the Trail of the Assassins by Jim Garrison and Crossfire: The Plot That Killed Kennedy by Jim Marrs. On November 22, 1963, President John F. Kennedy was shot and killed in Dallas, Texas, allegedly by Lee Harvey Oswald (Gary Oldman). The inciting incident occurs when New Orleans District Attorney Jim Garrison notices several inaccuracies in the Warren Report (the official investigation of the assassination) and decides to reexamine the case of Kennedy's death. Garrison and his team pursue the truth at all costs, and eventually take Kennedy's death to court to ask: who really is responsible for killing the President?Clocking in at more than three hours, the film has a definite focus on its story, with every element of the film being used to further the plot. Garrison is a modern hero in the film, a city DA that rises to the enormous challenge of investigating the President's assassination. Kevin Costner seems to perfectly capture this type of character (also achieving a thick, charming southern accent) and connecting with the viewers. He is surrounded by an all-star supporting cast, all of which truly become the real life figures they portray. Stone writes believable and engaging dialogue, but since the film focuses so heavily on story, he spends little time developing the characters. Oliver Stone is a controversial director, and his style can be very polarizing, but personally, I enjoyed his strange method of storytelling. The costumes seemed appropriate for the setting, and the set designs were extraordinary, particularly the recreations of 1960s city streets such as Dallas and New Orleans.John Williams was responsible for writing the film's score, and was nominated for an Oscar for his efforts. Williams was busy writing the score for Hook around the same time, so he actually wrote themes for the film before the film was shot. This resulted in Stone cutting and editing the film to the music, instead of the typical method of fitting the music to the film. Williams gives JFK a tragic, but heroic theme, but also incorporates pulsing synthesizers for the investigative scenes (an unusual tactic for the composer). This resulted in an effective score and a seamless integration with the film. The cinematography was unusual, but played a very important role in the story. The film opens with a montage of newsreel clips from JFK's presidency. It slowly intersperses Stone's own clips, but the lighting and coloring (black-and-white and grainy film) make the clips all seem genuine. Much of the film is shot in this manner, giving a very real sense to the story, very similar to a documentary. I can honestly say this film would not have been the same had it not been for this unique approach to cinematography.JFK (rated R) contains strong language throughout, and the assassination scenes may be too graphic for young viewers. The 3-hour runtime will bore some; however, any lover of historical dramas or investigative thrillers will finish the film asking for more. The film is an emotional journey, and viewers will always find themselves rooting for Garrison and his seemingly impossible quest. I give this film a B+, finding it ""guilty"" of keeping me on the edge of my seat.",JFK
553,JFK,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5890841/,"Is there any crime or event in American history that has more mystery surrounding it than JFK's assassination? The number of books, lectures, articles etc. dedicated to it could fill the Superdome. For Americans anyway, it is up there with who is Jack the Ripper, who built the pyramids, and did we really land on the moon. OK. Take out that last one. I just wanted to see if you were paying attention.""JFK"" was a magnificent movie. I've only watched a handful of three-hour movies in my life (Ghandi, Malcolm X, Heat, Lion of the Desert, Das Boot, and maybe a couple of others), yet I don't think any captivated me as much as this one did. I figured it only had high marks because of the subject matter or because of a strong cult following. Well, if that's the case, count me as a cult member.For a three-hour movie with little to no action and much deliberation and dialogue, this movie did wonderfully. I attempted to read a voluminous book on the JFK assassination, but I petered out after one volume and I'd only gotten as far as detailed evidence about the bullet. ""JFK"" goes into the assassination like nothing I've seen or heard before. I'd probably say that not a thing was left out. There was even real footage which came in incredibly handy during the movie.No expense was spared in this film and no corners were cut. They went all out with quality actors, a flawless script, and seamless cohesive plot. This is exactly what you'd want to see from a movie detailing the JFK assassination: put the rat on the table and address the elephant in the room. I didn't think Oliver Stone could outdo ""Born on the Fourth of July,"" I was wrong.",JFK

One difference between this and other movies is also that the camera often is more away from the characters or the plot. So you know that what you see is exactly what is happening. That's why it feels all real: Real Sioux, real fights. You never have the feeling of missing something due to fast cutting and closeups. It's hard for me to believe this movie is not in the top 250 on IMDb all time list. Without question my favorite movie. We live in a strange world when Pulp Fiction ranks #18, and Dances with Wolves just misses the top 250.",Dances with Wolves
556,Dances with Wolves,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0959913/,"It's hard for me to believe that fourteen years have passed since I first saw this movie. I was only ten at the time, and this was the first movie I ever saw that was both an eye-filling and a mind-filling spectacle. It was also one of only two theater-going experiences that I ever had with my late grandmother, and I always think of her when I watch this movie. It always takes me back to an earlier time in my life no matter how many times I see it.This is one movie that could only have been made in the post-Vietnam era, when Americans began to question the moral integrity of their country. How else to explain, in the opening sequence depicting the Civil War, the utter cynicism of the soldier who speaks with Costner's Dunbar character? Or Dunbar's later observation that ""there was no dark political objective"" to the Sioux battling the Pawnee? The scene in which Dunbar receives his orders from the mentally ill major also seems to speak of Vietnam, the point being I think that while an entire generation of young men was being cut down in the Civil War the West was being managed by those who were not fit for duty in the larger conflict. Maury Chaykin, in that one scene, gives one of the most memorable and haunting performances I've seen in any film.This movie's depiction of Native Americans is not nearly as politically correct as it may seem to those who watch it only once or only at a superficial level. In the very first scene depicting Indians, in fact, a Pawnee brave shoots one of the white characters full of arrows and then scalps him. The unrepentant villainy of Wes Studi's character, in particular, recalls the moral simplicity of countless earlier Westerns.Even the most sympathetic Indian character in the movie, Kicking Bird, is not kind to Dunbar merely to be friendly but because he believes he can get useful information out of the white soldier about the other whites who are encroaching on Sioux territory. The interaction between Dunbar and the Sioux is powerfully effective precisely because the Sioux remain true to themselves. They are not cartoonishly hostile like the Indians depicted in old Westerns, but they are not soft or naïve either. While this movie draws its inspiration from American epics as diverse as The Birth of a Nation (1915) and The Searchers (1956), its originality lies not only in its respect for Native Americans but also in its intensely personal treatment of the main character. Few other three-hour epics (Lawrence of Arabia and Braveheart come to mind ) have developed their protagonists as fully and dynamically as this movie develops Costner's Dunbar character.Even after fourteen years, the Dunbar character's arc, going from a suicidal soldier in the opening sequence to an adopted Sioux who in the final scenes puts the needs of his people ahead of his own, is still one of the most remarkable I've seen in any movie. Costner's performance won no awards that I know of, but it provides the movie's indispensably tight focus. He's completely convincing every step of the way, if a bit too clumsy and self-effacing at times, hitting his head in the dark and fainting after a confrontation in a heavy-handed attempt to demystify the West.Another quality this movie shares with The Searchers is that it associates the physical challenges of the frontier with the testing of the soul. The Dunbar character cleans out the watering hole at the fort because he refuses to lose his humanity like the men before him who abandoned the fort. Later he cannot decide whether he feel more or less at home in the presence of the Sioux, because he is struggling to remain true to himself even as he remains unsure of who he is.This movie probably disappoints viewers who are looking for sheer entertainment. It's a quiet, thoughtful story, and although there is action in it the focus is on how the action transforms the characters (particularly Dunbar) rather than on the action itself. You won't see any computer-generated comic-book characters in this movie, but you will see real people having real conversations, and you'll see Costner and costar Mary McDonnell engaging in such intimate and convincing love scenes that you'll forget they're acting!If I could rate the musical score for this movie by itself I'd give it a perfect 10, because it's one of the best I've ever heard, able to stand on its own but fitting the movie like a glove. It is sentimental without being schmaltzy, noble without being pretentious. Best of all, it captures the hesitant emotions of the story, the sense of curiosity overcoming fear and becoming trust.Only this movie's extreme length works against its total success, particularly in the special edition that runs nearly four hours. The three-hour theatrical version is still long, but it's difficult to say what should have been left out of it.Some people still resent the fact that Costner won the Best Director Oscar over Scorcese's Goodfellas. There's no question that Scorcese is the better director, but I believe the direction of Dances With Wolves is better than that of Goodfellas. If you disagree with me try this test: imagine that Scorcese did this movie, and Costner directed Goodfellas. It's a question of which directing job is better, not which director is better.Unlike most epics, this movie ends exactly as it should. The final images, such as the journal floating down the river, the white man and the Native American speaking English to each other, and the brave shouting his farewell from the top of a cliff, are so beautiful and dreamlike that they manage to be both joyful and sad. This is a movie that looks into the very fabric of this country's past, and asks us to do the same.Rating: 10 (Good job, everybody.)",Dances With Wolves
557,Do the Right Thing,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1539729/,"A scorching summer day brings racial tensions to their boiling point in a Brooklyn neighborhood. Seen through many points of view Spike Lee paints a convincing and critical picture of tensions in the most diverse city in the USA.The film's strength is its ability to ring true to many sets of ears and especially if you frequent or live in a big city. You always here of events - big and small - on the news and there is usually that element of ""racial tensions"" or ""possible racial motive."" In a city where over 200 different languages are spoken (which can give you an idea of how many distinguishable cultures there are) it is only a natural ingredient for friction between people. Whether you hate the other guy, or are just annoyed that you can't understand him nor he you, when all you want to do is buy some groceries. This film shows many situations of this type and how everyone is, in a sense, innocent and guilty at the same time. If a situation gets out of hand and you have people throwing slurs at each other there is that famous expression: ""he crossed the line."" Well even with critical hindsight, this ""line"" isn't always visible and when it is, it's faint.Spike Lee manages to show that very well and with a lot of diverse characters, hence the film being able to ring true with an equally diverse audience.The only problem is that in today's America the issue is more about class and not just race, though race and class are intertwined. ""Crash"" presented the issue of class and lifestyle a little bit more thoroughly, but in the end felt preachy and unrealistically sentimental. ""Do the Right Thing"" is much tighter and the film's climax and overall impact is more powerful. Also of the note is the terrific acting from the entire cast. --- 9/10Rated R for profanity and some violence",Do the Right Thing

Where to begin with the praise for this movie?  Let's start with the acting.  Dustin Hoffman is my favorite actor, and has been for a while.  I'd watch him in any role.  I was amazed at the way he was able to pull off this role.  I've never seen a more deserved Oscar win.  The vacant stare, the monotone voice, the screaming, it was unbelievable.  Each time I watch it I am floored by his talent.  Tom Cruise is also good, the villain of the story who undergoes such a subtle change that it's almost not visible until nearly the end.  He is, however, perfectly suited for the flashy, egotistical character of Charlie, and I think he did a great job.  The directing was unobtrusive and beautiful, for the most part just letting the action unfold, which is exactly the way it should have been done.  It's a feel-good movie that does that and more, and I think nothing I've seen in the movies is as touching as the scene in the motel where Charlie discovers who ""Rain Man"" really is.  I give this movie a 9.5 out of 10.  Absolutely wonderful.",Rain Man
560,Akira,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1521541/,"I remember the first time i watched this when i was 14, back then it didn't mean much to me i just watched it because of the violence. Growing up i cant count the number of times i have watched it but it seems as though every time i watched it i uncovered something new in the plot. On to the review then; There are two different dubs for this film in English, the initial one i watched on VHS is much better then the one on DVD. The voices match the characters and bring across emotions very well in the VHS dub. In the DVD dub the voices seem alien to the characters personalities, this may be due to the fact that I'm used to seeing the film with the old dub.The animation is very fluid, definitely a revolution in animation. The vast range of colours used really bring the metropolis alive. The start of the film where Kaneda and the crew are riding through the city you get to witness all sorts of sub-environments of the city, from tight alley ways where you can almost sense the deprivation to the bustling streets bright from the flashing neon lights.The characters grow on you the further in to the film you get, at the beginning you can sense friction between Kaneda and Tetsuo, however as the film progresses you understand the past between these two characters and come to terms with their feelings. The colonel is also a very interesting character who seems to represent a beacon of hope constantly attempting to avoid the inevitable catastrophe headed for neo-tokyo.The storyline revolves around two central characters, Tetsuo and Akira. It is heavily emphasised towards revealing what the next evolution of man is and whether or not the evolution would be in the best interest of man.Closing comments, Akira is a must watch for any anime fan who appreciates a thought provoking storyline and dense characters.Also watch; Ghost in the Shell, Ghost in the Shell:Innocence and Perfect Blue",Akira

562,The Princess Bride,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4797577/,"I find it curious that IMDB lists this soley as an adventure fantasy film. It is, partially, but I've always viewed it as an amazingly well done parody.It pokes fun of the fairy tale tropes while at the same time paying tribute to the genre. All the exaggeration about true love, evil princes, and torture chambers is on point. Its a self aware movie that plays up to its its biggest strength, the characters.Every character in the film is memorable, even down to the preist who only has a few lines. The casting and writing of these characters all came together and it really shows. You just cant help but wish Wallace Shawn survived longer so his loveable villian character could get a little more screentime.All in all, you should give this film a chance.

563,Wings of Desire,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2101286/,"Before I begin, allow me to say that I am not some blockbuster-movie junkie who only watches action movies with a lot of special effects, where the main character beats all his enemies, manages to win one million bucks and a beautiful lady by the end of the movie. I am no stranger to long and slow-paced movies. My favorite directors include Andrej Tarkovski, Luis Bunuel, Aki Kaurismaki, to name a few.But ""Der Himmel über Berlin"" is a pure horror. As you probably learned by now, the movie is about two angels wandering the streets of Berlin and listening to people's thoughts. This is amusing for few minutes, all right, but goes on for more than 90 minutes. And the thoughts the angels are listening to are pointless, hold no message whatsoever. One of the angels falls in love with a mortal woman and wants to become a mortal himself and spend a life with her. Clearly, the main message of the movie is: spiritual love alone can not fully satisfy even an angel.In a desperate effort to add a dramatic character to this movie, director places it in Berlin; a city torn in two pieces with the wall and city which suffered great destruction and tragedy by the end of WWII. OK, the history of Berlin and Berliners is dramatic, but it should not be present in this movie, where central point is supposed to be the internal conflict in one of the angels, caused by feelings toward a mortal woman. To my mind, placing this movie in Berlin only proves that director was aware that his main story is to weak on its own. I really had to put a big effort to last through this movie. But I said to myself: ""Don't give up, wait and see what will happen when the angel finally becomes mortal and meets the love for which he gave his eternity. But even that was pathetic. He met her 8 (eight) minutes before the movie ended, and it was one of the most pathetic and naive love scenes ever filmed.The only good point in the movie are the main actress' legs. That is the reason why I give this movie two stars: one for each of her legs.Wings of desire leaves certainly a lot to be desired for.",Wings of Desire
564,Wings of Desire,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0245323/,"There are so many comments written about this movie, I almost don't want to write anything - but here I am anyway :)Though everyone is entitled to their own opinion, it disturbs me to read negative comments that WOD is 'too slow' or that Wenders should have been a still life photographer. I think that some people are missing the point of this movie. Wenders filmed this after having been part of the Hollywood machine for several years, and had grown sick of the cookie cutter films that were (and still are) being made in that tradition to produce ticket sales. Yes, this movie doesn't have loads of action and car chase scenes and guns and sex. It does offer some interesting perspectives. The consistent third person view and 'objectification' of the viewer is one aspect. Watching WOD, you don't feel the typical draw into the movie as so often is the case, but rather are a bystander, looking through a window, with your own thoughts and ideas a part of the movie, not the other way around. WOD doesn't allow you to become a subjective part of the film; it 'pushes' you away from empathizing. Even the camera angles and shots motivate this sentiment. The goal and direction of the film are presented without struggle or thought; you know that Damiel wants to be with Marion. He tells Cassiel this, and the only question is - how will he achieve this goal? WOD belies a sense of traditional film-making. Peter Falk is presented as perhaps the 'idea' of history as fans call out 'Colombo!' The angels are bound to Berlin, existing in a purgatory neither heaven or hell, unable to communicate. The trapeze artist from a traveling circus representing freedom - not only freedom from an everyday lifestyle, but also the key to Damiel's freedom. This movie contains so many interesting ideas and perspectives, that when watched with an open, curious mind, it is fascinating, mesmerizing, calming and inspirational. Filmed entirely in Berlin, the city is not a traditional definition of beautiful. But the industrial, modernist, post WW II reconstructed Berlin is stunning and diverse, providing the perfect background for this modern classic. I cannot recommend this movie enough. But please watch it with open eyes. In the same sense you cannot listen to the music of Schoenberg or Stravinsky as you would Mozart, you cannot watch Wings of Desire as you would a Spielberg movie.",Wings of Desire

Miyazaki's works have never cease to amaze me.  Laputa is an adventure of a grand scale and I wonder how a film can be so packed with details and imagination.  Ask yourself this question: if you are a kid dreaming of an adventure so grand in scope and so magical, what would it be like?  The answer would be to strap yourself in some seat and watch Laputa, because it's truly a childhood fantasy come true.

Unlike Seven Samurai, my favorite all-time film and I believe the best film ever made, it is not a western. Although epic, it is about a sweet and rueful soul swallowed by karma and history. It is redemptive without overt sentiment, and the lead performance by Tatsuya Nakadai is nuanced and unforgettable.

The film is deceptively straightforward and uncomplicated on the surface, but is rich and complex upon reflection.  The film is very enigmatic (even the title seems to make no sense, even though it seems like it should) and lends itself to interpretation.  This is one of those films that you have to talk about after seeing it, and you'll find endless points of view to consider.  More than that, however, this film is historically fascinating.

You have got to like Tony Robbins, a square jawed ladies man in many of Woody Allen's movies (Radio Days, A midsummer nights sex comedy, Play it again Sam). You don't mind seeing Robbins type cast because you instantly know that he is going to be the perfect opposite of Allen's angst filled Alvy.Another Woody Allen directing feature that I happen to like is his use of the split screen and the fixed screen. In both, the camera doesn't move thereby forcing you to get involved in the dialogue. These techniques work because Woody Allen has strong, tight dialogue and truly dramatic actors.Many of the scenes from the late 70's and early 80's are wonderful to watch because they reflect the matter of fact mores and fads of the time: Snorting cocaine was cool, the veggie-burger-tofu California scene, the liberal Columbia college satire.Listen carefully to the background chatter during the California scene at Tony Lacey's house with swinging' hip background music. Hysterical lines that you can use in your office today: ""Right now it is only a notion, but I think I can get the money to make it into a concept then later turn it into an idea."" Woody Allen has satirized and captured the language and mind set of the entire movie/music industries. A memorable scene is when Alvy pulls Marshall McLuhan out from behind a movie placard to refute some bombastic guy pontificating about McLuhan's poetry. You wish you could do the same.Truly a great movie that ages well and has a sweet message about romance.",Annie Hall
574,Jaws,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2040206/,"Synopsis: A police chief of a popular summer retreat island finds the tourist season in jeopardy when a great white shark attacks. With the mayor pressuring him to keep the beaches open for financial reasons, he teams up with a marine scientist and a certifiable fisherman to hunt the beast. My Take: Is there a better horror film out there? I say no. This movie has it all, jumps, tears, laughter, and (most importantly) tension. Spielberg proved out of the gate that he knows where all of your strings are and that he can pluck any single one at will. What makes this film so incredible isn't the shark at all. It's the people. They are real three dimensional characters who share our fears and feelings. A simple example being when one mother walks up, slaps the police chief and sobs, ""My boy is dead. I wanted you to know that."" Recommendation: I would also recommend Spielberg's made for T.V. movie Duel.",Jaws

576,Dog Day Afternoon,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0140846/,"This amazing film somehow manages to capture the dense texture of real life. Improvisational acting, no artificial lighting, no costumes or makeup other than what was essential to the character, and no musical score help make it that way.  So do intense performances from Al Pacino, John Cazale, and Charles Durning.  Frank Pierson's screenplay was well-constructed, although 60% of the dialogue was improvised.  It allowed room for moving drama, so-surreal-it-could-only-happen-in-real-life comedy, and quite a bit of suspense.  The characters are sketched out incredibly well, with even minor ones having their own ""moments.""

577,Dog Day Afternoon,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1089114/,"I've watched this film for the third time in a few years last night. Instead of writing a straight review, I'd like to jot down ten thoughts just off the top of my head concerning this exquisite movie: 1) Watching this film will change forever your perception of the bank heist genre, making you question the contrived cinematic conventions these films usually make use of.2) The source of this film's paradoxical and/or farcical elements spring from life itself, not from film or pre-existing cinematic conventions. Sometimes, the absurdities of life are so great, they dwarf those included in any form of fiction. Without even trying to make that point, this film captures that concept beautifully. 3) Its tone in relation to the homosexual theme is ahead of its time. In fact it's ahead of OUR time, even, in hardly making an issue out of it at all - it just IS. 4) It captures the climate of the 70s in a manner so sober, you'll remember its unshowy yet authentic feel forever.5) Lumet's film brings to life the concept of the distorting lens of the media and how different groups with different agendas will turn an outlaw into a hero, with far more efficiency than Oliver Stone's brash, bloated, childish and repetitive Natural Born Killers.6) Watching this film will illustrate to the younger generations exactly why Al Pacino has earned himself the legendary status he probably no longer would deserve with his performances of the last 10 years alone. **SPOILERS**: Just watch those last ten minutes of him handcuffed against the bonnet of a car, where he doesn't say a word, but speaks volumes with his eyes and his soul just oozing out of every frame at the end of the movie; you'll remember those eyes for as long as you live! 7) Watching this film, you'll realise that firing a gun-shot is a BIG DEAL in real life, and that other films make too much use of gun fire in a highly contrived way. 8) All that tension deriving from pointed guns unable to fire a shot OR move away you realise Tarantino must've taken notes sometime along the way. 9) No genre is old or done too many times before if it's handled with this amount of freshness, inspiration and talent. 10) Watching Dog Day Afternoon for the third time has filled me with the same amount of wonder at the power of truly inspired but unobtrusive film-making as it did first time round.",N/A

579,Papillon,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5616991/,"In my top 20 films of all time. Probably the best performance both Steve McQueen and Dustin Hoffman have ever given in a film enthused with absorbing detail in every scene, not only of the harshness of Devil's Island but of the psychological impact on the main players and the injustice and cruelty of the life sentences. It works on two levels - psychological and emotional whilst at the same time tells an exciting and dramatic story of escape. It's riveting cinema that went unrewarded by critics - shame on them. Thankfully its proved amongst the public to be an enduring classic.",Papillon
580,Papillon,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1967535/,"Henri 'Papillon' Charriere, was a lifetime inmate under the French government's harsh penal system in French Guiana. In his declining years he wrote his memoirs describing his years of incarceration, his cruel mistreatment and daring, multiple escapes. Weather or not he was the actual character of his own book, is disputed to this day. But the fact that he was an inmate is true enough and fits in with the actual site which came to be known as 'Devil's Island.' Court records indicate that Henri Charriere (Steve McQueen) later called "" Papillon "" which is french for Butterfly, was indeed a minor burglar and safe cracker. His claim he was innocent of murder, may be true enough, due to an unreliable source accusing him in court, yet producing little supporting evidence. Nevertheless, the infamous thief was given a twenty year sentence, which was extended due to his numerous escapes. During his imprisonment, he becomes lifelong friends with an equally famous treasury forger named Louis Dega (Dustin Hoffman). Don Gordon (a real life friend of McQueen) plays Julot, an experienced prisoner with his own intentions of escape. Anthony Zerbe is hideously interesting as Toussaint, a ravaged leper, who aids escaping prisoners. The entire film is one remarkable story and becomes an incredible journey, one which transcends the screen and offers audiences, the raw reality of life under the most severe and brutal penal systems in the world. The infamous 'Devil's Island ' today has become synonymous with a hellish place of unspeakable conditions. A fantastic movie for those in search of true-life Classic. ****",Papillon

583,Sleuth,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1894873/,"Yes it goes without saying that a project as ambitious as this was bound to have flaws, and Sleuth (1972) does have a few, mostly niggling, but one quite major. But as others have pointed out already, any sort of made up disguise under the bright glare of studio lights and the close scrutiny of cine-cameras is nigh on impossible to pull off, even today, 35 yrs later - just look at all the TV shows that disguise their presenters to fool the public and you will very rarely be fooled as a viewer. The plot demanded that this disguise scene was essential, and so they just got on with it and did the best they could with making it look believable. I thought they did a reasonable job with it, myself, and no it wasn't undetectable, but it was good enough not to look embarrassingly abysmal. Don't forget though, that essentially this was a piece of theatre still, filmed or not, and there were many other clear pointers to this being a stage mystery and not a flat out naturalistic, trying to be real thriller - none more so than the casting of Mr. Olivier, and the wordy script, so the unlikely disguise factor was not alone in pricking viewers' bubbles. When you watch filmed theatre you have to do a certain amount of belief suspending, or at least re-aligning your priorities as to what you want out of the piece. Too many people it seems, who have said it doesn't work, either are not making this necessary allowance for it on credibility terms, or much more sadly really, just do not know that there is a difference between filmed theatre and pure cinema.That this movie has engrossed so many over the years surely speaks of its overall success, despite the little flaws. And despite a lack of visual credibility being too much for some (seemlingly weened on nothing but Hollywood and TV for visual entertainment), this movie is an outstandingly successful and popular piece of entertainment, unlike many, many realistic thrillers and mysteries. It shows that theatrical writing, theatrical sets, and probably most of all, damned fine theatrical acting can still be as good as anything the grittiest and most worldly, realistic film makers can produce. I believe this is a masterpiece of old fashioned civilised entertainment and I love the OTT acting. Olivier shows off his very best high camp style of acting and proves yet again that it can be very cinematic, and Caine puts in one of his best 'I'll show them I can act' performances to give acting lovers a rare treat here. Lovers of detective novels are also very well catered for in this ever fabulous movie. A rightly acclaimed classic.",Sleuth (1972)

Several memorable scenes. Oscar-worthy performance from Ben Johnson. But I kept expecting a plot to pop up and make itself seen. Essentially the movie was one scene after another of country people rutting like hogs. Sure, I realize that's one of the themes of the movie, but ultimately, when Sam died the life of the picture went with it. Aside from Sam I couldn't get interested in any other character.

586,The Last Picture Show,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0117697/,"One of my favorite films is The Last Picture Show.   It is a film that was directed by Peter Bogdanovitch in 1971, yet almost 30 years later it still seems fresh and alive to me. There is a desolate, spare quality to the 1950's small west Texas town we are invited into and its desolation is apparent to us from the opening scenes.  It was filmed in black and white, which enhances the dramatic quality of the town and takes us back to a simpler time.  Just as our lives are discontinuous, with jarring scene changes and ridiculous episodes of embarrassing events, so is life presented to us in this small town.  The film's purposely jarring editing is transformed in our minds, as we watch, from a disjointed amalgam to a stream of consciousness effect that is very lifelike. One knows, then, that you are entering an alternative world just as real in its way as your own.  This movie pulls you in.There is no musical score in this film in the normal sense.  The only time you hear music is when a radio is on or a phonograph is playing in the background.  This lack of a musical score dubbed over the film enhances the illusion of reality.  Another aspect of this sound editing is the choice of music that is being played by the different characters.  Bogdonavitch uses song and artist selection to subtly comment on the character of the person or people who are listening to it.  In the case of Sonny the music he selects is always Hank Williams and it alludes to the hardscrabble life and down to earth quality of his character.   In contrast at JC's home, the manipulative teenager played by Cybil Sheppard, you hear a cover of a Hank William's song that has all of the life sucked out of it, similar to a Pat Boone cover of an Elvis Presley song.  It is a direct comment on JC and her family; her family has grown wealthy by owning oil wells and they pretend they are still the same people as before.  It is obvious they are not just by this simple musical selection.  It is eloquent in its simplicity.
The center of the film and the major theme  should you listen to your heart or your libido if the two don't combine in the same person?  Perhaps the saddest comment in this film is that too often these two halves to a whole do not come together as a package and people are forced to chose.   None of the characters are particularly happy with their mates.  Everyone is on the prowl for that perfect person they know they will be happy with. Time and again they think that they've found the perfect person based on their sexual attraction but when they begin to show their authentic selves are then rejected.   Those in long term relationships with an emotionally compatible mate but with no sexual interest face an equal dilemma  a lack of excitement and joy  and are destined to be the ones that reject.   It exposes both sides of this human dilemma, a duality that can become split and non-integrated, and does it in a sophisticated and lyrical way.   Most people experience this split at some time and in this film, as in life, there are no easy answers.  That's why I love this film.And there is Billy, the boy who continually sweeps the street in a hopeless gesture to turn back the inevitable, representing that demented and futile longing for a past that was never quite as good as you remember it.  He represents that longing for an illusion that disappears just as we are about to grasp it and the sadness of that.  The broom that is never fast enough for the blowing dust of time.",The Last Picture Show
587,The Conformist,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1729104/,"I heard much about this film, and was looking forward to finally watching it on DVD. First, to give it all justice it deserves, the cinematography is brilliant - the film is full of mesmerising shots, and even though I often feel uneasy when I am made too conscious of cinematography, in this film it worked perfectly, and added much to the story. I also found the acting to be of a very high standard - especially the two female leads, and Jean-Louis Trintignant.However, like some other reviewers, I was not impressed by the writing and the way the narrative was presented. It felt very disconnected, and sometimes confusing, with rough jumps between scenes, often making characterisation deficient. Perhaps it was a conscious decision aimed to convey Marcello's neurotic state and his need to belong, yet I felt that the camera-work alone did the job pretty well, especially the lighting (e.g. in the scene when we first see Guilia, in a striped dress, with moving light source patterned by the blinds, it reflects Marcello's mixed feelings about her), and the unorthodox angles. Also, I still wander if the narrative is objective, or maybe some of the scenes are Marcello's wishful thinking - while watching, I had a theory that the blue light indicated these, but it didn't quite hold up till the end.And, next to the ambiguous episodes, there are some annoyingly blatant parts. The metaphor of blind fascists was just too in-your-face; Marcello's constant speeches about his desire to be normal sounded fake, and generally his character development as defined by the script wasn't handled well; the shadows on the wall during the Plato talk - once again, too predictable (still beautiful, though!); and finally, the murder of Prof. Quadri alluded to Caesar's in such an obvious way that I honestly thought he'd say 'You too, Marcello!'. In itself, it is not a bad thing, but I think it ruined the flow and the tension of the scene, creating a very abstracted picture of treason and cowardice - a much simpler idea could have been more effective. However, I have to say that this scene was then redeemed by Dominique Sanda screaming in front of the car window, and the following chase shot with a hand-held camera.The bit I liked about the plot was the suppressed homosexuality theme, under-stressed but sustained throughout the film with several moments of restrained homoeroticism, and the ending. I also liked the general air of the 30s, and the music - the credits song is currently stuck in my head.Overall, while definitely a landmark of cinematography, The Conformist suffers from the need of a better script - 6/10.",The Conformist

When I saw this on DVD on a nice flat-screen set, I was amazed how good this looked. I had seen it several times before on VHS and hadn't realized how good this was photographed. I just discovered Conrad Hall was the cinematographer, which explains it. Few, if any, were better than him.One remembers this western for several things: the two leads looking over their shoulders incredulous that their pursers seem to be always there; Paul Newman riding a bicycle to the tune of ""Raindrops Keep Falling On My Head,"" the beautiful Katharine Ross, the chemistry of Newman and Robert Redford as a two-man team, on and on. Those three lead actors, with the repartee between them, and the likability of each, make them fun to watch as they dominate this picture. It's just solid entertainment and another example of good film-making that doesn't need a lot of R-rated material to make it successful. Photography-wise, the western scenery was great, there were some wonderful closeup shots and I really liked the tinted old-time footage inserted in here.

590,The Graduate,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2444483/,"The Graduate is about a recent college graduate, Dustin Hoffman, who is unsure about his future and I am left unsure about the movie. The movie is produced and set in the late 60's, probably one of Dustin Hoffman's first movies. Hoffman starts an affair with his dad's business partner's wife, however he falls in love with her daughter and things turn pretty complicated. Because I wasn't very sure how I felt about this movie, I read few reviews on IMDb and to my surprise people are pretty split about this movie as well. Lets start with what I liked, first I thought tackling the idea of being lost, unsure or worried after college is very impressive for that time. the first half of the movie was intriguing and if you are a recent graduate you will probably connect to Hoffman's situation. Although I whole heartedly believe that Dustin Hoffman is a brilliant actor, I thought he was okay in the movie, good acting but not really inspiring. Here I must give it to Anne Bancroft, she was the only one who showed extreme professionally in that movie, she was cold and bold and just a pretty good actress. One of my fav scenes was showing how suffocated Hoffman was.I thought there were good camera angles, lighting, but what I really liked was the editing! for the 60's that movie was really really well edited. I liked the ending how although Hoffman got what he wanted (or maybe thought he wanted) he had this expression on his face of now what? and the music plays my fav track in the movie (though the rest are as good) The Sound of Silence OK...lets see what I didn't like. Well, I thought the movie had really shallow parts and thought Katharine Ross was a bit dumb. I literally laughed out loud at the ending scenes were she started running towards him in the church and the close ups of angry faces that were more of cartoon like expressions with no real emotions. I also thought that Hoffman falling in love with Ross was freaking fast, they had one date! And the second day she knows he was sleeping with her mother, and somehow by the end of the movie she forgives him! how will that even be possible?To wrap it up, I wasn't very interested nor entertained to tell the truth. Yea maybe it was a different movie in the 60's but its not really a classic and I wont recommend it nor do I think it deserves all these Oscar nominations nor being on that top 250 list.",The Graduate
591,The Graduate,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0097754/,"Many people who saw The Graduate on its original release, including critics like Roger Ebert, have misinterpreted the main point of the film.  Ben Braddock is NOT a hero that is supposed to glorify the rebellion of the 60s generation.   The viewer is NOT supposed to stand up and cheer after the final scene.  Ben is supposed to represent the confused state of a college graduate stuck in between youth and adulthood.   As best depicted by the scene where he holds the hotel door open for both the elderly group and the younger group, he feels alienated from both generations.  He does not want to hear the loud music of the car next to him at the drive-thru, nor is he interested in `plastics' or the materialistic pleasures of his parents.He has no idea what he wants out of life, and only thinks that marrying Elaine will be the solution to this problem.  As the last shot depicts (which may be the best final shot in film history), Ben only seems to be happy for a few seconds after he and Elaine get onto the bus with no money, no prospects, and no certain future.  In fact, Nichols cleverly uses Paul Simon's Sound of Silence, and drowns out much of the background sound to show that Ben's is in the same position at the end of the film as he is at the beginning.  He has not found what he really wants to get out of life and is as confused as ever.   This scenario is not dated nor is it only appropriate for the 60s, it can apply to anyone who is lost or has no idea what to do with his or her lives.Nichols' brilliant direction reinforces the complex exploration of confusion and uncertainty.  The flow of shots after he first sleeps with Mrs. Robinson is incredible, as is his use of the swimming pool to enforce his entrapment. He effortlessly switches in and out of focus at different depths of each shot to emphasize certain characters and dialogue.  It goes without saying that the performances by Hoffman and Bancroft are first-rate.  Add Paul Simon's haunting Sound of Silence, Scarborough Fair, and the instrumentals of what would become Mrs. Robinson, and you have songs and images that downright haunting.  As a recent college graduate who was not even born in the 60s, I can say that this film has not dated, and is deserving of its #7 ranking by the American Film Institute.",The Graduate

The big deal at the time was Liz Taylor made up to look old and frumpy. I think she then did a later film called 'Ash Wednesday' to reverse the procedure.Anyway, Liz and Dick were married in real life and it was reported that they had similar encounters with Jack Daniels and boisterous 'conversations' at home, so this should have been a walk-in-the-park acting job for both of them.But, it was awful. The story was repulsive as were all the characters. I feel that trying to analyze drunken behavior in a movie is a pointless endeavor that, for some reason, actors and directors think is a life affirming philosophic inquiry......or something. I would compare this to trying to pass a driving test while drunk. It doesn't work.Burton does his usual Shakespearean speechifying. Taylor is a caricature of whatever she is supposed to be.

593,Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1030368/,"An undisputed classic that chronicles every appalling moment of a drunken night in hell as middle-aged George and Martha tear each other, and their guest, to pieces.Elizabeth Taylor proves categorically that she was a truly great actress. Her Oscar-winning performance as the psychologically tormented Martha is one of the greatest performances in the history of cinema. Taylor's imperceptible shifting from sadism to tenderness, from bullying condescension to exhausted vulnerability, is a masterclass in character building. Martha is a truly monstrous character, and yet Taylor is able to imbue her with sympathy, allowing you brief glimpses of the warm and lovable woman she could have been.Richard Burton is equally magnificent as George; an ageing, failing college professor whose initial meekness gives way to a raging torment all of his own. His verbal sparring with Taylor, like two pit-bulls in the ring of an endless and bloody dogfight, has become legendary. Every word drips with malice and contempt, every sentence is designed to cut the deepest wound. At times, it becomes painful to watch, but like true train-wreck television, you cannot drag yourself away from the inevitably terrible conclusion.Quite possibly, this is as close to perfect as movies can get; beautifully written dialogue, deeply complex characters, an evolving and suspenseful storyline, beautiful photography, and a wonderfully understated score by Alex North.

594,The Sound of Music,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3596666/,"Capitalizing on two ""hot"" properties of the early sixties, director Robert Wise and the infinitely talented Julie Andrews, this film delivers some pure cinematic magic like none before it nor since, especially the sequences which feature the songs ""Do Re Mi"" (#88 on AFI's 100 Top Movie Songs of All Time) through the streets of Salzburg and ""The Lonely Goatherd"", performed with puppets.These, among others, helped it capture the Best Picture Oscar that year over David Lean's Doctor Zhivago (1965), Stanley Kramer's Ship of Fools (1965), A Thousand Clowns (1965), and Darling (1965), which (like Doctor Zhivago (1965), also) features Julie Christie, in her Oscar winning Best Actress performance. Wise, who would later receive the Irving G. Thalberg Award from the Academy, picked up his second Best Director Oscar for this film; Andrews her second consecutive Best Actress nomination (she'd won for her film debut in Mary Poppins (1964)).Written by Howard Lindsay and Russel Crouse (and Maria von Trapp's novel), Ernest Lehman's screenplay tells the story of the Austrian von Trapp family who, after their first public performance as a singing group, fled when Hitler annexed their country (the Anschluss) in March, 1938. The real von Trapp family had performed all over Europe because Maria, with the help of a local priest (fashioned as Max Detweiler, played by Richard Haydn, in the film), had turned the family's hobby into a profession when an Austrian bank crash caused Georg to lose his fortune.Though this musical is almost three hours in length, the plot interspersed with magnificent Rodgers & Hammerstein songs (helping the film to win the Oscar for Best Music, Scoring of Music, Adaptation or Treatment) keep it from feeling overlong.In fact, it's the kind of film, like The Wizard of Oz (1939), that one can watch every year and never tire of it. The title song is #10 on AFI's 100 Top Movie Songs of All Time; ""My Favorite Things"" is #64. And no one can forget (how do you solve a problem like) ""Maria"", sung in part by Marni Nixon (known for dubbing Deborah Kerr, Natalie Wood, and Audrey Hepburn in The King and I (1956), West Side Story (1961), and My Fair Lady (1964), respectively) in one of her only on-screen appearances as Sister Sophia ... or ""Climb Ev'ry Mountain"", ""Edelweiss"" and ""So Long, Farewell"", especially little Kym Karath's ""goodbye"" in the reprise, as the seven year old Gretl. Each of these tunes, and their just right lyrics, move the story along such that one never has cause to look at one's watch to wonder ""when will it end?"". The film's Sound and Editing, as evidenced in the aforementioned ""Do Re Mi"" and ""The Lonely Goatherd"" numbers, also won Academy Awards.Christopher Plummer (whose singing voice was dubbed by Bill Lee) is terrific as the stern aristocrat widower who marries his governess after she, and his children, had helped the Captain to rediscover song, love, and what it means to be a father. The cast of kids is marvelous, the most recognizable of which is Angela Cartwright as Brigitta, who would go on to star in the TV series Lost in Space that same year. Nicholas Hammond, Friedrich, also had a television career which included playing roles in several series, most notably as Spiderman. Heather Menzies's (Louisa) TV career was shorter. Charmian Carr gives a strong performance as the eldest child Liesl who's ""Sixteen going on Seventeen"". Peggy Wood's head Mother Abbess (whose singing voice was dubbed by Margery McKay) earned her a Best Supporting Actress Oscar nomination. Her best line ""Him?!"", after which she immediately excuses Sister Margaretta (Anna Lee), when Maria is telling her why she's returned to the abbey.I also especially like the ""dueling"" Sisters, Margaretta and Berthe (Portia Nelson) who, despite their disparate feelings towards Maria's suitability as a nun, work together to foil the Nazis in the end. Ben Wright plays a credible Herr Zeller. The recognizable Norma Varden is Frau Schmidt, the von Trapp's housekeeper. And to have the great Eleanor Parker in a supporting role as the Baroness, who presumably doesn't sing or perform (she that forgot her harmonica), such ironic and fortunate casting! Also, Maria von Trapp herself appears briefly, uncredited, during the ""I Have Confidence"" number.The film's Color Art Direction-Set Decoration, Cinematography, Costume Design also received Oscar nominations. Plus, besides being added to the National Film Registry in 2001, the film is #55 on AFI's 100 Greatest Movies list and #27 on AFI's 100 Greatest Love Stories list. #41 on AFI's 100 Most Inspiring Movies list. #4 on AFI's 25 Greatest Movie Musicals list.One of the best family movie night film's ever made, make it an annual tradition in yours!",The Sound of Music
595,Doctor Zhivago,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2117067/,"I finally got round to watching this film. I just never got round to seeing it. I love the lengthy epics Like Lawrence of Arabia and Ben Hur so this was pretty much the only gap in this genre I had left.So now the gap is filled. I Love long films which you can get lost in and this, although over 3hrs, did not seem long. It seemed to grab me and accost me into the Russian Revolution along with the characters themselves. I think the film looked great and Curtis Steiger's performance was very accomplished. Omar Sharif (excuse my spelling on the names) was exactly what he needed to be.my issues with the film start with the complete lack of empathy I found I had for the characters. Terrible and monumental things happened to these people and I was following the events but the characters gave me nothing to make me emotionally invested in them. Yuri's throwaway family for instance, we see no mourning for his separation from them; he is only distraught that his wife met his lover not that he may never see her or his two kids again. I seemed to feel more for his situation than he did as he settled down with his surrogate family. We spend a lot of time with the good doctor and the ending does seem a little rushed - I needed to know why and how he managed to evade the persecution which forced him into hiding with Lara? After such a long and sprawling film - the ending seemed to attempt to wrap it all up at a jarred pace compared to the film I just saw.I could have watched another hour, I wanted to know more about what Yuri did and not just have it hinted at by Alec Guiness' character in the bit ""tacked on at the end"".I also would have liked to hear some of Yuri's poetry. Overall I am awed but disappointed. I'm sure this film has many followers (in fact I know) but I found the characters vulnerable but never really threatened and how his wife, son and father-in-law; characters who we've invested in, exit the film was wholly inadequate.All in all, I think many love this film because of either hype or they have had a long running affection for it, what I mean to say is, many film lovers probably came to this much earlier than myself and it was much more powerful than if seen with a more objective gaze. Some may love Lean and so do I but from a naught-to-sixty Doctor Zhivago experience I found it enthralling but flawed.",Doctor Zhivago
596,Doctor Zhivago,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0088953/,"David Lean's ""Doctor Zhivago"" is a classic film, one that will live on as long as their are films.  There are scenes in this movie that will invariably becomeindelibly etched in the viewers imagination:  The opening funeral march through the vast Siberian landscape, the grandeur of the Czarist Russian palaces, the march of the revolutionaries through the Moscow boulevards, the train ridestraight out of Dante's Inferno, the Ice-covered interior of the Zhivago country estate (a truly magical moment in the film), the wealth of beauty captured in the cinematography of this film is astonishing.  Julie Christie's Lara is one of those great screen personas--she becomes a woman of such mysterious beauty.  Thefinal scene of Yuri's desperate attempt to reach her in the crowded SovietMoscow is heartbreaking.  And that music score!  The opening film credits with Jarre's genuinely beautiful music, complete with balalaikas sets the mood for this great, grand entertainment.  One of the best ever!",Doctor Zhivago
597,8½,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0080243/,"Fellini's abstract, artful, surrealistic masterpieces certainly deserve their place in cinematic history, but ""8 1/2"" should not be among them.  I know it's not posh to put down Italy's genius (I seldom see any critics having the balls to do so), but I cannot applaud a respected artist's piece of work simply on name value when, for me, it is meritless as entertainment, does little to stimulate the mind other than to numb it, or further the appreciation of film making.  Mind-altering drugs should not be an option for getting through a difficult movie.  As a result, all ""8 1/2"" did for me was induce drowsiness.  Overlong, laborious, ostentatious, and utterly self-indulgent, this is the kind of movie to see if you are a chronic insomniac.  Folks, put away those expensive and dangerous tablets and pills...try ""8 1/2""..for a nice, safe and restful sleep.Supposedly, this is one of Fellini's most intensely personal projects.  Big deal.  Marcello Mastroianni portrays an obsessed Fellini-like filmmaker in the midst of undertaking a new project, enslaved by weird, warped, surreal visions and concepts that serve as motivators.  A number of foreign beauties (Claudia Cardinale, Anouk Aimee) are entrapped in subplots that go virtually nowhere.  I remember ""Fellini Satyricon"" as being an equally difficult, visually-arresting piece, but at least the director had the sense to make it forbiddenly erotic with its bizarre assortment of characters prancing about in panoramic perversity.Self-analytical, psychological mumbo-jumbo goes just so far.  You remember those inane ""Saturday Night Live"" skits with Gilda Radner that spoofed these heady, overblown Italian movies?  They were pointing their finger at this baby, not ""La Dolce Vita,"" a far better film.If ambiguous, esoteric, highly pretentious art is your thing...go for it. If not, but you feel you'd like to fit in and hold your own in a Fellini(esque) conversation, may I suggest his more plot-friendly ""masterpieces"" -- ""Nights of Cabiria,"" ""La Strada"" or even the slim but delightful ""Ginger and Fred,"" all showcasing the extraordinary talents of Fellini's legendary wife Giulietta Masina.  Come to think of it, perhaps SHE is what this film is missing!",8 1/2
598,Vivre Sa Vie,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1576343/,"I found this movie by accident at my Goodwill store and bought it because it looked like an interesting example of 1960s experimental French cinema of which I am not too familiar. When I started watching I liked the stark black and white simplicity of the film and long before it ended I realized how similar this movie was to PULP FICTION. The girl, Nana, was simply exquisite and similar to Uma Thurman in many ways. I won't go into all the ways this movie is similar to PULP but the thing I noticed right away was how the movie opened with the male and female at the restaurant counter with their backs to the camera. They are talking about breaking up - Vincent and Mia were meeting for the first time. In sum, Tarentino must have seen this movie and used it for many of his ideas.",N/A
599,Vivre Sa Vie,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0079776/,"There is more to this film, in terms of its story, than a woman's descent into prostitution.  To a large extent, it is the story of Godard's failing relationship with Karina.  Or perhaps it presents Godard's overall view of the director's relationship to the actress, the artist's relationship to his subject.Possible spoilers.Aside from Nana, there are three characters crucial to the story: the photographer, the pimp, and the guy who reads excerpts from Poe.  There are two particularly telling scenes: Nana's viewing of Joan of Arc and the subtle appearance of the Elizabeth Taylor photograph behind Nana as the Poe story is read to her.First, the photographer.  He offers Nana her last chance at an entrance into films.  Soon after their meeting she falls into prostitution.  He resembles the pimp in manner.  Are films and prostitution the same?  Rather, are the director and the pimp the same?The real representation of the director is the guy who reads the Poe story. In fact, he represents Godard himself.  This is the guy who buys Nana cigarettes, and when we see Nana consorting with him after all of her degrading experiences, it is like a breath of fresh air.  He is going to glorify her and raise her to the status that she deserves.  He is an artist and he portrays her (""This is our story,"" he says of the Poe story.  ""An artist portraying his love."").  The Poe excerpt ends with the death of the artist's love, his subject.  He drained the life from her and into the canvas.  If this is their story, is the guy draining the life from Nana? Isn't that what the pimp has been doing?  The pimp and the director are the same.Nana sees Joan of Arc judged by men, and she ostensibly relates.  As the Poe story is read, we see the photo of Elizabeth Taylor behind Nana. Godard is encouraging us to judge Nana (or Karina) in comparison to Elizabeth Taylor. She is being killed, just as Joan of Arc was, by this judgement. The director and the pimp are the same.  Godard prostituted Karina, at least he thought so when he wrote this story.  He drained the life from her and into his canvas, the screen, and presented her for our judgement.  Our Nana doesn't realize that whether she had made into films or had fallen into prostitution, the end result would have been the same.  La morte.",N/A
600,The Hustler,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0074459/,"Spoilers herein.Here's a game I play: find the similarities between the story and how the story is told. After all, the same mind makes both decisions. Often there isn't deep reflection on the choices -- they just feel right. But sometimes the relationship shows careful selection of strategies and philosophies.  We see here that the key artists know what they were about and engineered the drama to reflect the dynamics of pool.The story is simple: characters as pool balls, bouncing off of one another, with a particular combination shot resulting in both a death of one and the better placement of another. Every element of the story reinforces this notion. The staging is very abstract, very clean. Cinemascope black and white provides a wide table. But watch these actors. I really appreciate actors who have both ability as actors and ability to integrate their methods into the larger methods of the project. Very few actors know how to do this, or even care. They instead substitute what we as viewers call ""ensemble"" acting, which consists of bouncing off of each other like balls. That happens here, but this is Scott's project: he adds a dimension to this, the dimension of manipulating the dynamics of the actors. Meta-acting. His character manipulates everyone else; two of them (Fats and Fast, whose very names indicate permutations like poolballs) try to manipulate each other, and the method is manipulating balls. But then of course, the balls are them, their configuration affects the competition between Fast and Fats, and on up the chain determines how well Scott and his character play their games.Scott is an underappreciated actor, actually I mean to say that he is appreciated for his superb ability to do the ordinary rather than his risky attempts to do (as here) the extraordinary. I can this folded acting. Newman knew he was being manipulated as an actor and himself claims to not have learned folded acting until much later in ""The Verdict.""Piper is exploited as an actress just as her character is. She's clueless.Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 4: Worth watching.",The Hustler
601,The Hustler,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0074421/,"""The Hustler"" is steeped in the seedy atmosphere of smoke-filled pool halls in the ugly urban hinterland of America. The Ames Billiard Hall is funereal in feel.  When 'Fast Eddie' Felson walks in with Charlie, his manager, Charlie remarks, ""These tables are the slabs they lay the stiffs on.""  The film is about the talented men who perform, but equally about the talentless predators who exploit them.  The habitues of the pool hall cling to the shadows.  They wince when a blind is opened and sunlight gets in.  A new hustler enters, and these vultures gather silently on the margins.Eddie is the youngster hungry for glory.  He and Charlie pose as salesmen and Eddie feigns drunkenness, hooking the punters by repeating an almost-impossible shot.  For all the slickness of the con, Eddie is impatient for bigger things.  He wants to challenge Minnesota Fats, the best hustler in the land.Newman gets his name above the title, but this is a film with four exquisite pieces of acting.  Jackie Gleason as Minnesota, Piper Laurie as Sarah and George C Scott, playing Bert Gordon, turn in wonderful performances.Eddie matures as the story progresses.  He starts as a cheap chiseller, hustling ten bucks, but ambition carries him to Louisville and the world of the high rollers.  Sarah's love opens emotional dimensions in him which he previously lacked.  Bert Gordon confronts him with his own spiritual inadequacies, forcing him to understand himself.  Eddie is jejune in the first game against the Fat Man, but by the second meeting he is emotionally strong, and completely his own man.  He has made the spiritual journey from the whining ""everybody wants a piece of me"" to the inner knowledge that Sarah bequeathed him - that only those who give can truly live.Bert Gordon, with his dark glasses and hawkish features, is a creature of the night.  Loving the 'action' of a clash of talents, but lacking any talent of his own, Gordon is the predator on the sidelines.  Hearing of the new hustler's presence, Gordon arrives soundlessly and sits watching intently for hours.  His dark genius sees the weakness in every soul.  In the bar, when he and Eddie talk business, Gordon is foreshortened to look tiny alongside the talented youngster.  For all his money and sharp wits, Gordon will never be more than a parasite living off the ability of others. Finally, Eddie and Fats walk into the sunlight, heroes who have proved themselves.  Gordon remains perched on his gloomy barstool, a prisoner in his own dark kingdom.If Sarah is the vulnerable, physically-disabled woman who relies on drink too heavily, the victim of the men she encounters, she is also the heart of the movie.  She destroys Gordon's certainty and she shows Eddie the meaning of love.  Her tragedy is Eddie's salvation.  She and Eddie find each other in a deserted bus station in the dead hours.  They are both lost souls, Citizens of Hell.  She is the deformed girl with the empty life, and he is the emotional cripple with no resources of education or character to sustain him.  They cling to each other  as if shipwrecked.  When the seduction comes, Sarah hesitates.  She knows this will lead to suffering. ""Why me?"" she asks, then surrenders to her fate.The time when Eddie's hands are in plaster is Sarah's brief season of happiness.  She stops drinking and even makes progress with her writing. Somebody needs her, belongs completely to her.  It cannot last.
""I made you up, Eddie,"" Sarah tells him, and in a sense she did.  She imagined him to be loyal and stable.  On the night when the truth dawns, Sarah goes from feeling pretty in her new dress to being a rain-sodden wreck.  She is supplanted in Eddie's attention by the sinister Gordon, who asserts the new power-balance in the railroad dining-car.  The hotel suites are adjoining, and though Sarah closes all the doors, she can't keep Gordon out.  By Findlay's party, she has hit the bottle again.  The patterned dress which Eddie bought her, a symbol of her incarceration, has the shadow of the ballustrade projected onto it, seemingly magnifying her sense of ensnarement.Though Jackie Gleason does very little in this film, he dominates it. On screen for a fraction of the film's totality, and having neither great speeches nor grand gestures, he impresses by his sheer presence.  Stillness, self-containment and an ironic amusement make Minnesota Fats the perfect foil for the angry, ambitious Eddie.  In the final showdown, Fats' quiet poise outshines the grandstanding of the others.  Gleason conveys beautifully the fear at the core of this big dandy.  When Eddie has him in trouble, the Fat Man begins to lose his sartorial integrity as his confidence unravels.This contrast of stillness and motion is effective in the first meeting of the hustlers.  Fats and Gordon, who know what they are about, remain motionless and tranquil.  Eddie the incontinent wannabe gradually loses control of both mouth and limbs.  The film is rich in symbolic language. The cheap rooms which Eddie rents are mere boxes for hire, like the bus station locker which he lives out of.  When he and Sarah meet for the second time, the inevitability of their coupling is conveyed in a scene without words or gestures.  Eddie's plastercasts are manacles - without his hands, he is nothing.  A sumptuous restaurant and a happy couple are transformed when the brutal truth emerges.  The camera angle is reversed, and Eddie and Sarah are now separated by gaunt shelves of crockery.  The illusion has been shattered.  When Eddie sneaks out on the sleeping Sarah with the stake money in his hand, it is the betrayal of Charlie re-enacted.A marvellous film is enhanced by a superbly sleazy jazz score (Kenyon Hopkins) and the violence is all the more gut-wrenching for being suggested, rather than shown.Verdict - probably a masterpiece.",The Hustler
602,La Dolce Vita,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1638128/,"Long, episodic film by Federico Fellini about the conceits and facades of life: fame, intellect, sex, friendship, despair, innocence, etc.Marcello Mastroianni is perfect as the shallow tabloid reporter who joyfully follows around Rome a blonde movie star from Sweden (Anita Ekberg) as she prowls around the city's bars and bistros. He is also having an affair with a woman (Anouk Aimee) while his girl friend (Yvonne Furnaux) seems to be going nuts.But as Marcello moves through the city following the movie star, the miracle of the virgin, a few parties, etc. we see that his life is very empty because the things he reports on are meaningless drivel. We see that fame and fortune and the trappings of success are meaningless.Marcello starts to realize that the movie star is a vapid airhead, the miracles are a sham, and his friend's (who seemed quite happily married) ghastly murder and suicide show the futility of life itself.The Fellini themes are common to many of his films, but what makes La Dolce Vita so memorable are the cynical tone, the Nina Rota music, and the string of terrific visual images.The opening scene is of a helicopter hauling a gilded plaster statue through the air across Rome. The flying saint is a bizarre image but serves to set up the movies which is all about images and events that are never what they seem to be.Notable are the scenes of statuesque Ekberg in that terrific strapless black dress with the voluminous skirts as she swishes around dancing and eventually wading through a city fountain. The party scenes are also notable. The first because of the intolerable intellectuals who sits around and talk and talk but never do anything. The last party has the indelible image of Mastroianni ""riding"" a drunken blonde woman as though she were a horse. The final image of the giant dead fish is quite unsettling as it symbolizes their bloated lives.Fellini is brilliant in filling scenes with odd people as extras, usually hideously dressed or wearing ugly glasses. The ""gallery"" of people who inhabit the city is one of grotesques, vapid fashion slaves, the rich, hangers on, etc.A long film, but highly recommended and very memorable.",La Dolce Vita
603,La Dolce Vita,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4007546/,"Great artists are like prophets whether they mean it or not. Think of H G Wells and Ray Bradbury or Paddy Chayesfski for that matter. Here Federico Fellini warns us about the disenchantment of plenty. So, at the end, this scandalous film of 1960 is a morality tale. Marcello Mastroianni is superb, a beautiful exterior with an interior that is dying, slowly but surely. The term ""paparazzo"" was coined in this film. The hunters of the banal grew in numbers over the years but not in scope,
Anita Ekberg became a symbol of the sixties and who was she? A fantasy, impossible to reach. Real is his wife, the splendid Yvonne Fourneaux. Real is his father, played with heart breaking resignation by Annibale Ninchi or the suicide of his close friend, the intellectual played by Alain Cuny. La Dolce Vita is almost 58 years old and I imagine that the its message, like in most art, will live forever.",La Dolce Vita
604,Rio Bravo,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1414346/,"Despite its classic status, this is not one of my favorite Westerns. I have my reasons. First of all, it's not really a Western. It can be and has been transposed to just about any era, anywhere in the world. Next, the story is absurdly simple. You have a small group standing off a much larger group trying to get their comrade out of captivity. That's about it. There isn't a whole lot more. Finally, the actors camp it up something terrible. Now I don't hold with those who say John Wayne couldn't act. If you watch ""Red River"", ""The Searchers"", ""The Quiet Man"", ""True Grit"", ""Hondo"", and a number of others, you'll find an impressive body of work by a dedicated professional. Here, however, Wayne plays Wayne and nobody else. The same is true of just about everyone else in the cast with the exception of the great Walter Brennan, who brings dignity to his role. I am aware that many people really love this movie. I am aware that ""Rio Bravo"" is included in some critics' top ten lists of the best Westerns ever made. I have watched it over and over again to find out what I'm missing, what I can't see. I just can't get it. There is just too little plot and too much ham for my taste.",Rio Bravo
605,Anatomy of a Murder,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1071234/,"The sly old German, Preminger, proves a hard nut to crack today as in 1959 when the film was first issued. This is a denunciation of the trial-by-jury system, and apparently continues playing on today's viewers the same tricks it played its original ones. A gin-drinking, tough, cold blooded beast of an army veteran, beats his wife black when he catches her cheating with the local barman, shoots the offender and forces her to swear on the rosary (she's a guilt ridden Catholic because she's divorced, and clings eagerly to her creed's symbols) to lie to the authorities, claiming she's been raped by her lover, so her brute of a husband manages to obtain an ""exception"" as ""temporarily insane"" (an 1885 case is unearthed to sustain the claims of his defense) and get away with the murder. Which he does, helped by a former prosecutor (Stewart) whose place is been held by ""an inferior mind"" today and needs to prove to the others and himself he's not finished. Helped also by a judge whose lenience is established once he understands the defense attorney to be an equally passionate fisherman as he. Time and again the jury is advised to ""disregard"" what they have heard, whenever  and it is very often  the defense systematically overrules court procedure and creates impressions that favor the accused  indeed this is a recurrent instance during that long trial. Everybody (but the average viewer!) is from a certain point on quite sure that the decorated soldier (excellent Gazzara) is guilty as charged, that his wife (equally excellent Lee Remick) is a loose morality woman, indeed a charming little harlot, that the murder has been one of cold premeditation and everybody is lying. But the system is such that impressions carry the day. This is a masterpiece of concealed realities and guilty consciences. As the defense lawyer and his ""assistant"" (his crony, a sympathetic old drunkard, as keen for success as is Stewart's lawyer) bless and praise juries while waiting for the verdict, as Stewart's faithful and likable secretary longs for victory only because she needs to see her long overdue paycheck made out to her, from the fee her employer is due to collect, Preminger is going all out to denounce the fallibility of the system in the most understated and at the same time the most deafening manner. I am amazed so few seem to realize this and lay instead the (great) value of that masterly directed, played and photographed film only to it's faithful, humorous, well paced and exciting depiction of the trial. This is a definite masterpiece of irony and hidden contempt, a movie angry as it is soft spoken and caressing both the public's sensibilities and the system's watchdogs  apparently very stern during the late 50s.",Anatomy of a Murder

607,Cat on a Hot Tin Roof,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1111298/,"In ""Cat on a Hot Tin Roof,"" Newman is an ex-football player, trying to relive his college athletic glories Drinking and staggering, he attempts to jump hurdles, resulting in a painful injury that has him hobbling around on crutches during most of the film The role was certainly another demonstration of his widening range, for Brick is in many ways the antithesis of Ben Quick (""The Long, Hot Summer""). Although he too is cynical, cold and guilt-ridden, he manifests it by becoming moody, withdrawn, introverted In addition, whereas Ben was strong and decisive, causing and participating in events, Brick is weak and passive, largely reacting to events around him... And he's anything but ambitious: while his greedy brother and sister-in-law await Big Daddy's death so they can inherit his huge fortune and plantation, and while his wife Maggie (Elizabeth Taylor) urges him to fight for his share, he merely broods and drinks... An emotionally crippled, ""thirty-year-old boy,"" he refuses to face responsibility and truth, preferring to drown his memories in liquorNewman and Taylor enact striking contrasts in temperament: she is fiery, loud, animated, sensual; he is cold, quiet, immobile, dispassionate Brick and Maggie haven't been sleeping together, and she wants him desperately, but he keeps rejecting her advances As she talks, he replies with sarcasm, contempt and mostly indifference, speaking in a dreamy, monotonous manner, as if only half-there In conversations with her, as with Big Daddy (Burl Ives), he stares into space, or walks away (usually toward the liquor supply), turning his back on the other party and forcing the dialog to take place on separate planes All of this places him in a private world, where he hides his torment and anxiety beneath a mask of detachmentIf Newman is best at enacting Brick's unspoken thoughts and emotions, he's also effective in the more spirited moments, as when he screams at Maggie or Big Daddy, to prevent them from getting at the truth he wants kept buried But exactly what the ""truth"" is remains unclear In the play, Brick's fear of admitting a homosexual attachment led indirectly to his friend's death and explained his overall moodiness and passivity But because of Hollywood's moral code, director-scriptwriter Richard Brooks had to eliminate this, and the character's motivations are considerably weakened His hostility toward Maggieunderstandable in the playis especially confusing because it results from events that are unconvincingly outlinedWith the homosexuality cut out, Brick's dependence upon his friend is now explained by the failure of Big Daddy to provide strength and love, and this changed emphasis does make for exciting drama The film's key scenenot in the playis one in which Brick confronts his father with this painful truth As they sit in a cellar disarranged with the old man's useless antiques, he tells Big Daddy that love cannot be bought Newman moves powerfully from anguished looks to an eruption of emotion, smashing everything in sight, finally breaking down and crying: ""All I wanted was a father, not a boss ... I wanted you to love me."" Both are in painBig Daddy because of cancer, Brick because his crutch has (symbolically) been broken, and they need each other's he1p to get upstairs Therefore the film ultimately becomes another statement of father-son alienation, and their coming to terms with it, as in ""The Rack"" and ""Somebody Up There Likes Me,"" leads the characters to a new strength (and an upbeat ending not in the play).Despite its compromises, the film was still daring by 1958 standards, and was an enormous commercial success It received six Oscar nominations, including one for Newman as Best Actorhis first. Newman had developed, at last, a really impressive acting ability, and a distinctive screen image",Cat on a Hot Tin Roof
608,Sweet Smell of Success,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1110678/,"There are three reasons that movie fans should check this film out, if you haven't seen it yet:1 - Outstanding dialog. I can't recall a film in which I heard so many clever film-noir lines as this one. Almost everyone in the movie has a unique way of expressing their feelings. It makes the movie one that you want to go back and HEAR again. Clifford Odets and Ernest Lehman wrote the screenplay and deserve special recognition as well as the people below.2 - Fabulous acting, led by the two male leads: Tony Curtis and Burt Lancaster. Curtis is the star of the film with many more lines than anyone else, and many consider this to be his greatest acting achievement. I have no quarrel with that. It's one of the finest acting jobs I've ever witnessed by anyone. It's that good. Lancaster is memorable and plays to his strengths as a tough guy, not only with his physical presence but his tactless and cutting verbal assaults. He has the best and most brutal lines in the film.The minor characters in here, from the cop to the comedian to the cigarette girl to the young romantic couple are all top-notch.3 - The cinematography. A big name in the film business, James Wong Howe, more than lives up to his reputation. This is beautifully photographed and looks absolutely stunning on DVD. I have watched hundreds and hundreds of black-and-white films and this ranks with the best of them. He captured nighttime New York City as well as anybody ever has done.""Well,"" you might ask, ""if this movie is so great, why haven't I heard more about it?""Maybe because it never did well at the box office. It wasn't promoted a lot, from what I heard, and the storyline is not a pleasant one. Basically, this is about two immoral people who smear a nice guy so that it will ruin the romance between he and Lancaster's sister. Lancaster plays an absolutely ruthless newspaper columnist who makes and breaks careers and Curtis plays his slimy press-agent who will do anything to please his powerful boss, including doing the worst of his dirty work.Furrther details of the film can be read by many of the other fine reviewers here on this website, so no need to go into that.I am not one who generally likes films that feature mostly nasty people but this was done so well that it fascinates me every time. A final tip of the hat to director Alexander Mackendrick. Why he wasn't given more films to direct is a mystery to me. Highly-recommended.",N/A
609,The Killing,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4908157/,"No need to echo plaudits for this, one of the most finely crafted crime films in Hollywood annals. Instead, I want to pick up on some of movie's unusual aspects for its time period, the 1950's. As I recall, TK was the only film this young movie freak was captivated enough to see twice.Most atypical of the 50's is that for a crime film honest cops are hardly seen anywhere, except for security guards at the track, and have no role in cracking the case. No Dragnet here. In fact, it's a ditzy old lady and her purse-size doggie that ruins Hayden's get-away. That bit of delicious irony was not only compelling for that day but for this day too, which shows that even the grandest designs can be brought down in the most trivial manner. I suspect that's a big reason I paid money to watch a second time.Then too, the criminals are humanized in unusual fashion. That is, we understand why the gang members turn to crime-- except maybe for De Corsia's crooked cop which may have been too much for Kubrick to risk. Also, Sawyer's track attendant with the sick wife is especially poignant. In fact, it's hard not to root for the brilliant robbery plan, entrepreneurial as it is. The humanizing element here is in contrast to the criminal stereotypes of the time who presented hardly a touch of ambiguity.Then there's the sexual innuendo, masked, but present nevertheless. Flippen's gay designs on Hayden I'm sure went past most audiences of the time when such topics were forbidden on both big screens and little. It certainly went past my teenage grasp. But I salute Kubrick for sneaking it in at a time when the Hollywood production code was breaking down.And of course, there's the dramatic centerpiece-- wimpy Cook's doomed marriage to a heartless Windsor. I'm conjecturing a bit, but based on the elliptical dialog, I think Cook's basic problem, besides being wimpy, is chronic impotence. Given Windsor's overbearing manner, his difficulties would be understandable. So, to substitute for bedroom problems, Cook feels he must prove himself by getting rich by fair means or foul. Anyway, impotence was another forbidden topic even when it pivots the plot as in The Barefoot Contessa (1954).And lastly, only a flick like this would dare use such a zany character like Timothy Carey. After all, the 50's was the decade of glamor and convention, making him like an onion in the tulip patch. I only wish his role here were bigger, but he does add a distinctive kind of color, and would be an unforgettable oddity in Kubrick's successor film Paths of Glory (1958).All in all, I think these are some reasons the heist film separated itself from the 50's pack and, remains a classic to this day. At the same time, it shows Kubrick looking effectively ahead, as his career would prove, and not safely behind. Come to think of it, now that the wife's left the room, I think I'll give my DVD another look-see.",N/A
610,The Killing,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1178623/,"Director Stanley Kubrick is best known for ""2001: A Space Odyssey."" ""A Clockwork Orrange"" or ""The Shining"" but I always found this to be my favorite of his films. This is film noir at some of its best: a tight no-nonsense story with tragic consequences, some of the best film noir actors in the business and great cinematography, which looks even better on DVD.Sterling Hayden is the gang leader in this heist film and the big man was up to the task as he usually was in these kind of crime films. He wasn't as rough a character as he was in ""Asphalt Jungle,"" but his role reminded me of that film.What made this movie so appealing to me were four very interesting character actors: Elisha Cook Jr., Marie Windsor, Kola Kwariani and Ted de Corsia. Few people had those loser-type film noir characters down pat as well as the tough-talking Windsor and the meek and wimpy Cook. They played a husband-and-wife team here: that's film noir heaven!Kwariani plays a burley chess-playing wrestler who fights six cops at one time and Carey is a long-distance racist rifleman who talks through clenched-teeth and shoots a racehorse! As I said, some very interesting characters here. And, oh yeah.....for you over-55 readers, there's Vince Edwards, alias Dr. Ben Casey of TV fame, as a Windsor's young adulterer boyfriend trying to horn in on the money from the robbery.This film is full of surprises and always fun to watch.",N/A

612,The Night of the Hunter,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0055732/,"I still hear the lullaby singing sweetly in my head, like a hazy, haunting dream that won't go away.From the opening scene of the beautiful Lillian Gish and her children, watching over the world in a starry sky, this movie just sinks you into a mesmeric fairy tale land.  The camera takes us down in one sweeping move to a scene of children playing, a hot sunny day, and right to the feet of a murder victim.  And that sweet music turns on us like a twisted nightmare as the scene chases after a car speeding along a country road to find one of movies worst villains. Charles Laughton, in sadly his one and only stab at directing, created a masterpiece of horror with Night of the Hunter.   The moments of sugar coated sweetness only make this movie even more disturbing as you wonder how the two can inhabit the same world. Mitchum is terrifying.  More-so in a town full of simple folk ready to match him up with the local widow who needs a father for her lit'le n's. Its like he's walked into the middle of a Frank Capra movie and he's going to do what he wants to. This is not just a great horror movie,  but an artist achievement to rival Welles' Kane.  The river scene is one of many moments of pure visual splendor.  And that sound track just keeps drifting alone, as if trying to coax you into slumber, till the singing madman of your nightmares comes over the hill, relentless.

613,La Strada,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1274342/,"Memorable super outstanding film of a strongman's cruelty towards a woman that he has purchased.Anthony Quinn gives a memorable brilliant performance as the Zampano, the strongman. He shows animal-like instincts rarely seen on the screen.Giulietta Masina's performance as the simpleton is picture-perfect. She utterly evokes sympathy as a simpleton beyond belief. She may be simple but she is tragically looking for love to a strongman who thinks of it as nothing to hurt her in any way that he can.Richard Basehart, in an engaging performance, plays the fool of the circus. Yet, is he really this?The sadness seen on Masina's face is unbelievable. She cries out for compassion and for survival which fate has decided shall not be hers.Scenes of the tormented Quinn are beyond the realm of human understanding. When he returns after a year's absence only to learn of Masina's fate, he is wrought with destruction as a totally broken man.In 1954 the Motion Picture Academy would not allow actors in foreign films to be nominated in Acting categories. Had this been permitted, both Quinn and Masina would have certainly won Oscars.The film established Federica Fellini, Masina's husband, as a master director.A totally powerful film-never to be forgotten.",La Strada
614,La Strada,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0948016/,"La Strada brings two souls together to tell a story that ultimately displays humanity's finer aspects. The title gives a clue to the meaning of Fellini's masterpiece: The Way. The brute, Zampano, buys the urchin-like Gelsomina to be his traveling companion in his one-man carnival act. He is physically and emotionally cruel to her. Her longing to love and be loved, and her child-like, yet acute perception of life, and desire to live it, despite hardships, makes her the perfect complement to the selfish and despicable Zampano. Their unification affects each other. However, although Zampano's harshness adversely effects Gelsomina's life, it is her influence that will eventually, and more significantly, change him. This may sound like the familiar Beauty and the Beast fairy tale, but it is more than a love story. It is about love, but it isn't until the very end of the film that we realize it. More than love, it is about a man who gains insight and awareness because of love. It is his finale transformation that demonstrates both the frailty and vitality of the human condition. It overpoweringly suggests that the individual, no matter how depraved, is able to spiritually evolve. Every frame and scene in this masterpiece has purpose and meaning.",La Strada

The school belongs to Christina, but it's Michel who has the last word about everything. This penny pinching man insists in giving his students living at the boarding school the worst food money can buy. Michel is also a man who loves to slap his wife, and his mistress, Nicole Horner, who is a teacher at the school. When we first meet them, Nicole has a swollen eye and wears dark glasses to hide her shame. Obviously, everyone guesses what is really going on between Michel and Nicole, even his wife. Christina is aware of the extra-marital goings on between her husband and his mistress. A strong minded Nicole shows how she dominates the weaker Christine. Nicole, who is fed up with the situation convinces Christina something must be done. She sets things in motion to go to her home town during a brief vacation so that Christina and Nicole attract Michel to come after them as they have a plan of their own about how to deal with his abuses.The women's plan is to bring Michel's body back to the school and dump him in the murky swimming pool, where he would be discovered as drowned by accident, or perhaps his own suicide. When the pool is drained, there is no corpse. When one of Michel's suits is sent from a dry cleaner's the women are dumbfounded. When they go to investigate, the owner hands them a key for a nearby hotel room.Christina, who is a fragile woman with what appears to be a weak heart, feels guilty. When she reads in the newspaper about a drowning victim found on the Seine, she has to find out to see if it's her husband. Of course, the dead man is not Michel, which heightens the mystery. What Christina didn't count on is the retired inspector, Alfred Fichet, who watches her outside the viewing room at the morgue. This man will become the key figure to solving Michel's disappearance. ""Les Diaboliques"" was Clouzot's triumph because the suspense works until the end. He based his screen play in a novel by Pierre Boileau and Thomas Narcejar, who also served as the basis for ""Vertigo"". In fact, much has been said about the similarities between the two directors, but it is unfortunate because both men approached their work in different ways. Clouzot hints subtly at perhaps a lesbian relationship between Nicole and Christine as it appears both want to be rid of the horrible Michel.The acting is first rate. Simone Signoret, one of the best and most attractive actresses of her era, makes an earthy Nicole. She is calculating because there is a lot at stake. Vera Clouzot plays Christine as a bundle of nerves because of the gravity of her actions. Paul Meurisse is the evil Michel. Charles Vanet is the old inspector Fichet. Also in the cast, a young Michel Serrault, and the singer Johnny Holiday, who appears uncredited as one of the boys in the school.Henri Georges Clouzot was at the top of his craft and he clearly showed he was a master of suspense, bar none.",Les Diaboliques

617,Stalag 17,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1853925/,"This exciting POW drama has to be one of Wilder's best films. Like nearly all his work, it is extremely well-written, cynical and very witty. It also surprises how much (dark) humour Wilder managed to pull out this situation.William Holden (winner of the Best Actor Oscar, an interesting and worthy choice by the Academy) stars as Sefton, a Sergeant in a POW camp in Germany in WW2, who may or not be selling out his fellow soldiers in order to get a better deal from the Nazi's. Another thing that really impressed me was how Wilder sustained the suspense of the plot (Who is the traitor?) for so long. Wilder encourages us, nay, implores us through his silently roving camera and objectivity, to question everyone. And we do, from Sefton to ""Animal"" to Joey.This should be regarded as one of Wilder's best films. It's exceptional film-making. Wilder's films remain so fresh today because of his near-perfect scripts that have possess honesty instead of sentimentality, and his willingness to let his characters and story impress instead of burdening the film with showy technique. He also took on a range of different story lines. Bravo, Billy Wilder!",N/A
618,Roman Holiday,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3437624/,"After Trumbo we decided to watch one of the films of which Dalton Trumbo wrote the screenplay for. Roman Holiday is a 1953 American romantic comedy directed and produced by William Wyler. It stars Gregory Peck as a reporter and Audrey Hepburn as a royal princess out to see Rome on her own. Hepburn won an Academy Award for Best Actress for her performance; the screenplay and costume design also won. It was written by John Dighton and Dalton Trumbo, though with Trumbo on the Hollywood blacklist, he did not receive a credit; instead, Ian McLellan Hunter fronted for him. Trumbo's credit was reinstated when the film was released on DVD in 2003. On December 19, 2011, full credit for Trumbo's work was restored.The DVD sat on my shelf for the longest time and I am so glad I took it out to watch. The screenplay is subtle, filled with nuances that Hepburn and Peck teased them out beautifully. I can hardly detect an air of pretension and emotional manipulation. This is as romantic as it gets between a princess and an everyday man. The ending in the big hall really hits the spot. So much is left unsaid but yet what is said speaks volumes. It never betrays the tone of what the film sets out to be but yet my heart was beating with the full desire of wanting to see the relationship go a certain more familiar way. This is an amazing date movie with oodles of intelligence.",Roman Holiday

Princess Ann (Hepburn) escapes the confines of her rarefied royal existence for a day, to be rescued by a reporter, Joe Bradley (Gregory Peck).Bradley senses a scoop and seeks to inveigle the Princess into a story. However, this is a fairy tale, of the Princess and the commoner. Love blossoms, the beautiful Princess experiencing everyday things we might take for granted with a delight we cannot know. Sitting at a roadside café, getting a haircut, enjoying an ice cream, dancing on a riverboat. She soaks in these experiences in the company of her handsome saviour, not realising his intentions.It's beautifully done. Hepburn is radiant, refined, beautiful, enchanting - things she went on to display in many movies. However, she was at her most perfect here, as the beautiful Princess needing love and wanting happiness. Peck is an ideal foil. Tall, dark, and handsome, his only thought being the scoop placed before him, his ambition wilting in the face of his developing love for a Princess he can't hope to attain. Both are ably supported by Eddie Albert as Irving Radovich, Bradley's photographer colleague. Indeed, Albert is involved in many of the funniest scenes.It's a fairy tale, beautifully told. William Wyler makes the most of his location, showing us Rome in all it's splendour. The perfect backdrop to the perfect fairy tale.However, this film belongs to Audrey Hepburn.

Then the events start to unfold in a tale of a animal, the depending woman, and even her admirer, played by Karl Malden.  Absolutely acted to perfection by everyone (Liegh, Malden and Hunter got richly deserved Oscars), however it is the breakthrough by Brando in one of his best roles, that steals the show.  Crafted just like the play, except for one almost fatal flaw, the last scene of the movie is hollywooded up and if you read the play, that ending might be better for you.  Otherwise, a must see.

621,A Streetcar Named Desire,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0982328/,"Blanche Dubois arrives in the French Quarter of New Orleans suffering from a mental tiredness brought on by a series of financial problems that have ended in the family losing their plantation. She has come to stay with her sister, Stella and her husband Stanley Kowalski in their serviceable little apartment. The aggressive and animalistic Stanley immediately marks himself as the opposite of the feminine and refined Blanche and Stella finds herself pulled between the two of them. Stanley suspects all is not as it seems and begins to pry into Blanche's colourful past, even as Blanche spots a way out in the arms of the Mitch, a man captivated by her. However it doesn't take long before the cracks begin to show in the relationships and in Blanche herself.It almost goes without saying that the writing here is of top-notch quality. The story is a relatively simple character piece that can be summed up in a couple of sentences, however this would do a great injustice to the depth of development and the convincing manner in which the characters are all written and the story told. It is not so much the depth that some of the characters go to, but the complexity that is effortlessly written into them  we can see it writ large on them, but not to the point where it seems obvious or uninteresting. Blanche is of course the focus and she is a mess of neurosis barely hidden behind a front of respectability that clearly doesn't convince her anymore than it does Stanley. Mitch is also really well written  at first it is comic that he tries to be such a gentleman while having the brute just under the surface, but later his frustration is heavy on his face along with his anger. The overall story is surprisingly, well, ""seedy"" is the best word that comes to mind. It is in the gutter and no matter what Blanche wants to believe, that is where it stays and the film is right there the whole time.How Kazan managed it in the early fifties is beyond me, because even now the film is pretty graphic in its violence to women, subject matter and rippling sexuality across pictures and characters. It is a compelling story due to the characters and the manner in which they are delivered  Kazan's atmospheric direction really helps; the films feels humid and close, and he has done it all with a basic set and a camera. The lighting throughout is wonderful both in the general atmosphere but also specific touches such as the way Blanche manages to visibly age due to lighting changes when the film has slight chances of tone.Of course the main reason I keep coming back to this wonderful film is the actors, who take the opportunity and, in many cases, make it so that it is hard to see anyone else playing their roles. Leigh is perfect for the role and gets everything absolutely spot on; she is vulnerable yet self-seeking, confident yet needy, proper yet unstable. Even visually Leigh is convincing in terms of body language but also the fact that she looks the right mix of ages, looking beautiful one moment but worn and defeated the next  totally, totally deserved her Oscar. Brando made his name here and even now his performance is electrifying and memorable. He has his big scenes where he gets to play to the back row but he also has moments where he does nothing other than be a presence on screen; no matter what is going on we are watching him because we are as in awe and yet as afraid of his power as Blanche is herself. Together Leigh and Brando dominate the screen and whenever either of them are on screen it is hard to look away. As a result, Kim Hunter sort of gets lost in the background although her performance is still good. Karl Madden is great but again only holds a supporting role and deserved his Oscar for a convincing performance of a well-written character. Of course it is easier to give good performances with great material than with bad material but there have been enough versions of this play around for us to see how lesser actors can fail where this cast soared.Overall this is a great film that sees so many critical aspects all coming together as one final product. A superb play has undergone a great adaptation that has been seized upon a great cast who deliver a collection of performances that deserve all the praise heaped on them, all directed with a real sense of atmosphere that really delivers a seedy and erotic film both for its time and today. I cannot think of an excuse for people not having seen this film.",A Streetcar Named Desire
622,In a Lonely Place,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0042670/,"A scorching performance from Bogey makes this film a real classic, his Dixon Steele one of the great screen characters. In this more biting version of the plot of Hitchcock's suspense/comedy Suspicion, Bogart is a kind and loving screenwriter with a violent streak of temper waiting to break out and a taste for a drink or two, wooing Gloria Grahame's pretty young actress next door. The death of a young girlfriend of his hangs over him throughout the movie, as Graham at first believes him to be innocent, then later, having fallen for his charms, begins to suspect he may have had something to do with the girl's death after all, as his temper becomes more and more uncontrolled and frightening. The police circle around, making his nervous anger worse; the relationship begins to crumble into a mess of fear, lies and misunderstanding. Through all this Dixon Steele emerges as a great and brilliant creation, a highlight even in a career as illustrious as that of Bogart, a charming and witty man when happy, a black and vengeful man when roused to anger, a man of contradictions that only seems the more real, heroic, and ultimately tragic. Bogart's performance is brilliant, but the setting works well too, Grahame is great as the sassy girl he falls for, then frightens, the story chugs along at a fair lick, but allowing plenty of time for the many fun minor characters to develop well, and the script is a corker - wonderful stuff.",In a Lonely Place

What can one say about a comedy centred around a dapper, charming, likable, impoverished young English gentleman who is at the same time an utterly remorseless, ever-calculating killer who has no qualms about killing an entire line of relatives who all stand in his path to inherit the family fortune? On top of that, he all the while takes great care in preserving his demeanor and status as a gentleman; all the relatives he must eliminate are brought to life by the genius of Alec Guinness; and there's an executioner who takes pains to show proper respect to his social ""superior."" The dialogue, indeed pretty much all of the humour, is a shining example of ""British humour"" at its best. It is subtle, clever, dark, and full of irony and satire. It is pure, brilliant entertainment that doesn't stop. Comedy really can't get much better than this.",N/A
625,Rope,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0039028/,"Spellbinding.  It's about two (purportedly) gay men, Brandon Shaw (John Dall) and Phillip Morgan (Farley Granger) who strangle a friend to death for the thrill of it.  They then hide the body in a trunk just before a dinner party they have which include the victim's family and friends.  They also proceed to serve the food on the trunk containing his body.  They also invite a headmaster they had at school together--Rupert Cadell (James Stewart) a very cynical individual.  As the party progresses Cadell realizes something is very wrong--and is afraid he might be responsible in an indirect way.Absolutely fascinating.  Hitchcock's first color film was also shot in 10 minute takes--Hitch thought it might provide a seamless flow of narrative. After all this was adapted from a play.  I think it works very well--it's not distracting at all and the film does move very smoothly.  Also he purposedly had the color toned down--he didn't think bright Technicolor was appropriate for the subject matter.  Purportedly Dall, Granger and Stewart's characters were all gay.  It's never made clear but it DOES seem like Dall and Granger are lovers (and both were gay in real life) and the script was adapted by a gay man (Arthur Laurents). Also it's based the Leopold-Loeb murders in which two gay men killed a young boy for the thrill of it in the 1920s.  So there is a strong gay subtext in the film.Also there's plenty of black humor throughout.  After the murder there are lines like ""Knock 'em dead"", ""killing two birds with one stone"", ""I could strangle you"" and ""these hands will bring you great fame"".  They're actually quite funny and frightening at the same time.  With two exceptions all the acting is good.  The two bad performances are by Sir Cedric Hardwicke (he seems to have no idea what he's saying) and Farley Granger.  Actually Granger is so bad he provides some unintentional humor! The best acting is by Dall who is absolutely chilling and Joan Chandler (who Hitchcock kept tormenting on the set) as Janet Walker.  She has some great lines and gives her all to every one of them.  Best of all is Stewart--he doesn't pop up until the film is almost half over and he's incredible.  He plays a very cold, cynical intellectual--this is unlike anything he's played before.  His acting is very toned down (until the end) but you can see all his expressions through his eyes.  This is easily one of his best performances.  He hated making the film.  For the 10 minute takes Hitch had to design a set which could accomidate the huge cameras.  When the camera moved the set walls were designed to go flying up (off camera) so the crew could move from room to room.  It distracted Stewart a lot and he couldn't sleep nights.There's also the VERY impressive cyclorama background of NYC where we slowly see day turn into night.This is basically all talk but every single line is fascinating.  Stewart's lines especially are great and the philosophy described is intriguing.  And the gay subtext adds another layer to it--see the looks Dall and Granger exchange once in a while.  Actually Montgomery Clift was approached about playing Granger's role but turned it down.  He was gay too but wanted to keep it hidden and that role was just a bit too risky.All in all an absolutely fascinating picture.  A definite must-see!  It's short too (only 81 minutes).  Don't miss this one!",N/A
626,Rope,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0038938/,"This movie is always brushed aside as ""minor"", and ""an experiment that failed"", EVEN by Hitchcock himself. I can't let that mistaken judgment stand.I have seen it many times over the years and always found it moving and disturbing but never analyzed why it had this effect. On viewing it again tonight immediately after watching To Catch a Thief, I became aware that Rope remains brilliant whereas the other movie was merely a pretty and lightweight, average 50's period piece.The really strange thing is that Hitchcock's movies fall into certain distinct periods which have been written about at length (from early British to late Hollywood; from suspenseful dramas to macabre comedies), but this does not fit into any of them. It is a forties movie, like Saboteur, yet it is shot in colour so it looks like a much later film. To everyone, forties equals black and white. This is a stage play and takes place all in a one room set, but there is the remarkable effect of the huge window which shows the sun going down in real time over the course of the movie, over Manhattan buildings. This is of course done carefully with special lighting effects, but it gives the perfect illusion of the sun setting. It is just that there are fewer skyscrapers there than we would see today.Some of the slang is dated (but charming), and such elements as a cigarette case could never play a part in a movie made today, but even with these few period references it seems to be a very modern film. The subject matter was horrifying and shocking for 1948, but is rather less so now, as we are unfortunately used to seeing gore and mindless violence. The homosexual subtext would now be played overtly, but the way it is filmed gives it a more ominous atmosphere than movies which have everything spelled out.This is a movie filled with suspense from the first frame, without any extraneous footage. All the dialogue sounds genuine, not ""stagey"" as most plays generally do when made into movies. Examples: Glengarry Glen Ross, Oleanna, Boys in the Band etc. All good movies, but all scream out ""filmed stage play - actors emoting!"" whereas this movie simply draws you into its scenes of gradually dawning horror. I doubt if any Hitchcock film contains more pure tragedy and pathos, or a stronger moral message.It is a powerfully modern film and yet it is 52 years old.  Even the dinner party repartee is filled with wry comments that would not be out of place at a dinner party today - about such topics as the  astrological signs of movie stars.Yet under the witty dialogue is an undertone of tragic irony as the two hosts  play an elaborate and secret prank on their guests, simply for their own smug satisfaction.But it isn't simply the two hosts being in on it together; they are at odds, they bicker, and we are kept on edge because (as Hitchcock wants us to) we are forced to empathize with them to a degree, as well as hating them; we are fascinated by their quirks, played out in subtle nervousness. In taking us into the minds of the criminals as well as the minds of the innocent bystanders, we are left in torment for the horrifying state of humanity, until finally we are forced to take sides.There are so many brilliant touches in this movie that I can only list a few (without giving anything away). Jimmy Stewart idly setting the metronome in motion as Farley Granger plays the piano, making him play faster and faster while he questions him.  The preoccupied worrying of Sir Cedric Hardwicke as he looks out the window hoping to see his son, who is late, as the others chatter; the gradual coming together of the estranged couple who were hostile about each other's presence at the beginning; the unbearable tension as the plates and candles are being cleared away by the housekeeper while the guests and hosts are heard conversing off camera.The devastation in Jimmy Stewart's face as he realizes that his careless armchair philosophy has fed the imagination of two unstable minds and therefore he too is guilty.I can't say enough good about this film. It is underappreciated, never on any list of Hitchcock's greatest, but the time is long overdue for it to be appreciated as a masterpiece of suspense and art.It has none of the irritating Hollywood production glossiness of otherwise great movies such as Vertigo and North by Northwest, none of the blatant psychological mood shots of films such as Marnie. It doesn't have the simplistic filmmaking style of the forties and yet it springs from that era, not fitting in with anything else from the period, decades ahead of its time.",Rope
627,Out of the Past,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1133365/,"I don't like shoving films into a genre, mainly because a good film won't fit neatly into any one category. On the other hand, such genre groups are handy for general discussion and making ""best of"" lists, and so here I am sticking films in categories despite myself.That said, there's not much film noir that stands up to OUT OF THE PAST. THE THIRD MAN, DOUBLE INDEMNITY, THE SWEET SMELL OF SUCCESS and SUNSET BLVD. come quickly to mind. TOUCH OF EVIL, THE BIG SLEEP and THE SET-UP (even though it's a boxing movie) as well. It's a short list, and OOTP is right up there for me.One reason is a superior plot thread. I actually found myself thinking ""where is this going?"" instead of ""oh, please don't go there"". Another reason is Robert Mitchum's outstanding performance. But really, there's not much to criticize here.As it's not the first title coming to mind when one usually mentions the genre, I'll have to put the overly used phrase ""don't miss this"" in here, as any fan of film noir - or simply good movies - should make sure to see it. Unless you're one of those stuck on color film and think L.A. CONFIDENTIAL is noir, you're bound to like it.",Out of the Past
628,Brief Encounter,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2015426/,"I have just seen ""Brief Encounter"" for the first time and was not only moved by it but also struck by the brilliance of how the cinematography helped tell the story of how hemmed in Laura & Alec are. It's not just how the train station--the refreshments room, the underground passage, and the platform in the opening shot--is used to create the sense of confinement but also the way that the whole film is shot in closeup. Even when Laura & Alec make their escapes to the country, the camera never pulls back to give you a panorama that might suggest that, at least for a few brief moments, they are free. Another effect of this technique is that not only do you feel how crowded Laura is by people like the silly acquaintance she runs into at the train station but you also virtually never see Laura & Fred in the same frame (until the very last shot, of course), which helps to portray her feeling of isolation. Then there are the shadows in the underground passage in the train station!--well, one could go on and on. Great cinematic storytelling.",Brief Encounter
629,Laura,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1444337/,"Laura Hunt has been murdered in a most grisly way, a shotgun blast to the face as she answered her apartment door. Dana Andrews as Detective Mark McPherson is assigned to the case and he's got a good list of suspects to work from in this up close and personal murder.Laura Hunt hung out with some real characters. Dana Andrews has a good group to choose from. There's Vincent Price who was to marry Laura, a worthless playboy who spends his life as a permanent party guest. There's Clifton Webb as the epicene critic and noted wit who was a kind of sponsor for Laura into society. There's Judith Anderson as Laura's sophisticated aunt who has a yen for Price. There's even Dorothy Adams as Bessie, Laura's lesbian maid who is carrying a titanic torch for her ex-employer.Andrews very patiently and methodically goes through the suspects. In his way he's as officious and annoying as Lieutenant Columbo on television. But he does get to the truth. Of course there's one very big surprise for him during the course of the investigation.Gene Tierney is Laura and she was a beauty in her day. Man or woman, who wouldn't be crushing out on her. This film was the first one that got Dana Andrews any real notice from the critics. And of course Clifton Webb made a screen debut in this after a long career on Broadway. Webb got an Oscar nomination for his role of Waldo Lydecker as a Best Supporting Actor, but lost to Barry Fitzgerald for Going My Way.David Raksin's musical theme for this film is one of the great ones ever done for the cinema. So popular did it prove that Johnny Mercer wrote a lyric for it after the film came out. At the time people like Frank Sinatra and Dick Haymes and a host of others rushed to record it. I guess you could classify Laura as a kind of sophisticated noir police drama. It's dialog will leave you begging for more. It's not much in the way of mystery because about a third of the way through you will realize at the same time Andrews does who the murderer is, maybe even before Andrews does. That doesn't matter though because Laura is entertaining every step of the way.",Laura
630,Laura,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0030741/,"One of the best suspense films of the 1940s, ""Laura"" is loaded with elegant sophistication, witty dialogue, unscrupulous characters, and romantic obsession, all wrapped in hauntingly beautiful music.Lovely Gene Tierney is Laura; the young advertising executive allegedly murdered at the front door of her apartment. Dana Andrews is well cast as Mark MacPherson, the handsome, no nonsense detective assigned to unravel the case.Clifton Webb is superb as Waldo Lydecker, Laura's mentor and an egocentric, effeminate newspaper columnist who has made a career of eliminating Laura's prospective suitors. Lydecker detests Shelby Carpenter (Vincent Price), a southern playboy to whom Laura is engaged. Anne Treadwell (Judith Anderson) is Laura's aunt who, incidentally, is in love with Carpenter herself.As MacPherson sorts through the motives and alibis, he finds Laura too bewitches him. In one of the most memorable movie scenes of all time, Dana Andrews gives an intense performance of a man driven to distraction by the story of Laura, her letters, private diary, perfume, and hauntingly lovely portrait above the fireplace. Clearly agitated, he takes a drink as he sits in a chair beneath Laura's portrait. He falls asleep, and the audience is left wondering if his dreams of Laura are coming true, as she appears through the doorway. He awakens and rises from the chair, his soul shaken by the sight of Laura alive.This intriguing story, combined with Clifton Webb's biting quips, Gene Tierney's beauty and elegance, Dana Andrews' intensity and dark good looks, and Vincent Price's sense of humor, makes this film immensely watchable again and again.",Laura
631,The Best Years of Our Lives,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3121955/,"Not seldom have we seen veterans returning from wars in movies and certain assumptions are likely, but THE BEST YEARS OF OUR LIVES occurs to be an exceptionally memorable treatment of the theme. Bosley Crowther in New York Times, soon after the premiere of William Wyler's gripping work, pointed out accurately that the film ""visions the overflowing humors and the curious pathos of such returns, and it honestly and sensitively images the terrible loneliness of the man who has been hurt."" One of the major strengths of this film, therefore, does not lie in entertainment (though it does not lack it whatsoever) or any sort of heroic deeds worn in glorified patriotism (something that many movies of the time did not resist), but in the very empathy it employs to the theme and the characters. William Wyler speaks to the generation with clarity and modesty derived from his very experience with the men of Air Forces. Roger Ebert develops the thought labeling the central theme as ""sobering at the problems veterans faced."" He adds that ""Wyler doesn't pump in superfluous drama"" but actually IS with his characters and with/for his audiences. As a result, the story does not resort to the specific time of history but concludes in a rather universal, timeless insight into psychological and moral aspects of those troublesome torments and alienation therein endured. Ebert explains the fact why the movie so wonderfully passed a test of time with three adjectives applied to it: ""lean, direct, honest."" Let me highlight those features from the standpoint of the three veterans herein depicted.The main cast do not only come from various backgrounds, do not only portray different personalities with common experience yet diverse backgrounds but truly surprise us at multiple levels. All of them truly deservedly credit.FREDRIC MARCH, a very famous actor at the time, does a splendid job as sergeant Al Stephenson coming back home to his wife Milly (played with bravura and charm by Myrna Loy) and two kids, a daughter Peggy (played with subtlety by Teresa Wright) and a son Rob (Michael Hall). He is 'lean, direct and honest' in both merry-go-round scenes and serious moments but most captivating at the very adjustment to the family after the years of absence. The terrific ability to balance the hilarious with the serious is something that makes March's performance deserve particular attention. Although he has come back from war, much is at war within him...DANA ANDREWS as a former bombardier Fred Derry is a totally different character to analyze and perceive in the very context of pre-war vs. post-war reality - something many viewers of the time could identify with and most viewers of our time can fully understand. His destiny is shaped in direction towards Al's family (he is in love with Peggy) and yet, distorted by the haunting past and wrong choices. Here, who calls our attention is his wife Marie (Virginia Mayo), a conceited, vain woman occupied with what one looks like rather than bothering to consider what one feels. Andrews is given much freedom on the screen to develop the character on a great scale for the time. He does well. But the most intriguing and perhaps the most identifiable character among them is...HAROLD RUSSELL as Homer Parrish, a sailor most hurt by the war. His artificial hands, steel hooks have become almost a symbol of the movie's most powerful anti-war aspect, and, at the same time, the reason why the story may be called ""food for quiet and humanizing thought"" (Crowther). His character moves us most and leaves us almost reflective because it embodies honesty. Homer Parrish is a living statement that evokes the indifference and arrogance of war. He is in love with Wilma (Cathy O'Donnell) but he has to confront the reality the war experience has given to him. He is no longer the way he dreamed to be. Yet, the awareness of being loved helps him go on. Consider the bedroom scene with Wilma and the genuine tears of joy at having heard she loves him. Deservedly Mr Russell got the Oscar for the role and there is no question about one thing: such a screen achievement may be considered one among the very best roles of one's life. In this character lies quiet, subtle, captivating heroism.Among the female characters, great performances are delivered by Myrna Loy as Al's wife whose acting Crowther labels as ""charmingly reticent"" and Teresa Wright as Peggy who highlights trustworthy enthusiasm and youthfullness in difficult times. Virginia Mayo's ""brassy and brutal"" (Crowther) depiction also bears watching.In all this achievement, kudos to cinematographer Gregg Toland who employs high contrast lighting with terrific visual resonance added to the the whole story and builds the scenes upon exceptional clarity. Along with the obvious contribution of the director William Wyler, no less appreciation should go to the screenplay by Robert E. Sherwood for the perfectly framed plot(s).THE BEST YEARS OF OUR LIVES may undeniably be considered as one among the best films of our lives, an intense emotional link between the characters on screen and viewers where genuine feelings conquer heroic victories.",The Best Years of Our Lives
632,The Best Years of Our Lives,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0033656/,"I first saw this film (one of my top ten favorites) in 1995 on the big screen, as part of the commemorations for the 50th anniversary of the end of WWII. It had an impact that was so strong that it's never left me--I've seen it many times since, and with each viewing the film seems to reveal new artistic richness and spiritual depth.William Wyler's direction is breathtaking.  One of the most moving scenes occurs early on in the film, when Homer, the young disabled Navy veteran, arrives at his family home and stands for a moment on the front lawn.  For that one second there is an exquisite stillness that communicates a depth of emotion that can't be expressed physically.  Then, just as the tension becomes almost unbearable, Homer's little sister Louella comes to the front door and runs out to greet him.  In a similar way, the scene where Al Stephenson comes home to his wife and children is so finely directed you can almost feel that you're in the apartment with them--that it's your husband or father come home to you from the war--and you're experiencing the sheer elation of their physical nearness.This aspect of the film--its portrayal of the joys and hardships of post-war readjustment and the veterans' experience--is what makes it so enlightening, honest and powerful.  As a young woman, I have never experienced wartime or had my father, brothers or friends go off to fight. The film moves swiftly but seamlessly from the initial joy of homecoming and reunion to the problems, anxieties and humiliations that the three veterans encounter as they attempt to build a new life for themselves and their families.
I found it interesting how the film tries to give a picture of the different socio-economic backgrounds of the three men, and show the emergence of an affluent, market-driven economy.  While this in itself is not bad, different episodes in the film show how this economic approach can conflict sharply at times with enduring human values such as integrity and justice.  Al's dealings with the young veteran Mr Novak, who comes to him for a service loan to buy a farm, and his later (slightly tipsy) speech to a business gathering show this.  Al declares at the end of his speech that when the bank lends money to poor veterans it will be a financial gamble but ""we'll be gambling on the future of this country"".The film's interweaving of the characters and their struggles never falters and is deeply satisfying.  Even as Al and Milly, Homer and Wilma gradually move towards a happy resolution of their difficulties this positive strand of the film is counter-balanced by the focus on Fred, the courageous Air Force captain who, in the eyes of the commercial world is ""unqualified"", suitable only for a job at a soda fountain, and in the eyes of his war bride, Marie, is only wonderful when he's dressed up in his officer's uniform.  Fred's situation seems only to deteriorate and at one point in the film, after he farewells his elderly father to leave town and look for work, the father finds the citations for Fred's medals and sits down to read them. As he reads the words describing Fred's bravery and dedication to duty while he was terribly wounded in his aircraft, Pat Derry's voice nearly breaks with pride and love for his son.  The film beautifully juxtaposes Fred's unselfish conduct and willingness to make the ultimate sacrifice with the cold indifference of a country in peacetime that does not want him and seemingly has no place for him.The actors are uniformly impressive and really make their characters come alive.  Dana Andrews is especially outstanding together with two young actors making their debut, Harold Russell and Cathy O'Donnell, as Homer and Wilma.  Personally, I loved Homer and Wilma's story the best among those of all the characters,and the resolution is a simple, sensitively shot scene that lifts the whole film to a new point of happiness, gratitude and release.  Both Cathy O'Donnell and Teresa Wright are lovely, gifted actresses with a slightly understated style, that is perfectly suited to the film's restrained but powerful tenor.  This is demonstrated especially well in the tense scene where Wilma tries to talk to Homer in the shed, and in the scene where Peggy confides her heartache to her parents.One feature that adds significantly to the film's quality is Hugo Friedhofer's score.  The music is remarkably fresh and undated, has a strong, classic sound, and is poignant without being too romantic or sentimental (a flaw often found in other 1940s film scores).The producer, Samuel Goldwyn, reportedly said of this film: ""I don't care if it doesn't make a nickel...I just want every man, woman and child in America to see it"".  Although I'm not American (I am Australian) I found this film, with its universal human themes and its portrayal of post-war readjustment, speaks to anyone who shares in this heritage of WWII.  Tell others about this film--it is breathtaking, beautiful and brave.  See it and remember.",N/A
633,Arsenic and Old Lace,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1113757/,"A presumably sane young drama critic (Cary Grant) visits the home of his two elderly aunts. Upon arrival, he finds that his two dear, sweet, lovable aunts have embarked on what they see as their mission of mercy ... killing lonely old men, by giving them arsenic-laced wine. Our sane young drama critic soon learns that insanity runs in the family.Five years ago, the American Film Institute selected America's 100 funniest movies. ""Arsenic And Old Lace"" (1944) came in at Number 30. And that's not surprising. A lot of people enjoy this dark, screwball comedy, with its slapstick, its fast pace, its sharp dialogue, and its engaging characters. A lot of viewers like it simply because of Cary Grant.The film's underlying premise is really great. And I must confess that Aunt Abby (Josephine Hull) and Aunt Martha (Jean Adair) are cute and entertaining. (Interestingly, the film portrays them as usually together and almost always in agreement with each other. It's like they function as a single entity). And the other denizen of the house, Uncle Teddy (John Alexander) is also a hoot.But I'm not a big fan of Cary Grant. His performance here is exaggerated. His hyper and jerky behavior is distracting and grating. The plot gets ever sillier as it moves along, and downright tedious toward the end. Lastly, I have never cared much for films that are so top heavy with dialogue.The best part of the film is the cinematography. Most of the scenes take place in a big living room, at times with lights out. The B&W lighting is very stark with high contrast, which renders a suitably sinister atmosphere.""Arsenic ..."" is not my cup of tea. But, for viewers who like talky stage plays with an accent on macabre humor, this film is a fine choice. Could I interest you in a glass of elderberry wine, perhaps?",Arsenic and Old Lace
634,The Maltese Falcon,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0024749/,"""The Maltese Falcon"", scripted and directed by Hollywood first-timer John Huston (from Dashiell Hammett's novel), would go on to become an American film classic.  Humphrey Bogart chews the scenery in his star-making turn as acid-tongued private eye Sam Spade, whose association with the beautiful and aloof Brigid O'Shaughnessy (Mary Astor), neurotic Joel Cairo (Peter Lorre), and morbidly obese Kasper Gutman (Sydney Greenstreet, in his Oscar-nominated screen debut) over the recovery of the title object, sets in motion a movie experience that is as much crackling as it is dazzling.  While much of the action and dialogue is considerably dated by modern standards, the film's essential power to mystify and entrance remains undiminished despite its age.  While this was the third adaptation of Hammett's story (the first was made in 1931 and the second was ""Satan Met a Lady"" (1936)), this is also the best remembered and most praised, due largely in part to Bogart's seemingly effortless portrayal of the tough but softhearted, world-weary hero. Mary Astor and Lee Patrick were, respectively, the definitive femme fatale and girl Friday, and the villianous roles of Cairo, Gutman and Wilmer (Elisha Cook Jr.) were equally remarkable.  What may not be wholly obvious is the fact that these three men have homosexual tendencies (as given in the novel), but just look at what's given: Cairo's delicate speech and manner, Wilmer's questionable quick tempered attitude towards Spade (could this be covering up the fact that he finds Spade attractive?) and Gutman's clutching of Spade's arm when Sam arrives at his hotel room.  A polished film noir that gave rise to Bogart's mounting popularity.  (Sidenote: The character of Sam Spade was originally offered to George Raft, who turned it down. Raft also turned down ""Casablanca"" (1942), ""High Sierra"" (1941) and William Wyler's ""Dead End"" (1937), all of which went to Bogart and helped to boost his star status.  Bogart had Raft to thank for his enduring popularity.) A must-see masterpiece.  ****",The Maltese Falcon

Socialism/Communism was seen as an Alternative to the Punishing Poverty and Vanishing Opportunities by some and a Threat to Capitalism by the Capitalists.This is a Solid Background to the Story but Not the Backbone.

636,The Grapes of Wrath,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1226555/,"This movie is so real..at least to this person, who lived these things that happened in the movie. I will tell a short version of my personal life to let you know how it affected me from my own experience of growing up in the ThirtiesI think their must have been more then one car because ours was full of stuff in the back seat, clear up almost to the roof. Frankie, Bill and me (my brothers) all was on top of the stuff in the back seat, had to stay lying down was not enough room to set up. What I remember most about the trip was it was awful hot when we went through Arizona and we had not much water, the water we had was in a canvas bag, hooked to the front bumper to help keep it cool. We did not get much because dad was saving it for the car when the car got to hot. Mom told us to suck on pebbles, and we did. It was a bad time every where. No jobs or anyway to make any money. We were going to California because their was suppose to be some picking work their, after we got to California we saw miles of potatoes all loose piled up high my guess would be about six feet high, they had put lime or something that looked like lime it was a white powder to keep people from taking them to eat.We found a place to pick plums that they used to make prunes and we lived in a Quonset hut made of corrugated metal setting on a concrete slab. The public toilets were near were we stayed, Joe and his wife (Family friends)had their own Hutthis was the time that dad & Joe would sell tickets for people to watch them box each other in a ring at the recreation hall on the property. Also they joined a baseball team and played baseball, dad played left field. We got to watch them play for free.Seems like Frankie and I played together a lot don't think Bill did because he was still a baby his self, Doris and Dorothy (my sisters) was still crawling so Bill could not have been very old at that time. Frank & I would go pick up plums off the ground and we would bring them home, Doris and Dorothy would set in the box and eat them. You can guess what they would look like when mom and dad got home, their was no air condition back then so they would take a hose and squirt water on the tin Quonset hut to try and cool it off some, I know when we went west we looked like those grapes of wrath folks in the movie.That area was the first time I ever saw a frog walk, it was to hot for them to hop, when they tried to hop their bellies would touch the ground ( gravel) and would burn them, any way that's what we thought at that time. I saw the movie of Grapes of wrath a long time ago, and I remember it so well, I cried most of the time it was on because it reminded me of the hard time we all had back then, I was born in Oklahoma and it was just a terrible time in the late thirties I would love to see the movie again, its to me a history of my family, I am 71 1/2 years old now and still remember it very clearly.Gene McDaniel",The Grapes of Wrath

When there, she first discovers her home has crushed the Wicked Witch of the East to death and the area of Oz she has landed in is Munchkin Land. After a visit from the Good Witch of the North, some songs with the munchkins and an unpleasant visit from the Wicked Witch of the West, she starts to make her way along the Yellow Brick Road to the Emarald City to visit the Wizard himself who can get her back home to Kansas. On the way, she meets up with the Scarecrow, Tin Man and Cowardly Lion and they eventually end up at the Emarald City. Before eventually meeting the Wizard, she is kidnapped by the Wicked Witch of the West's strange monkey-bat creature slaves and locked up in her castle but is rescued and the Witch disintegrates when some water is thrown over her. Dorothy then gets to see the Wizard, who gives the Scarecrow his brain, the Tin Man his heart and the Cowardly Lion his courage. The Wizard turns out to be a Kansas person as well but his balloon is accidentally released and Dorothy misses out on returning home with him. She returns home by saying ""There's No Place Like Home"" but all this turns out to be a dream at the end.The best song in the movie has to be ""Somewhere Over the Rainbow"", which Dorothy sings before she gets to Oz.Now to the excellent cast. Judy Garland plays her best role as Dorothy and is joined by Frank Morgan who has five roles, Burt Lahr, Ray Bolger, Jack Haley and an excellent performance from Margaret Hamilton as the Wicked Witch of the West.This movie is an excellent way to spend part of an afternoon, not just at Christmas when most TV channels screen it.

638,The Rules of the Game,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5713348/,"Renoir made a tight little romantic, or rather anti-romantic, comedy. And an angst-ridden, oversensitive, pre-WW2 French Bourgeosie, afraid of its own shadow, saw their worst character flaws fully illuminated exaggerated and satirized. Renoir, being an extremely smart man with keen observational skills and an open mind, simple condensed what he saw into a brilliant, multilinear film and poked fun at himself and each of the ludicrous but oh so human characters he invented. Misinterpreting the film as an attack on upper middle class culture of mid-20th century France, the film was very severely criticized, banned, and, inevitably, recognized as a masterpiece. How French.Renoir's remarkably light character study of the pre-World War II French upper class entertainingly and humorously lampoons Western ideas of liberty, gentility, idleness and - the big game itself - love. Love, in this film doesn't REALLY have any fixed rules and is shown to consist of everything from a hormonal imbalance to self-loathing and apathetic contempt to an emotion of such power and purity that it could legitimately require the ultimate sacrifice. The concept of liberty, which is sort of an understated backdrop in this film, could be poignantly mistaken for decadence and self-indulgence. And as one might predict, only the least decadent characters (the servants) appear to have goals and some semblance of self-concepts.Renoir's masterfully written and directed piece was filmed and is set in a time where the vestiges of pre-capitalist ""high culture"" still had a strong influence on social mobility in France, so 21st century globalists in particular may find the stark and very overtly illusory distinctions between his lordship, his Austrian noblewoman wife and his servants to be quaint but perhaps a little alien. Set against the medium of decadence and directionlessness manifested in spurious and meaningless love/lust/sex/desire the film presents us with a cabaret of likable yet mostly despicable and extremely well-acted archetypes.La Règle du Jeu presents a tangled web of relationships of every kind set against a social gathering at a country manor presided over by Marcel Dalio's sympathetic (and pathetic) but rather hollow lordship and his exotic lady, an Austrian noble played by Nora Gregor. Renoir himself plays the older Octave, who appears to be the only person at the party who has set himself out of the ""the game"" - friend to all lover of none. But even this laudable status inevitably breaks down in the tumult of rampaging aimlessness concentrated by the big party. The serving staff, though perhaps more honest and direct about themselves, are an obliquely angled mirror of the bourgeouis house guests in virtually every way. A few cross-class relationships will stick with you and are worth paying special attention to - the extremely condescending ones between the lord and his new domestic (memorably played by Julien Carette) and the lady and her chambermaid (Paulette Dubost) come to mind. In both cases, the servants have the upper hand in nearly every way, but they earn that position by subtly disguising their own wills as sound decision making by their ""superiors"".La Règle du Jeu is a beautiful film. The audience is bombarded with continuous action, a very attractive and memorable cast that is in constant motion, gorgeous settings, and extremely well-choreographed and often very long continuous shots in which three or four plots are introduced, climax and close in the space of a few minutes. It deserves its reputation as a great film.",La Règle du Jeu
639,The Rules of the Game,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1002598/,"Jean Renoir said that this was not intended to be a social commentary, and whether he truly intended it to be (he referred to it as, ""An exact description of the bourgeoisie of our time."") or not, it is hard to dismiss that it hit close to home. So offended were the masses that the picture was banned. It is said that behind every joke there is truth, and whether this was intended to be a joke or not, Renoir still found truth. One could argue the director's intentions all day, but one matter that cannot be disputed is that this film is extraordinary! As a handful of French men and women converge on a château for a hunting expedition, their love affairs clash with their obligations to society's game. For instance, one cannot leave one's lover to be with another until he has confessed his adultery to her. Attempts to leave with another man's wife are particularly difficult, as well, unless the other man has a mistress of his own. These are but a few rules of the game. The old are for the old, the young are for the young. Members of one social order are forbidden to see members from another, and so on. Combine these rules with a tangled web of countless love affairs between a handful of people, and you can see the madness that erupts during the course of this movie. The parts are all played well, but it is the writing and directing of Renoir that makes the film the masterpiece that it is. Keeping all of these sordid affairs in order is an achievement in its own right, but Renoir moves his pieces all over the board like a skilled chess player, achieving his goal while never forgetting the rules of the game!",N/A
640,The Thin Man,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2164415/,"This is one of my favorite movies from any decade. William Powell and Myrna Loy have such chemistry together and their expressions during their verbal sparrings are priceless. Under different circumstances it might be easy to dislike Nick and Nora Charles - they are the idle rich who spend their time overindulging in alcohol, having loud parties, and destroying their own property with air rifles at a time (1934) when much of America was starving through the worst part of the Great Depression. On top of that, Nick makes no secret of how appealing his wife's money is to him. However, the intricate plot, the couple's clever dialogue, and their chemistry draw you in and make their world even seem somewhat normal.The Thin Man refers to Clyde Wynant, a somewhat absent-minded inventor, the chief suspect in what turns out to be three murders, and someone who only actually appears in the first 15 minutes of the film, never to be seen afterwards.The Charles' get caught up in the mystery of Wynant's disappearance because his daughter Dorothy (Maureen O'Sullivan) is an old friend of Nick's and asks Nick for his help. Wynant has told his daughter that he is going off somewhere secret to work on an invention so that nobody can steal it from him, but promises he will be back before Christmas so he can be present at her wedding. However, Wynant has never resurfaced and nobody has heard from him. Nick initially has no interest in continuing his former occupation of detective - he is much more interested in having a good time - until a series of circumstances and his own wife's urging draw him into the mystery and back into his role as private detective.The film is full of unsavory yet interesting characters. Wynant's family is truly dysfunctional. His son is an oddball bookworm obsessed with abnormal psychology, his ex-wife has remarried a gigolo who appears to be hiding a questionable past and finds the idea of working for a living insulting, and Wynant's girlfriend is a very greedy and aging ex-flapper who steps out on Wynant with other men whenever she thinks he isn't noticing. The only virtuous characters in the film seem to be Wynant's daughter and her fiancé. In short, there is no shortage of possible suspects and worthy victims. Even the police in the film are unappealing - they are very good at getting rough with people and performing illegal searches, but not very quick on finding clues or making even obvious deductions. The constantly semi-inebriated Nick Charles has no problem running circles around them and turns out to be both brave and brilliant in his role as sleuth.I recommend this film to anyone who likes a good murder mystery laced with a bit of dark comedy.",The Thin Man
641,All Quiet on the Western Front,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1780220/,"There were some anti-war movies before this one but none of them hit the mark- and made its point so well such as this one. It's still one of most powerful movies ever made, out of any genre or time period. And not just that, the movie is also really among the best ever made.The movie concentrates on a group of German soldiers during WW I, of which most of them are still just only school kids in the beginning. First we see how the very young boys are being reprogrammed as soldiers. Then we see how they all are slowly going crazy, due to the madness of war. After that the movie shows the aftereffects of war, on those who fought in it. From the hospital till their leave back home, this movie shows and tells it all. We further more see them dealing with all kinds of problems; the lack of food, rats, the death and see them discuss the point of war. Or like Paul Bäumer sums up in the movie; ""We live in the trenches out there. We fight. We try not to be killed, but sometimes we are. That's all.""It's not hard to see that this movie influenced many other later war/anti-war movies, even till this present day, with ""Full Metal Jacket"" and ""Starship Troopers"" as the most obvious and best known examples.For its time period this was also a very graphic movie, although no way people will now be shocked by any of the 'gore' within this movie. Nevertheless the movie its violence and disturbing moments still haven't lost any of its power. This is also thanks to the great build-up directing by Lewis Milestone. He knows how to create the right certain tension and the atmosphere that goes with it. He also had a real eye for detail, especially of course during the battle sequences. Because of its many little details the movie also becomes a very realistic one.The movie features some great looking and also at times innovating The camera positions and angles, as well as the good fast editing. It makes this a technical fantastic movie to watch.Obviously none of the actors are among the greatest of their time but the characters are all nevertheless great, since they are very humane and realistic and each has their own strong identity.A movie that you HAVE to see at least once in your lifetime.10/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",N/A
642,Battleship Potemkin,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3067842/,"FILMING OF OUTDOOR events on a truly grand scale is the hallmark of this film. It is obvious that there was near unlimited budget and an autocratic and absolute control exerted by the director, Comrade Sergei Eisenstein. The filming is done in such a carefully plotted manner as to appear to be an actual newsreel documentary.THE STORY IS a retelling of a 1905 incident of rebellion and mutiny against the hierarchy of the Imperial Czarist Russian Navy. It builds its tension with use of varying camera angles, liberal doses of editing, imaginative & original lighting and boldly placed bits of shocking realism.THE FILM IS very powerful and will hold just about anyone's interest for the duration of its time on the screen. We do recommend that anyone and everyone can and should see it at least once, But we do do with just one caveat to all.THAT PRECAUTIONARY WARNING would be that we all must remember that the movie is and was intended as a propaganda piece for the likes of Joe Stalin and his comrades the USSR. Director Eisenstein definitely knew of what side his bread was buttered as he carefully crafted the telling of this 1905 incident on the Black Sea as an allegorical work. In his capable hands & clapboard, the whole situation and all of the incidents surrounding it were reduced to metaphor for the Russian Revolution and the ascent of the Communist Party.DURING THE PROCESS of telling this story, the director actually manages to make a case for the dignity of man. Now that is just bizarre and ironic; when one considers the track record of the Kremlin masters. The Communist Party has always called itself: ""The Vanguard of the People"", no matter how many of their own people that they had to kill to prove it.",Battleship Potemkin
643,Battleship Potemkin,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0003593/,"With workers striking in Russia, the crew of the battleship Potemkin feel a certain kinship for the plight of their brothers. When they are served rotting, maggot infested meat some of the crew object, only to find themselves singled out and placed in front of a firing squad. With the marines seconds away from firing the deadly shots, ordinary seaman Grigory Vakulinchuk steps into the breach and intervenes to save the men by appealing to the firing squad to ignore their orders. When the officers take their revenge and kill Vakulinchuk, all are bonded together in the struggle; a bond that reaches to the city of Odessa where the rebellion grows, leading to a bloody and historic series of events.It is hard to imagine that anybody who has seen quite a few films in the past few decades would be unaware of this film, but it is perhaps understandable that fewer have had the opportunity to actually sit down and watch. I had never seen this film before but had seen countless references to it in other films and therefore considering it an important film to at least see once. The story is based on real events and this only serves to make it more interesting but even without this context it is still an engaging story. The story doesn't have much in the way of characters but it still brings out the brutality and injustice of events and it is in this that it hooked me  surprisingly violent (implied more than modern gore) it demonising the actions and shows innocents falling at all sides in key scenes. The version I saw apparently had the original score (I'm not being snobby  modern rescores could be better for all I know) and I felt it worked very well to match and improve the film's mood; dramatic, gentle or exciting, it all works very well.The feel of the film was a surprise to me because it stood up very well viewed with my modern eyes. At one or two points the model work was very clearly model work but mostly the film is technically impressive. The masses of extras, use of ships and cities and just the way it captures such well organised chaos are all very impressive and would be even done today. What is more impressive with time though is how the film has a very strong and very clean style to it  it is not as gritty and flat as many silent films of the period that I have seen; instead it is very crisp and feels very, very professional. Of course watching it in 2004 gives me the benefit of hindsight where I can look back over many films that have referenced the images or directors who have mentioned the film in interviews; but even without this 20:20 vision it is still possible to see how well done the film is and to note how memorable much of it is  the steps and the firing squad scenes are two very impressive moments that are very memorable. The only real thing that might bug modern audiences is the acting; it isn't bad but silent acting is very different from acting with sound. Here the actors all over act and rely on their bodies to do much of their delivery  word cards just don't do the emotional job so they have to make extra effort to deliver this.Overall this is a classic film that has influenced many modern directors. The story is engaging and well worth hearing; the directing is crisp and professional, producing many scenes that linger in the memory; the music works to deliver the emotional edge that modern audiences would normally rely on acting and dialogue to deliver and the whole film is over all too quickly! An essential piece of cinema for those that claim to love the media but also a cracking good film in its own right.",Battleship Potemkin
644,Knives Out,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5443482/,"Being a middle aged Englishman I've been brought up on a diet of murder mystery stories and in many respects I've been spoilt. When the stories have translated from book to screen the production value is almost always secondary to the good conjunct story. I was very excited, having read the reviews, that seemingly in the case of 'Knives Out' I would be getting a rare trinity of a good story, good actors and good production. It certainly has two of the three. Unfortunately this film thinks it's cleverer than it is. It's simply a story of a privileged family and their pettiness with a rather trivial murder mystery chucked in as a contrivance to get them all together. Rian Johnson attempts to display the worst nature of the privileged minority with all the subtlety of a man screaming 'I am woke' at the top of his lungs at anybody who'll listen. Unfortunately subtlety and nuance are what makes for a good mystery story, you need to pay attention so as not to miss anything. With this film you could miss probably the middle third of the film and you'd not be any less aware of what's happening. A bit of a shame really.",Knives Out
645,Knives Out,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5555146/,"Good story with a creative and effective delivery. Very well written screenplay with all loose ends tied up together and reasonable foreshadowing and morals that echoes throughout, but there weren't any striking moments even to the point of final reveal, possibly due to the addition of yet more details approaching the end in an attempt to create a (slightly) forced satisfying end. Unnecessary characters and scenes that serve little to no purpose in the story other than for comedic effect were present, which maybe one of the reasons why audience may have a sense of emptyness when leaving the theatre. Nonetheless, Knives Out remains a fresh form of storytelling that is trying to achieve and convey more than your ordinary murder mystery.",Knives Out

651,"I, Daniel Blake",https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3738301/,"Many other reviewers have already spoken eloquently and in detail, in praise of this deeply moving, superlative film. I'd just like to offer an observation from a somewhat different angle. What struck me about 'I, Daniel Blake' was an aspect of subaltern powerlessness that pundits often overlook, i.e., that the poor and marginalized are almost never in control of their own time. In the USA dentists, doctors, therapists, lawyers, and all sorts of professionals get to maximize and monetize their time to the nth degree. As for govt. agencies like the DMV or employment or benefits offices--they are often (under-)staffed by bureaucrats who are in no hurry to accommodate John Q. Public. Patients/clients/supplicants wait (and wait and wait) in their spot on the usually stalled conveyor belt to get their allotted modicum of perfunctory attention. After all, they're just cogs in the revenue stream and THEIR time is deemed unimportant. Same thing with phone access to govt. agencies, bureaucracies, insurance companies, you name it. These corporate entities have complex and often confusing ""phone trees,"" long wait times on hold (during which horrendous music plays), and customers reps who are often either obtuse, indifferent, mean-spirited, or confused themselves. For the poor seeking any sort of public assistance these nuisances and indignities are multiplied tenfold because--as 'I, Daniel Blake' dramatizes--the System doesn't really want to serve the so-called ""disadvantaged""; it wants poor folk in need to get discouraged and go away (and hopefully die and decrease the surplus population).","I, Daniel Blake"
652,Isle of Dogs,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4083123/,"I had very high expectations going into Isle of Dogs, being a great admirer of Wes Anderson's work, and especially off the fumes of his previous film, The Grand Budapest Hotel (2014). If you look at Wes' filmography, you will notice that each of his films progressively become more focused, detailed, and ""Wes Anderson-ey"". It feels as if his films have been building to a culmination of sorts, which can be represented with Isle of Dogs.The story revolves around a young boy, Atari, who is seeking his lost dog with help from a pack of dogs on Trash Island, right outside of Megasaki City (word-play on Nagasaki), a fictional future city of Japan that is exiling dogs due to a ""canine flu"" outbreak.From a filmmaking viewpoint, Isle of Dogs has it all in spades, and more. The characters are well rounded and relatable, even though the majority of them are dogs. The presentation of the story is very fresh and unique, and the humor is always smoothly intertwined with the narrative and visuals. With a runtime of an hour and 40 minutes, it flies by, always keeping your attention and further engaging you. The stop-motion animation is very well done, and the way it is contrasted with beautiful Japanese imagery is stunning. The soundtrack is also excellent, and aids in telling the story. There are many nods towards Japanese cinema, chiefly Akira Kurosawa's films, which you can tell that Wes has a passion for. The voice cast is star-studded and wonderful as always. There are plenty of twists and surprises, and the film leaves the viewers with some important messages/themes to ponder over. It is best to go into the movie knowing as little about the story as possible, and let it take you on its journey.This film will greatly reward repeat viewings. The attention to detail in every frame is incredible, and there is always so much on the screen to absorb and process, in the best way possible. I believe that Wes Anderson has the most distinct and easily discernible style of any filmmaker to ever live, and this quality alone is something to be praised very highly.If you love dogs, Japanese cinema/culture, stop-motion, and animation in general, then you will love this film all the more so. Isle of Dogs, shows Wes at his full unfiltered creative power, stretching his capabilities, and giving us something truly remarkable.Ineffable Films: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls052767730/",Isle of Dogs
653,Hunt for the Wilderpeople,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3544387/,"Taika Waititi's new comedy, set in the New Zealand bush, sees the wacky manhunt of a young orphan, Ricky (Julian Dennison), and his foster uncle Hec (Sam Neil). Following the threat of returning to the public system, Ricky flees his new remote farm home, with his foster uncle tracking him down shortly after deep within the bush. With the authorities believing their disappearance to be kidnapping, both Ricky and Hec quickly become fugitives running from the law.Waititi's excellent brand of comedy doesn't disappoint, with solid character based humour and genuine laugh out loud moments throughout. If you're a fan of Edgar Wright you're sure to enjoy the visual comedic style of the movie, as well as the levity and frivolity, which isn't too dissimilar to that seen in Wright's cornetto trilogy.Casting is solid with the partnership between Neil and Dennison producing some excellent chemistry; well balanced by the comical partnership of unrelenting and headstrong child-services worker Paula (Rachel House) and incompetent police officer Andy (Oscar Kightley).",Hunt for the Wilderpeople

There are so many factors that influence one's development. And there is space for many mistakes.High quality acting. Viggo Mortensen gives one of his best performances, a devoted father that wants only the best for his kids, an authority, a leader, a teacher, loving, loyal husband, a grieving human with tough, determined, honest attitude he transmits to his children. Kids, from the youngest to the oldest, act with such naturalness that you simply dive in this masterfully-made journey.Film doesn't show how one should live and not live because both sides are flawed. Internal and external conflicts make you question the reality of the present, giving you space to find your own balance of how one should live.I personally started thinking of how there is a massive space for improvement in every field of our lives. An example is school. And how devastating it is that one could neglect the knowledge at that extant. Kids need to be inspired and motivated to learn. And more important is that they have to build inner-motivation that will make them interested and ambitious as they improve the world around them. And of course kids can't be accused for not wanting to learn if the teachers don't show them how and why to love their subject. And of course parents to support them.This (above) is just one point of where this movie has taken my entranced mind.This is a movie for every generation.

Little did I know upon my first viewing that this was the true theme of the whole movie.Arrival to its core is about the power of language, and how much language shapes who we are, what we think, how we see the world around us, etc. When the alien race comes to earth Dr. Banks is tasked with discovering their language and how to communicate with them to understand why they're here. As she learns more she discovers that they don't think like we think, or communicate like we communicate. She discovers the aliens are not bound by time as the humans are, and encourages Dr. Banks to use ""the weapon"".There's dialogue between Ian and Dr. Banks halfway through the film where they discuss the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis, which essentially means if you study a foreign language long enough you can rewire your brain; that the language you speak determines how you think. As Dr. Banks learns more of this alien language she begins acquiring the knowledge to think how they think - which is non-linear, unbound by time.This theme is present through the whole movie: from her daughter, to the spelling of her daughters name, Hannah (makes more sense upon viewing the film), to the big reveal at the end.But the true beauty is that the farther the viewer goes and acquires the knowledge along with Dr. Banks, we too understand that the story itself is non-linear - the beginning of the movie is actually the end. We see the beginning and think it's the beginning as you normally do, but as we become immersed and follow Dr. Banks, learning what she learns, we too become set free by time.The question is: if you knew your life from beginning to end, would you change anything? This movie is more than an alien invasion, which we've seen a thousand times. It's much deeper than that, and should be appreciated as such. Arrival showcases the art of storytelling.Easily a 10/10",Arrival

James McAvoy puts in a superb performance as an embittered Professor X and there are great performances from Hugh Jackman and Michael Fassbender in their respective roles as Wolverine and Magneto but the person everyone is going to be talking about is a new mutant to the series called Quicksilver played superbly with the right amount of arrogance and likability by Evan Peters. His huge action scene where he is required to rescue an imprisoned Magneto from a heavily guarded Pentagon is an absolute delight and already a contender of most amazing action scene of the year and I cant see anything beating it. Trust me - you will want to watch this scene again and again as there is so much to marvel at. Pity that Quicksilver is absent after this as the film does sorely miss the character. Hoping to see more of him in the future. The film does have a great climax though featuring a highly inventive use of a football stadium and a post credits scene with a hint of what to expect in the next movie. All in all a great movie that is going to delight and entertain young and old alike.,X-Men: Days of Future Past
668,Once Upon a Time in Anatolia,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4428701/,"Tags like a cop movie, police drama, detective thriller, murder mystery are absolutely misleading here. This film is none of the above. The ongoing police investigation is just a background of the portrayal of life in a provincial Turkish town and rural areas around it. This life is dreary, dull and boring but Ceylan shows it so masterfully you are totally captivated by the narrative. The people are talking dreary, dull and boring things but those are their everyday matters. There's no grandiloquence, no prettification, no message, no hidden meaning, only Ceylan's perfect realism, his trademark.

669,Once Upon a Time in Anatolia,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2466209/,"This film won the Grand Prix in Cannes, and it was deserved. A team goes into the countryside to find the body of a murder victim. The team includes the two men accused of the murder,one of whom has confessed and says he wills show them where they buried the body, the police chief, prosecutor, doctor, diggers, and guards. As the night drags on into the next day and the body is not found, the men grow more and more tired. Much of the film is beautifully shot in the dark or semi-dark, lit only by the headlights of the cars or a lamp in the village where they stop to rest. The filming is slow, showing the beautiful countryside and vignettes that wonderfully shed light on the different characters. What seems to be a simple task grows more and more complex; everything in the movie turns out to be more complicated than it first seems. Everyone seems to be guilty of something, so the film becomes a question not only of will the body be found, but who is guilty of what?One could say that the film is too slow, but just as the team grows more and more tired, so arewe as the viewers, participating in the fatigue of the team, drawn into the feelings of the characters. Women and children are present only as lovely cameos in the film, but are behind almost everything. The actors are all superb, and it was amazing to me that Ceylan could show such depth and breadth of character and emotion and drama with only a few lines of dialog and amazing closeups of the faces.",N/A
670,The Artist,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2529203/,"Sue me I'm not in love with the film.Yes it's funny. yes it has some charming moments, but I can not for the life of me understand how this is the front runner for this years Oscars.The plot of the film has a silent movie star meeting an extra at a premiere. Meeting again the next day on a set they are both smitten, but he's married. As her star rises, his begins to fall since he won't move from silents to sound films. However their lives remain intertwined....I laughed, a had a tear or two but I wasn't blown away. For me the film isn't all the critics have said. It's not so much a loving homage to American silent films, its more a homage to some one's idea of silent films if they really haven't seen them. The pastiche's mostly fall flat feeling more like recreations of recreations (The only silent film that feels like a real silent film is the material they stole from Fairbank's version of Zorro). There are other problems with the historical things in the film, but they are not important since this is after all just a comedy.To be honest the real problem is the film's short changes too much. Characters, such as our hero's wife are more cardboard than real. There is also the casting of people like Ed Lauter and Malcolm McDowell in roles that give them billing, but in reality are glorified walk ons (was stuff cut?) The plot also leaps through time not building to anything simply moving from moment to moment hoping that we in the audience will fill in all that isn't said.Don't get me wrong I don't hate the film, I just don't think it's the nearly the best of anything of the year.Worth a look but don't feel the need to fight the crowds.",N/A
671,Edge of Tomorrow,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3023978/,"Edge of Tomorrow (EOT for me) will be the most surprising blockbuster of this year (maybe along with X-Men: Days of Future Past) for doing its job so well that beats every expectation about what it has to offer. A storyline about one man that is shown to us doing the ""same"" things every time could be dull. But EOT has a thoughtful script full of turns and fun that entertains and allows to Cruise to do new things inside that particular Groundhog Day.I wont spoil anything because the movie is full of valuable twists, surprisingly good chemistry between Cruise and Emily Blunt (Full Metal B**ch) and it has an involving script aside of the spectacular action sequences. The first one in the movie is totally amazing. But the rest is as that good. The movie clearly develops in the action and the riveting pace. It offers what a great blockbuster should be and it reaches that superb goal.Also Tom Cruise gives his best performance in so many time. Maybe, I'm not joking, this is his best performance ever. For the first time he is not doing an smiling hero. He is a coward. He is a scared and inexperienced soldier who has to learn to be more skillful (and to escape from his personal loop) every time he returns to the ""same"" day. And Cruise is wonderful in that role. You really don't recognize him. Forget his frequent smiling, his heroic or possible macho topics. This could be a new and groundbreaking role inside his career even if you are not a big fan of him (I'm not going as far as saying that this is his best movie or the most enjoyable one of all, but this movie could be one of his best ones too). And when a movie has a star doing his job properly and much better than expected, a great script and a riveting pace (the movie is never boring) the whole concept has the job done. And that's the case of EOT. Also the stellar performances from Bill Paxton and Brendan Gleeson are truly good.In fact I'm glad that this one came after ""Oblivion"". That one was good, but this one is different and much better. Don't expect ""Oblivion 2"" or its same style because you will be wrong.Please, trust me and go to the theater to enjoy this wonderful, original and surprising entertainment. It delivers much more than you could expect, delivers the best Cruise (in so many time that I personally think that this is Cruise at his best) and delivers a clever story with a good twist.

An ache here, a wrinkle there... they add up until one day you catch your reflection unexpectedly in a mirror in the mall and wonder ""Who the heck is that old fart looking back at me?""This film captures that phase of life, taking us from the meandering comfort of growing old together, to the sudden shock of coming face to face with our perishable faculties and existence. None of us want to dwell on thought of how to deal with the slow loss of someone you love, especially in old age, and any movie that tries must tread carefully. This one never puts a foot wrong, the touchy subject is handled with grace and elegance. In doing so, it raises questions that have you thinking for days afterwards as to how you, yourself, would deal with the circumstances. And it's not just idle speculation, especially when there is someone in your own life who you love deeply and you're both getting on in years.The cold reality is that we don't know, and the beauty of this harrowing film is that it gives us one of the pathways.Of course under the law you don't have the freedom of choice to do what's best, but this story brings perfect balance to the line between moral and legal decisions. Unless you're a piece of rock you will be a changed person after seeing this artistic masterpiece. The acting is so good that the story is allowed to outshine the performances. This is truly one of the best movies I have ever seen.I can't say ""you'll enjoy it"" because it's not an enjoyable subject but I sure can say you'll appreciate the way it's done Cheers BillC",N/A

It is a ""Too long didn't read"" kind of movie.
What is the reason of this enormous more-than-three-hours runtime? Probably to enjoy as much as possible Pesci, Pacino and De Niro working together.
But folks, this time has come and gone...
Goodfellas, Casino etc. and anything Scorcese did is amazing.
But getting mob-type genre back in play in 2020 needs a bit of a twist and taste for the different audiences. 3' 24"" is outrageously long and slow even for the fanatics.
I watched it on Netflix and it took 2 days to go through the movie.
Very slow character development, which is absolutely not necessary, as we as audiences are already trained in this genre.
If you don't like this mob-type genre and these actors, there is almost no chance you would watch this movie or you 'd drop it after half an hour.
Only plus is the good acting of course and the great directing but...if you are new to this genre, start from the classics!

675,A Prophet,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2455416/,"A very rewarding second viewing. On paper it's kind of a typical rise of a gangster story, but when you get involved it's something entirely unique. Jacques Audiard is an immensely talented director and he creates an ambiance here that is chilling and intense all the way through. Few filmmakers can create action scenes that get a lump in your throat the way that he does here. Every time a knife or a gun comes on screen there's that feeling that anything can happen, it's all so gritty and real. Even some of the most skilled directors can't manage to create something that feels so real in this current state of cinema where everything is so sensationalized and the most brutal violence has become commonplace. But it never feels like the stakes are low here and nothing feels run of the mill. From the first killing until that final shootout in the SUV, every scene of violence had my blood pumping, even on a second viewing.What's most impressive about the film though is the journey that Malik goes through. For a film that takes place primarily inside a prison, the scope here is really epic. Spanning several years, it takes us on Malik's journey from this scared, uneducated thug with no friends into a bonafide crime lord with fleets at his back. It's a powerful tale, there are so few films that have created such a transformation like this. Most powerful of all is the fact that you don't even realize the scope of that evolution of character until the very end. Audiard, and Tahar Rahim in a breathtaking performance, make this journey so authentic and genuine that you just coast on this path with him without even realizing how different he becomes by the end. When the final credits roll and you look back at the young man that we started the film with, it's absolutely astonishing the evolution the character has gone through over the past two and a half hours. Audiard and Rahim create one of the finest character studies in one of the most impressive crime films of the past decade.",N/A
676,A Prophet,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2132386/,"Un Prophète :: Jacques Audiard :: France :: 2008 : 2h35A young man is being admitted into prison. The scars on his body and face betray a violent past. He can barely read and write. He has no friends. Malik (Tahar Rahim) is 19 years old. Out on the concrete courtyard, he is recruited by the ruthless Corsican mafioso César (Niels Arestrup) to kill a rival passing through their prison. Malik is beaten into submission. His life could have ended right there and then. But that is not how it was to be. Malif comes out the corner fighting. Most of the film is concrete slabs and dirt. There is the constant murmur of the rumours passed around in Arabic and Corsican if it is not in banlieue slang French. And then there is the violence. Nobody gets punished because nobody interferes. Even when inmates get killed there is no indication that they are being investigated. The detainees are all on their own. We do see the state's legal machinery operating in the background with lawyers and judges shifting paper. We see the inmates work in the prison factory sowing clothes. We see the willing bullies being schooled. But the penitentiary staff shine mostly in their absence. Malik knows it is going to be a long 6 years. He takes what he can get, and tries to make the best of himself. He could have made an excellent career for himself in the army, if life had been different. He has the adaptability, the patience, the dedication, the intelligence and the lack of moral restraint to make it far, in the right framework. If only he had been in an organisation which could contain and direct him, rather than unleash him, as prison did. We see him slowly becoming a man to be reckoned with, creating his own new order. Make no mistake, this young man is taking you along to the bitter end. Un Prophète is a tough film to watch, but immaculately constructed. I can not claim to have captured the full finesse of the all the criminal dealings, but it does not matter. The audience is thrown into the story as the young Malik is. Thrown in, to live it with him. And live it, you will. It is a masterfully made film with a clever script, an excellent cast and a surprising attention to detail. A rare pearl in the genre, bound to be as rewarded as director Audiard's previous De Battre mon coeur s'est arrêté, which won no less than 8 Césars! (incitatus.org)",Un Prophète
677,Let the Right One In,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2369960/,"The film is close to two hours long. During that time I watched the clock and wondered if anything was going to happen.Nothing did.O.k. Maybe that's being harsh. The film is, without doubt, exploring a fascinating avenue: mingling the evil of the occult and death with the innocence of childhood. The occult factor takes the form of Eli - a vampire who lives her life as a twelve year old girl and who is forced to fend for herself in the rather glum suburbs of wintertime Stockholm. She befriends a young child who is bullied at school and leads a rather lonely existence. The film centres on the friendship and the struggles of adolescence, love and being a vampire.The problem is that the movie attempts to be art-house. It indulges in long, lingering shots with very little occurring. These shots vary between close ups of the characters as they stare at various things, to wide angled shots of snow covered streets. I would like to say that the scenery is beautiful. I would like to ... but I can't. It mostly consists of red-brick cheap housing, sitting in piles of brown, slushy snow. I would like to say that the shots of the children are moving, but unfortunately they dwell for what seem like hours on a child looking gormlessly out of a window, or twitching and squirming in order to show that he is ""acting"" the emotion: ""self reflection"".What's more, the film is unrealistic to the point that bits become irritating. I'm not talking about the vampire element. I'm talking about the people who are supposed to be ""normal"". A man watches a child savage his wife and drink her blood. But (for no explicable reason) he takes her home, puts a bandage on her neck and then goes round to see a friend while he leaves her to wake up in bed. No police, no doctors. No reason. A child watches his friend lick his blood off the floor like a cat, while her face morphs into that of an old lady, and yet the next time they meet, he casually asks ""Are you a vampire?"" with the same slow, dull countenance he uses for every other scene in the film. I could go on.And furthermore - there are questions which go unanswered. What was the relationship between Eli and her carer? If she is capable of love then why does she do to him what she does, without even batting an eyelid? And what is going on with her groin!!!? So, to summarise, watch this if you want to see a very good concept for a story, ruined by annoying characters, daft behaviour and lots and lots and lots of grimy snow.",Let the Right One In
678,The Wrestler,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1998411/,"In Darren Aronofsky's brilliant character drama The Wrestler, Randy ""The Ram"" Robinson (Mickey Rourke) is a down-and-almost-out pro wrestler who grapples with his own mortality and a fear of being alone and desperate. Rourke is phenomenal, delivering a powerful, highly physical performance that will knock your socks off as much as if he'd clotheslined you himself. Rourke's Randy is intrepid, a scarred battle cruiser who desperately needs to be in the ring to survive, a man who's emotions are kept as close to the vest as possible, a man with nothing else going for him other than his time in the spotlight.The Ram, probably an amalgam of several real-life wrestlers (chief among them, Randy ""Macho Man"" Savage), is a relic of the 1980s, a man who wistfully counts the scars and cuts on his body and remembers with great fondness his greatest ring moment, a pay-per-view battle against The Ayatollah. But twenty years later, he's wrestling in high-school gymnasiums, barely able to put on a decent show but still basking in any glory he can find. But the gigs hardly pay at all, and more than once The Ram is unable to pay the rent on his mobile home.Meanwhile, two people enter (and reenter) Randy's life. Cassidy (Marisa Tomei) is a stripper at a low-rent club that Randy frequents. Cassidy is just about the only person in the world that Randy can talk to; he's lonely, spending most of his postmatch time either drinking alone or patching up any new wounds. He's treading water; with no life outside of wrestling, he's just trying to make it through the night intact.Reentering Randy's life is his long-estranged daughter, played by Evan Rachel Wood, who's hated her dad for years after he abandoned the family. Randy, in case you're still not certain, is not meant to be an entirely sympathetic figure; you know why he is how he is, and you do feel bad for him, but you also understand that just about everything that's made him who he is today is due to his own decisions. The Ram is not a victim.Aside from the simple I'm-getting-too-old-for-this angle, there's a serious medical angel that presents itself early in the movie - keep on wrestling, the doctor warns, and you'll likely die in the ring. And to his credit, Randy does attempt to stop his own livelihood, but he quickly - and harshly - realizes how incredibly difficult that is. The real world doesn't want him, The Ram thinks. They only want what's in the ring.Rourke is outstanding, perhaps sparking his own career renaissance, and Tomei is simply terrific as Cassidy. Tomei is a perfect physical fit for the role of the rapidly aging stripper; she's still gorgeous, but there are just enough lines on her face to make her age believable. Tomei continues to make excellent role choices, and she completely knocks this one out of the park. Her Cassidy hurts as much on the inside - and what movie stripper doesn't? - as Randy appears to on the outside, and they have much in common. It's gratifying to see Cassidy's feelings toward Randy evolve throughout the movie.There are also several matches featuring The Ram, one of which should really appeal to wrestling fans: a hardcore match. In this kind of match, literally anything goes - barbed wire, windows, tables, chairs, anything. Yes, we all know that pro wrestling is fake, but it's fake really only in terms of the final outcome, with just a few guidelines worked out between the competitors beforehand (e.g., I'll hit you low, then you leg whip me). And of course these particular matches were staged and scripted, but man did they ever look real. You want to see something scary, check out Randy after the hardcore match, when staples - from a staple gun - are removed from his body.The Wrestler is a gritty, raw look at one man's desire to keep on keepin' on, trying to survive the only way that's still open to him, while trying desperately to connect with someone emotionally as he ages. It's heartwarming but also heart-wrenching, and the somewhat-ambiguous ending is sure to confound people who like their movies to end tidily. It's a masterpiece for Rourke, another tour-de-force for Tomei, and an award-worthy effort for Aronofsky.",The Wrestler
679,The Wrestler,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2010571/,"The Wrestler is a drama centered around an aging professional wrestler past his prime. It's so much more than that. You don't have to be a fan of wrestling to enjoy this film. The wrestling part of it can be put aside as a back story. Randy ""The Ram"" could be in any other profession, doing any other thing and could be in the same situation. That's what's so great about it. He's just a lonely guy, whose life seems to have passed him by. A middle aged man who doesn't have much going for him. Sure, he's a wrestler, but he needs wrestling more than wrestling needs him. He needs it to feel important, to feel like a somebody. He really has nothing to show for himself, no wife, just a daughter he hasn't been there for his whole life. Missed opportunities. He's sad and alone and we really do feel for him.A closer bond seems to be forming between him and his stripper friend, played by Marisa Tomei, who seems to be in a similar situation as he is. The middle aged stripper who seems to have a real connection with ""The Ram"" is shown in another misunderstood profession. We all may not be as different as we may think. Health problems compromise his wrestling career as he tries to deal with the real world and rebuild his relationship with his abandoned daughter. The scenes with Evan Rachel Wood (his daughter) are touching. Beautifully done. Rourke's character portrayal of the Ram is one of the best in a long time. He's not just acting, he transforms into the character on screen. It's amazing to watch. All the credit he's getting is truly deserved.The film is Directed by Darren Aronofsky, who also directed Requiem for a Dream. He does a beautiful job showing the sport with realism. The film respects the wrestlers and their world, and expects the same from the audience.

He is a very talented actor but hardly seen around.The background score sets an intriguing tone within minutes of the film starting.

682,Boyhood,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3147298/,For some people including myself you tend to be able to relate to a lot of the events in Masons life as he continues to age. The nostalgia that these relations create can bring both good and bad memories up and impacts like no other film can. I have to say a lot of the tough situations mason had to endure (drunk stepfathers) I can really relate to and I could feel the strong intensity in some of those moments. However not everyone has these same experiences and thus not having that nostalgic effect.So basically your enjoyment of the film is really all a matter of how much you can relate to it. Heck at one point in the film Masons journey took a different turn than what mine did thus ending the ability to relate and from there I could see why some people hated it but the way I looked at it to enjoy it was that either way I was watching the life of this person and being given the opportunity to see this new perspective.When I lost the ability to relate with Mason on his journey i started to almost dislike him for certain things for some reason. When I watched this film I didn't feel like I was watching a movie I felt like I was going through life with Mason. Others may not be able to do that but I was fortunate enough to experience it like this.In conclusion this is a really love it or hate it type movie. If you can relate to some experiences it can be very enjoyable but for others it can seem very boring and pointless. I can really see both sides but I definitely enjoyed the film and In those final credits I nearly teared up because I just realized what I had experienced. This is hard to explain but if you understand then you obviously get what I'm saying.

684,"4 Months, 3 Weeks and 2 Days",https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1854912/,"4 Months, 3 Weeks, 2 Days is a heavy, heavy film. I knew going in that it was considered by most to be a one-timer, a film that needs to be experienced, but one that will not make you want to watch again for a long time if ever. I guess I just didn't think it would be as hard to watch as it is. When the synopsis says that the movie revolves around a young woman helping to assist her friend in getting an abortion, it means it. From start to finish, Cristian Mungiu's work encompasses a single day from morning to night, packing while still not quite grasping the situation to silence upon the slow realization of the hell that they have just visited and may never be able to leave. For our main character, this is absolutely the longest day of her life and an abortion is the least of her troubles.Otilia is played by Anamaria Marinca to perfection. She is asked to go through some excruciating events while centered in frame for extended periods of time. There are multiple long takes focused on her reactions and facial expressions while those around her converse and go about their business. When the abortion is finalized and about five minutes of straight, uncomfortable silence go by from the viewpoint of the bed looking at Otilia, we switch to a profile close-up of her as she tries to stay calm while attempting to chastise her friend for her lies and complete bungling of the proceedings. The way she must fight back the tears so as not to fully harm the distraught patient is hard to watch especially knowing what she had just gone through to allow the termination to occur. There are many more instances like this one, including a scene square on her at the dinner table of her boyfriend's family. Cityfolk and successes, they talk about the inferiority of countryfolk as though they don't realize one is sitting with them. They laugh and speak about how the young have no respect for their elders; well I wouldn't either if my elders had no respect for humanity.By no means should anyone watch this film unless they absolutely know what they are getting into. Probably the most controversial film I've seen in a long time, if not ever, this Palme d'Or winner will divide audiences and shock them to the core. It definitely begs the question for whether abortions should be legal. If you are pro-life or pro-choice, you have to still believe in safety for the mother. In a world where the procedure is illegal, we have young girls afraid of what is happening to them. They, like Gabita (a realistically tragic turn from Laura Vasiliu), face denial and wait too long to the point where their lives become at risk. An argument can surely be made that if Romania had legal abortions, this woman may have gone to a hospital earlier on rather then wait the duration of time expressed by the film's title. With the issue of the right to life being only one example, this movie unveils a country locked into the past with a society of people without freedom. Upon graduation from college, each student is assigned an area to work the rest of their lives, and they cannot go anywhere without their ID card as their movements are tracked to the point where one would get in trouble from the police for a card with a faded letter on their name.Seeing what the world has come to during her journey to help a friend, Otilia finds out a lot about herself. She sees the selfishness of those around her, the reality of relationships before a career path is set being futile, how tenuous trust is between strangers and friends alike, and the responsibility that life truly requires. This film is an education on life and all the hard times it will throw at you. One has to weigh all her options and accept the situation she is in to do what she thinks is right whether onlookers will agree or not. Between what is asked of her by the ""doctor"" performing the termination and what her friend asks as far as disposing of the fetus, Otilia experiences a crisis of identity and faith without the ability to have any release, shown perfectly by the final shot of the film, (how perfect is that wedding reception dish set down by the waiter?).While so much is rough to watch, nothing is done for shock value alone. Each instance happens in full context to the story. Between the rapes, the abortion procedure in full, the shocking static shot of the bathroom floor upon Otilia's return, the frantic run to find a place for the fetus' disposal, and even the short throwaway scene of the hotel receptionist giving the ""doctor's"" ID card over as he forgot it has meaning. This man goes through the entire film saying how he has hid nothing, used his name and his car with fear of imprisonment if caught, and then we see that he left his ID card, the one thing it appears is crucial to life in Romania only leads to one explanation: he had been lying the entire time. However, can you really judge him fully after he performs the illegal service with professionalism and complete care? You most definitely can once you consider his payment, but either way it is still very uncomfortable to see this monster of sorts pat Gabita's leg before leaving and saying ""good luck"" with complete sincerity. The film keeps you on your toes, moreso during the extended periods of silence, throwing tragic realities your way, mirrored off of the face of a woman broken completely under the weight placed on her shoulders, just attempting to get through the night in one piece. It's brilliance housed in a very mentally tough package.","4 Months, 3 Weeks, 2 Days"
685,"4 Months, 3 Weeks and 2 Days",https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1761036/,"A visceral and emotionally draining experience. Those are not typical superlatives one usually conjures while commenting on a movie, yet in this case I dare use such a characterization as a positive rendering of what I felt when watching this film.The spartan and minimalist style of the movie only adds to its potency. Though many might find it jarring to sit through, I can only hope that people will have the patience and resolve to watch this brilliant example of movie making. If you invest your time and emotions in this one, you will not be disappointed.The acting, camera work, cinematography are of the highest quality, especially given the budgetary restrictions and scarcity of available resources.This movie is yet more ample proof that one does not necessarily need a 200 million dollar budget to make a great film. Creativity and originality can add untold dimensions to any physical limitations and barriers. All in all a great ""little"" movie about a forgotten slice of history, a little known place and, a time of horrifying brutality and oppression i.e. the so-called Golden Age (epoca de aur), Romania and Nicolae Ceausescu. This movie, ""4 luni, 3 saptamani si 2 zile/4 Months, 3 Weeks and 2 Days"" is the first installment in a proposed trilogy entitled ""Amintiri din epoca de aur/Tales From The Golden Age"".I'm looking forward to the next chapters...","4 luni, 3 saptamani si 2 zile / 4 Months, 3 Weeks and 2 Days"
686,Star Trek,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4993752/,"Disappointing goofball action comedyThis is a goofball Mission Impossible comedy, that contains highly campy and pantomime so-called villains, endless cheesy jokes and one-liners at the expense of any actual Star Trek ideals.
I personally do not like it and think it is a step in the wrong direction.",N/A
687,In Bruges,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1831715/,"This is exactly my sort of film. If you like edgy, minimalist crime capers, this is your sort of film too. If you liked ""The Limey"" and/or ""The Matador"", I think you'll like this one. Really I thought I'd like this one, but didn't expect it to be as satisfying as it was.Colin Farrell really should be considered for an Oscar for this performance. He plays Ray, a troubled hit-man who is struggling to come to terms with the aftermath of a hit gone wrong. While some commenters have noted Ray's erratic behavior, few have mentioned his quite profound crisis of conscience. Some might say he has no conscience but that is undercut by the moral code to which the hit men in this film adhere. This one act has thrown him completely off-course and he acts out in anti-social (and very funny) ways. He insults other tourists; he is excessively irritated by minor things. He is completely disinterested in sightseeing in the beautiful medieval city (it's in Belgium) where he and and his laid-back accomplice, Ken (the ever professional Brendan Gleeson) have been sent with instructions to lay low until they get their next word from their boss, Harry (Ralph Fiennes playing a character whose job and demeanor seem very similar to those of Ben Kingsley in ""Sexy Beast."" That said, Fiennes, makes this role his own with his passion and intelligence).Director Martin McDonagh, as mentioned, has a flare for capturing the ultimately sad human essence of hit men. He does not glamorize them but captures them at their most mundane. The laughs seem all the funnier for their very universality. That said, he never loses sight of the fact that this story is really about hit men attempting to come to terms with what they have done. It lends the story a sobering undertone which ensures the movie will stay with you for a long time. Farrell is absolutely at the top of his game. Fiennes is (like Ben Kingsley in ""Sexy Beast"") scarily psychotic, and Brendan Gleeson is, like others have said in comments, the moral center of the film. The conclusion is satisfying and appropriate and I cannot wait to see what McDonagh does next.",N/A
688,In Bruges,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3621692/,"This movie is everything I love about movies. It's got great acting, great characters, great story, great dialogue. It's nothing short of amazing. I haven't seen Farrell in a roll like this before, but he certainly shines. Going from being a brat, to coked up as all hell, to depressed in a matter of minutes and it's hilarious as well as heart breaking.Gleeson is fantastic in his role too! He plays a perfect mix of cold and calculating, still being sophisticated and also has a conscience of sorts.Every scene in this movie develops either character or story, and the story unfolds so flawlessly with every passing scene. Going from thinking Ray is just being an arrogant brat to realizing what he has done and why he's acting like he is is a truly fascinating journey, and you can't quite tell whether to laugh or be upset by it, sometimes doing a bit of both at once.The dialogues and delivery are truly perfect, and it leaves us with so many quotable lines about topics from saving someone you were going to kill from suicide and having a discussion with him about it afterwards to race wars with midgets. Sorry, ""Dwarves"". The wife telling Harry to bring ""the fellas"" as he leaves and him apologizing for calling her an inanimate object because he was upset brings so much depth to characters and their relationship only from a minute-long scene. True magic with regards to acting and dialogue. This is why dialogue and acting is so important. It brings us closer to the person behind the character and gives the story immensely more depth and excitement.A cinematic masterpiece!",N/A
689,The Man from Earth,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2242454/,"I really didn't like this movie. It is very poorly made which partly owes to its low budget but then Primer had a low budget and managed to seem much more professional than this.SPOILERS AHEAD!The scientific basis of the movie is inherently flawed as it says that his genes have happened to evolve such that they no longer have flaws when copying(mutations). But this is like saying that if you built a car perfectly you could reduce its chance of having an accident to zero when in fact the probability of the car having an accident is not a function solely of the car, it also depends upon the environment. In the same way, the chance of mutation is dependent upon the environment such as ionising radiation and mutagens and thus the mutations could not be entirely stopped by his genome.However, many sci-fi films have shaky scientific basis so we may excuse this. Then there is the fact that he doesn't scar, which would have to be unrelated to the previous genome modification but again we can excuse this as it isn't a major issue.The part that really irritated me was when it continued to peddle such misconceptions like that people still thought the Earth was flat at the time of Columbus even though that hadn't been a serious viewpoint since at least the days of Eratosthenes some one thousand years before. At one point he also attributes his fortuitous luck in not succumbing to disease to the idea that the 'Water and food were so much purer back then' (meaning neolithic times) when this is just patently false and plays to the prejudices of the New Age pseudo-intellectuals that seem to worship this film. We are much better off today in the age of quality control and water treatment than we were then even if there is the occasional gripe about HFCS or food intolerances.The final straw that proved just how crappy the film really is came when he reveals that he is in fact Jesus and spent time with the Buddha etc. by which point I was seriously wondering whether all the positive reviews of this movie were in fact the work of a Moriarty of trolls.In conclusion, the movie had some promise but was wrecked by poor acting and a host of basic scientific and historical mistakes. The movie seems to be popular only because it plays on New Age notions of the 'pure' neolithic times and the apparent simplicity of religion. If you want a good, cerebral experience then read a book, there must be dozens of sci-fi stories which explore similar themes but in greater depth and without the patronising attitude. Even some non-fiction works touch on similar themes, I would strongly recommend those by Carl Sagan for example.",N/A

I was totally engrossed... the story pulled me in like a Black Hole, I found myself wanting more and more.This film is tantalizing, not to your eyes, not to your ears, but rather where it counts the most...your brain. What a breath of fresh air, I felt satisfied in the end and invigorated.

691,Letters from Iwo Jima,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1565248/,"I was very disappointed to learn that this movie was only going to have a limited showing in the US, only one or two theaters on either coast. My wife and I both enjoyed ""Flags"" and were pleased when we learned that Clint Eastwood made a second movie, this time telling the story from the Japanese perspective. As luck would have it, we going to Japan for the holidays so we decided to try and see the movie in Tokyo during our trip. We went to the Ginza area of Tokyo and, to our surprise, the movie was completely sold out. We needed to buy tickets at least one day in advance. Further, we learned that the movie was currently number 1 in Japan. Wow  that's impressive that an American made movie would become number one in Japan! Way to go, Clint! After a little extra planning and some adjustments to our schedule, we bought advance tickets and came back the next day.We completely loved it. We were moved and stirred with many emotions including anger, anger over the horrors of war. We actually liked it better than ""Flags of our Fathers"". The movie was in Japanese and, as near as we could tell, Japanese appears to be the native language of the film. There were brief moments of English, American solders talking, one flash back scene before the war during a foreign dignitary dinner, and of course the credits at the end. The movie would have to be translated and/or sub titled to English in order to have half a chance in the US. Frankly, I think translation would take away from the movie's beauty and meaning. I understand a limited amount of Japanese so I could follow most of the story. The theater was very big and packed. I was a little uncomfortable at first; I may well have been the only American in the place. My wife (who is Japanese) and I sat next to an older couple. At several points during the film, I thought I noticed the man from the couple crying. When the film ended, my wife talked with the couple and learned that the old man's father died in Iwo jima. Later during the trip, speaking with Japanese friends and seeing the Japanese news, stories of lost loved ones from the war were common and this movie for the Japanese people has brought many of these memories out in the open.To the Japanese, Iwo jima was a part of their homeland where a foreign invader was going to land and begin its invasion on Japanese soil. Throughout all of recorded Japanese history, never had a foreign invader prevailed in war against the Japanese on Japanese land. The imperial Japanese government of that time used this when they sent fighters to Iwo jima. These fighters were to ordered to ""fight to the death"" defending their country. That to loose and not die fighting would bring disgrace to self and family. They knew that America was planning to send an overwhelming force and they knew that they were being sent to die. For Americans, Iwo jima was just another far away place and different point in time where American boys were sent and where, unfortunately, some lives were lost fighting for freedom. My god, have we become that blasé about the wars our sons and daughters are being sent to fight in? My wife and I are unique, not typical American movie goers. I'm American, my wife is Japanese. Together, we've visited and cried together at the A-bomb Dome in Hiroshima, and again at the Arizona Memorial in Hawaii. I have relatives who fought in the Pacific, she also has family who fought in the war and who lived in Hroshima. I have two sons now serving in the US Marines. Together my wife and I watched and enjoyed both movies. The movies really didn't bring anything new, historically, to us about Iwo jima. But, the movies did do an excellent job reminding us that the ones who pay the price for war are normal everyday people. People who really don't understand the reasons or the politics behind why they are being sent to die. People who live, love, and are loved by family and friends. People with dreams and ambitions. But, for some reason when called by the leaders of the time, they go forward, obey orders, and do their duty. Sometimes, paying the ultimate price.I've grown up with Clint Eastwood and it has been a wonderful entertaining journey. These two movies are, in my opinion, his best. Not because of the action, or the drama, or any of the other things that Clint Eastwood is known for, but because he's given us two interlinked stories about the affects of war on the people who are called to pay the ultimate price  people like you and me. We may be from different cultures, eat different food, speak different languages, prey to God differently, but we all have things in common. We all live, love, want to be loved, and we dream about and long for peace. And, sometimes we are called to serve and pay for the opportunity. Thank you Clint.",Letters from Iwo Jima
692,The Fall,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2244286/,"In the beginning of the Twentieth Century, in the pediatric wing of a hospital in Los Angeles, the talkative five year-old girl Alexandria (Catinca Untaru) is recovering from a broken arm. Alexandria works with her family of immigrants in the harvest of oranges and she has just lost her father. When she meets the injured stuntman Roy Walker (Lee Pace) recovering from a fall and also brokenhearted with the loss of his girlfriend to the lead actor, he begins to tell a fantastic tale about six heroes and their common enemy, the hideous Governor Odious. Black Bandit that lost his brother Blue Bandit that was killed by Odious' men; the expert in explosives Luigi that was outcast in his town by Odious; the Indian that lost his gorgeous wife that was abducted by Odious; the former slave Otta Benga that lost his twin brother in the fields of Odious; Charles Darwin that receives a rare ""Mistica Americana"" butterfly killed by Odious; and Mystic that hated Odious that destroyed the fauna and flora of his lands, join forces to defeat the evil Odious. While Alexandria fantasizes the story projecting the images of her acquaintances in the characters, the heartsick Roy uses her innocence to ask the girl to still morphine and medicines from the dispensary for him to commit suicide. ""The Fall"" is one of the most original films that I have recently watched. This adventure has a stunning opening sequence in black and white and slow motion with the Allegretto from Ludwig van Beethoven's (1770-1827) Symphony # 7 in A mayor, Opus 92 in the soundtrack. The story entwines reality and fiction, burring the situations in a certain moment, and may be understood in many layers; therefore this dramatic feature can also been seen by children and is a great family entertainment. The cinematography sets and locations are very beautiful and bright with intense use of colors. This is the type of movie that deserves to be watched more than once to have the full understanding of all situations. My vote is eight.

693,The Fall,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1864090/,"I saw this film two weeks before its scheduled release at the Los Angeles Indian Film Festival at the Arclight Cinemas in Hollywood. The film saw a surprise premiere after another in the festival was canceled. The visuals are like nothing I have ever seen before: spectacular, epic, ... words cannot describe this masterpiece of cinematography. Every scene is a work of art. The color palate is so rich, from the bright orange of desert mountains, to the vibrant red of a blood-soaked sheet, to the opulent green of the Indian's attire. The first five minutes of the film were arresting, the haunting soundtrack, the beautiful black and white images, I had goosebumps.The acting seems very candid, very real. The young Romania actress playing the role of Alexandria is adorable, and Lee Pace as always is superb as the hospitalized, paraplegic stuntman. The characters were absorbing, and the story captivating. And where many films were unworthy of the title of ""A Fairy-tale for Adults"" this film truly is. It is about love, death, adventure, responsibility, and growing up.The sheer magnitude of this film is unbelievable, shot in 18 countries, spanning many years (for the director to scout locations and cast appropriate actors) it is a true work of genius and a commitment by all cast and crew. I just hope that the filmmakers get enough out of the commercial end of this movie, to compensate them for the great effort that so obviously went into the making of this film and so that we might possibly get another like it in the future.",N/A

The runtime is short and sweet.Pro: Whimsical world with great characters, genuine story, good voice acting, fast pacing, and a short runtime Cons: Some slow pacing in the middle of the filmOverall Rating: 9.0P.S.

697,Fantastic Mr. Fox,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2163927/,"Fantastic Mr. Fox is acclaimed director Wes Anderson's first animation, specifically stop-motion, and it's, well, fantastic. George Clooney's voice as the head fox of an animal clan that shouts diversity is straight out of Danny Ocean-- cool and witty with an overlay of sentimentality that would convince you to open your hen house door to let him have his way. That's after his little speech that tries existentialism on for size, foxwise that is: ""Why a fox? Why not a horse, or a beetle, or a bald eagle? I'm saying this more as, like, existentialism, you know? Who am I?""As the animals pull a caper against farmer Bean (Michael Gambon) and his thugs, the animation pulls away from the gloom of another winner this year, Where the Wild Things Are, and confirms the fun of a well told beast fable with loads of anthropomorphism to reaffirm our love of humanity and confirm that animals, like us, will always be animals. The ease with which Anderson/Clooney convince that this stealing and mayhem are what animals do is a tribute to script and performance that seduce us into the stylistic den of thieves known as the fox lair and all its attitude and custom, sanctioned by mother nature herself.Mr. Fox: ""The cuss am I? Are you cussing with me?"" Badger (Bill Murray): ""No, you cussing with me?"" Mr. Fox: ""Don't cussing point at me!"" Such an exchange is indicative of the fun Anderson has with kids and adults by not bombarding the youngsters with profanity but winking at the adults as if to say, ""You know what I mean."" And the most violent moment comes not from scenes with guns but rather where the animals steal chickens and break their necks, done so gingerly and quietly that it seems what it is: Just what foxes do and what humans must do to eat the chickens. Darwin meets the cartoons: Mr. Fox: ""And how can a fox ever be happy without, you'll forgive the expression, a chicken in its teeth?""That's Wes Anderson for you: Sartre and satire with a dash of dashing fox.",Fantastic Mr. Fox

The director has blended together a gay coming-of-age story that is not exclusive to gay audiences, anyone can see this and relate to the family functions and dysfunctions on view here. The acting, everyone from Emile Vallee who plays the young Zach (actually the director's son) to a awesome performance by Michel Cote as the father of the family, is also wonderful.

Portrayed is a wonderful image of rural France, and it is a must see for anyone remotely linked with classical choral backgrounds, or France itself.

I didn't have any particular expectations, but I was compelled to watch it a few more times. Wonderful soundtrack - a great mix of punk and Turkish music. Loved the Turkish band acting as Greek chorus. Wonderful acting, wonderful directing. I thought I knew where the story was going, and then it went somewhere else completely. I was on the edge of my seat for the last 30 minutes or so wondering what would happen. I am definitely going to keep an eye on this director and the actors.The movie certainly starts with a jolt - the first thing you see is a Turkish band in a picturesque setting singing a song of unrequited love. Then you see Birol Unel, and my first thought was - ""This guy's Turkish?"" - because he could easily pass for an ethnic German.I think far too much has been made of the Turkish aspect of the story. They were outsiders in society, but not because of their Turkish background. Reviews that suggest that this movie is some statement on the state of Turkish ""guest workers"" in Germany are far off the mark. Every society has its outcasts - punk rockers, etc.One major issue is that I wish they could have somehow indicated when they were speaking German and when they were speaking Turkish, because this is actually an important issue (I watched it with English subtitles). To me the languages don't sound different enough to tell them apart, though I could occasionally tell when they were speaking German when I recognized some German words.",N/A

One night, he gives up living, and hits his car against a wall. However, he survives the crash and is sent to a clinic, where he meets Sibel Güner (Sibel Kekilli), a younger German Turk, with suicidal tendencies. Sibel is the younger daughter of a conservative Turkish family, and proposes a fake marriage to Cahit, in order to permit her to leave her family; in return, she would share the rent of the flat, and she would cook and clean the place, and they could have independent lives. Cahit accepts, but while living with Sibel, he falls in love for her, until a tragedy happens.I saw ""Gegen die Wand"" yesterday and I am still very impressive with this powerful German movie. It is bitter, sad, heavy, unpleasant  but also an original and very realistic non-Hollywoodian love story. The location in St. Pauli, close to the famous Reeperban Street, could not be more perfect as the environment for such depressive story of losers. The precise direction of Faith Akin (obs: IMDb dictionary does not allow to write correctly the name of the director) is stunning, and the performance of Birol Ünen and Sibel Kekilli are outstanding and deserved nominations to the Oscar. When the character Sibel reaches the bottom of the well in Istanbul, Sibel Kekilli shines with a mesmerizing performance. Unfortunately we will never see Hollywood shooting this type of story, which is recommended for very special audiences.

One day, Dave is kidnapped by two men, being sexually abused, but escapes from them four days later. In the present days, each one of them followed one way in their lives: Jimmy (Sean Penn) is married with Annabeth Markum (Laura Linney), has three daughters and has a small business. Sean (Kevin Bacon) is a detective, and his pregnant wife left him six months ago. His colleague is the detective Whitey Powers (Laurence Fishburne). And Dave (Tim Robbins) is a traumatized man, married with Celeste Boyle (Marcia Gay Harden) and having a young son. When the nineteen years old daughter of Jimmy, Katie Markum (Emmy Rossum), is found dead in the neighborhood, the three friends in childhood meet each other again, in the investigation of the murder. A tragic event happens in the conclusion of this investigation. This movie is excellent. Yesterday, I saw it on DVD and I was impressed with the direction of Clint Eastwood and the performance of the cast. It is almost impossible to highlight one actor or actress, but I was stunned with the performance of Sean Penn. It is a film based on the acting, and not on special effects, shootings or race of cars. I was very impressed, since the tragic story of the loss of the youth is very real, full of human flaws, disturbances, prejudice and judgements.

Sean Penn was really ""ACTING"" as hard as he could, Marcia Gay Harden seemed overly fidgety and pathetic. SPOILERS: The biggest weaknesses of this movie are the story elements- why did Sean Penn's relationship with his daughter seem incestuous and yet that was never examined, why is Tim Robbins in a gay cruising area when he attacks and kills a man, what does Kevin Bacon's estranged wife have to do with any of this (except to confirm that it's a ""happy"" ending for him), why does Laura Linney suddenly turn into Lady Macbeth at the end- excuse me, was Lady Macbeth even in this film before the end? And the main thread of the movie- who killed Sean Penn's daughter- oops, it was just a couple of foolish kids and they don't know why they did it. Oops, sorry.

705,Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2372286/,"Alfonso Cuarón's masterful adaptation does the source material immeasurable justice by exploring its underlying concepts in an intelligent manner. Of course, it certainly helps that the aesthetics of the film are incredible, the acting remains stellar (and the trio of young actors handle their roles admirably), and John Williams offers an amazing (and eclectic) score. Character development is superb - Steve Kloves penned a great script.First-time and young viewers will likely enjoy the film for its merits based on plot and 'adventure' alone, but it takes multiple viewings and a critical eye to enjoy the abstract ideas and nuances. Cuarón himself credited the source material as being laden with real-world issues: oppression, racism, loneliness, power, friendship, justice and so forth.This is the Harry Potter film that stands on its own and as a tremendous cinematic achievement. It challenges viewers and yet doesn't patronize them or attempt to offer answers to all of the questions presented. For instance, the ending is bittersweet at best and retains a healthy amount of ambiguity.If you've never read the books or understood the acclaim of the series as a whole, watch Cuarón's 'Prisoner of Azkaban' and you'll understand why this entry is clearly the zenith of the seven.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
706,Hero,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0990126/,"Hero is noteworthy on at least two counts.First, there are scenes of haunting beauty(""Duel in the yellow forest"" and ""Turquoise autumn"" to site a couple) that, like the best of impressionist paintings, are so affecting that you will forever see the world in a slightly different way having once beheld them.Secondly, the overall message of the film is a provocative one. The claim is that a degree of human casualties and suffering may be the optimal path to a better world, especially when the alternative is equally brutal chaos. This is not a popular theme. It has become much more fashionable to be anti-war in all cases. And understandably so, since variations of this logic have often been used in the past to justify atrocities. But the film provides a crisp litmus test for avoiding delusion: action must be taken with a heart void of malice and an unwavering commitment to the broadest possible ultimate outcome of good for all. Can anyone live up to this standard? Several characters in the movie do, each in their own way. If the standard could be met, would the world be a better place? These are questions worth reflecting on that have not been dealt with, to this depth, in any film I'm aware of.",N/A
707,Talk to Her,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0818196/,"TALK TO HER (2002) **** Javier Camara, Dario Grandinetti, Leonor Watling, Rosario Flores, Mariola Fuentes, Geraldine Chaplin.  Filmmaker Pedro Almodovar once again creates a cinematic masterpiece in his ongoing quest to bring together the war of the sexes as a harmonic convergence this time in a somewhat surreal matter involving a male nurse (Camara) and a tough yet sensitive journalist (Grandinetti) who form a unique friendship when his girlfriend, a bullfighter  (Flores), is gored and sent into a coma landing her in the hospital where Camara is taking care of his beloved' (Watling), a dancer, who he has fallen in love with her when he (in a sense) was stalking her.  Love, sex, desire and social ills fall into one heady mix of melodrama, soap opera fodder and a sprinkling of comedy as well as a memorable foray into silent cinema with `The Shrinking Lover' (think of an NC-17 version of `The Incredible Shrinking Man') that actually serves as a Greek chorus as to the happenings occurring. Controversial, bold and audacious in its execution yet ultimately haunting, harrowing and altogether human (and humane).  One of the year's best films.",TALK TO HER

But then we lean that the likable and amiable Benigno has raped Alicia, the woman who is in love with her European art cinema has a great tradition but an uncertain future in the world increasingly dominated by Hollywood Almodóvar is an ornament of European culture which proved that the form still has much to say about the human condition and can say it with charm, elegance, and attractiveness",Talk to Her

Probably because it doesn't fit in the usual concept of a movie today. And that is: watch it, be amused and by tomorrow forget about it. Living in Croatia and understanding the war horror that occurred in former Yugoslavia isn't the only reason why I mark this film with a high grade. This film isn't just about tragedy in the Balcans. It's actually about human nature.Although people that don't understand our language(s) might miss something that puts this movie in a special kind of humorous mood, the general concept always remains the same. It's a film about humanity. It's shows us how EVERY war is absurd, with only losers involved. Special feature of this movie is objectiveness...there is no usual bad guy-good guy classification..there are no pathetic tones we see everyday in a common war movie. the only thing present here is the reality of innocent people who were pushed to kill each other.Remarkable! 9/10",N/A

It should have been up for 'Best Picture', 'Best Original Screenplay', 'Best Director - and it should have won all of those. As far as I'm concerned, this may very well be the finest film on the subject of war - or conflict in general - that was ever made. I've never seen anything similar; this film manages to show so many aspects of war, of human nature; it somehow manages to capture the essence of something that is inexplicable.

712,Nine Queens,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1340610/,"This is one of the best whodunit's in years! The acting is great, and cleverly staged. Each individual adds more and more complexity to the storyline such that you can't discount whether or not they're crucial to the plot. The plot unweaves slowly, but evenly, adding layer on layer of innuendo, suggestion, twists, and turns that catch you off guard. No one character, or actor for that matter, overtakes any of the others. I don't think you'll get this consistency, unless Mamet directs. The downtown realism of Buenos Aires only adds to the story. It's not a shoot location we're used to seeing, and the novel setting creates an odd contrast to what we've seen come out of modern Europe. The action is well-paced, with a steady guessing, and wondering-what's-gonna-happen-next pace. I highly recommend seeing this movie before, and if, a US version is released.",N/A
713,Children of Men,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1565943/,"A good day to all.Children of Men was not a good movie and although the subject matter logically has a mass appeal which has probably lead to the incredible high rating, I'd really wish people would quit voting purely on the entertainment aspect. Needless to say, a movie should score highly on a variety of aspects if it is to be anywhere near the level of a true top-250 film.I really enjoyed e.g. Spielberg's War of the worlds, again because of the subject matter. But that is not to say that that is a great movie either. Great it truly is not, even though Spielberg did a much better job directing it and the cinematography and the acting can't even be compared to that of Children of Men.Children of Men has an absurd premise. In stead of depicting a world where human fertility has dropped significantly resulting in chaos, we are to swallow that 'over night' women stopped giving birth period (did the aliens from Worlds finally get it right this time?) and that the only country which can deal with this is Great Britain partially due to the introduction of a nazi-like regime. Why the rest of the world failed to do so is never explained just like everything else which is thought up as the storyline progressed.The story which is served is equally as absurd as the premise. In a nutshell we are to believe that the birth of a single baby doesn't sound the dawn of a new age but in stead will lead to scientists implementing what 'naturally' happened to this horribly acted Kee on a global scale? This to further the idea that despite the self-destructive nature of humans we are still in control of our fate? Or the proof of the existence of God since it wouldn't be possible for ordinary people to stroll through a warzone with a freshly born child being shot at with endless rounds of amo and survive? Again, this is not explained in the movie, narratives were absent much like any memorable acting, the cameo of Caine aside. The baby being born into the childless world has no real enemies, only the opposite. Yet it is being hauled through a warzone on a tip by a stoned and aging hippie whose purpose in life is to have his fart-finger pulled, in order to reach a certain group of people who's intentions remain completely vague throughout the entire film? Sigh, how utterly stupid. In 2027 there are only two boats left? One in a warzone and one owned by the 'Human project'? Sounds more like a video game to me, hardly like the story of top-rated movie.No plot development, no character depth, serious low-budget-feel cinematography and a script without any poignancy. Nothing in this movie that would make it worthy of its high ranking. Totally out of place action-shooter war-scenes and the cheap Hollywood appeal on the senses which initially seemed to be left out, magically appears (alongside the terrorist cell) during the urban shoot-out and henceforth during the so called ending of this movie. The boat being called 'The Tomorrow' came straight out of the Shallowwood textbook and made me bite my teeth till they finally broke off one by one.The poorly developed chase story which CoM basically is, is just too one-dimensional and frankly just straight out flimsy and it got boring fast. And it is so filled with implausibilities that even the greatest mathematicians of our present world will not be able to count them all. This movie could have been much much more if its back-story had been fleshed out to some degree and its storyline aspiring to be more than just covering a bunch of people constantly traveling from one dreary set to the next. Preferably with one or two strong and discerning messages (and not a score of them which are never explored and certainly had nothing to do with the actual storyline, making it the pretentious twaddle it truly became) and performed by actors worthy of playing next to Caine.An unarguably over-hyped piece of pretentious rubbish. Simply a vehicle for art-director Lubezki to play around with his camera and editing-room and for Cuaron to bludgeon the audience with disjointed references to contemporary issues with no tale to tell. A typical product of the headline-society we've become with on par appreciation.",Children of Men
714,Mulholland Drive,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0580958/,"Like most, I rented this after I heard the universal praise. And despite COUNTLESS bizarre, unexplainable moments along the way, I was very interested and entertained through 100 minutes of the film. Then the two women went to the ""performance"" late at night. The rest of movie (which is another 40 minutes by the way) is even WEIRDER than the first part AND completely contradict and dump on what I had already seen. Then the movie abruptly ends.Baffled, I wandered over to my computer to see if I could buy a clue as to what just happened. Nothing made sense, and I'm a pretty clever guy.

715,Mulholland Drive,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0580603/,"There's a sign on The Lost Highway that says:*MAJOR SPOILERS AHEAD*(but you already knew that, didn't you?)Since there's a great deal of people that apparently did not get the point of this movie, I'd like to contribute my interpretation of why the plot makes perfect sense. As others have pointed out, one single viewing of this movie is not sufficient. If you have the DVD of MD, you can ""cheat"" by looking at David Lynch's ""Top 10 Hints to Unlocking MD"" (but only upon second or third viewing, please.) ;)First of all, Mulholland Drive is downright brilliant. A masterpiece. This is the kind of movie that refuse to leave your head. Not often are the comments on the DVDs very accurate, but Vogue's ""It gets inside your head and stays there"" really hit the mark.David Lynch deserves praise for creating a movie that not only has a beautifully stylish look to it - cinematography-wise, has great   acting (esp. Naomi Watts), a haunting soundtrack by Badalamenti, and a very dream-like quality to it -- but on top of it all it also manages to involve the viewer in such a way that few movies have before. (After all, when is the last time you saw a movie that just wouldn't leave your mind and that everyone felt compelled to talk and write about, regardless of whether they liked it or hated it?)Allright, enough about all that, it's time to justify those statements.Most people that have gone through some effort to try to piece the plot together will have come to the conclusion that the first half of the picture is an illusion/a dream sequence.Of course, that's too bad for all those trying to make sense of the movie by expecting ""traditional"" methods in which the story is laid out in a timely, logic and linear manner for the viewer. But for those expecting that, I urge you to check the name of the director and come back again. ;)MD is the story of the sad demise of Diane Selwyn, a wannabe-actor who is hopelessly in love with another actor, Camilla Rowles. Due to Diane's lack of talent, she is constantly struggling to advance her career, and feels she failed to deliver on her own and her parents' expectations. Upon realizing that Camilla will never be hers (C. becomes engaged with Adam Kesher, the director), she hires a hitman to get rid of her, and subsequently has to deal with the guilt that it produces.The movie first starts off with what may seem as a strange opening for this kind of thriller; which is some 50s dance/jitterbug contest, in which we can see the main character Betty giving a great performance. We also see an elderly couple (which we will see twice more throughout the movie) together with her, and applauding her.No, wait. This is what most people see the first time they view it. There's actually another very significant fact that is given before the credits - the camera moving into an object (although blurry) and the scene quickly fading out. If you look closely, the object is actually a pillow, revealing that what follows is a dream.The main characters seen in the first half of the movie:Betty: Diane Selwyn's imaginary self, used in the first half of the movie that constitutes the ""dream-sequence"" - a positive portrayal of a successful, aspiring young actor (the complete opposite of Diane). 'Betty' was chosen as the name as that is the real name of the waitress at Winkies. Notice that in the dream version, the waitresses' name is 'Diane'.Rita: The fantasy version of Camilla Rhodes that, through Diane's dream, and with the help of an imaginary car-accident, is turned into an amnesiac. This makes her vulnerable and dependent on Diane's love. She is then conveniently placed in Betty/Diane's aunt's luxurious home which Betty has been allowed to stay in.Coco: In real life, Adam's mother. In the dream part, the woman in charge of the apartment complex that Betty stays in. She's mainly a strong authority figure, as can be witnessed in both parts of the film.Adam: The director. We know from the second half that he gets engaged with Camilla. His sole purpose for being in the first half of the movie is only to serve as a punching bag for Betty/Diane, since she develops such hatred towards him.Aunt Ruth: Diane's real aunt, but instead of being out of town, she is actually dead. Diane inherited the money left by her aunt and used that to pay for Camilla's murder.Mr. Roach: A typical Lynchian character. Not real; appears only in Diane's dream sequence. He's a mysterious, influential person that controls the chain of events in the dream from his wheelchair. He serves much of the same function as the backwards-talking dwarf (which he also plays) in Twin Peaks.The hitman: The person that murders Camilla. This character is basically the same in both parts of the movie, although rendered in a slightly more goofy fashion in the dream sequence (more on that below).Now, having established the various versions of the characters in the movie, we can begin to delve into the plot. Of course I will not go into every little detail (neither will I lay it out chronologically), but I will try to explain some of the important scenes, in relation to Lynch' ""hint-sheet"".As I mentioned above, Camilla was re-produced as an amnesiac through her improbable survival of a car-accident in the first 10 minutes of the movie, which left her completely vulnerable. What I found very intriguing with MD, is that Lynch constantly gives hints on what is real and what isn't. I've already mentioned the camera moving into the pillow, but notice how there's two cars riding in each lane approaching the limo.Only one of the cars actually hit the limo; what about the other? Even if they stayed clear of the accident themselves, wouldn't they try to help the others, or at least call for help? My theory is that, since this is a dream, the presence of the other car is just set aside, and forgotten about. Since, as Rogert Ebert so eloquently puts it ""Like real dreams, it does not explain, does not complete its sequences, lingers over what it finds fascinating, dismisses unpromising plotlines.""Shortly after Rita crawls down from the crash site at Mulholland Dr., and makes her way down the hillside and sneaks into Aunt Ruth's apartment, Betty arrives and we see this creepy old couple driving away, staring ghoulishly at each other and grinning at themselves and the camera. This is the first indication that what we're seeing is a nightmare.Although the old couple seem to be unfamiliar to Betty, I think they're actually her parents (since they were applauding her at the jitterbug contest). Perhaps she didn't know them all that well, and didn't really have as good a relationship with them as she wanted, so the couple is shown as very pleasant and helpful to her in the dream. They also represent her feelings of guilt from the murder, and Diane's sense of unfulfillment regarding her unachieved goals in her life.A rather long and hilarious scene is the one involving the hitman. Diane apparently sees him as the major force behind the campaign trying to pressure the director to accept Camilla's part in the movie (from Adam's party in the second half of the movie), and he therefore occupies a major part of her dream. Because of her feelings of guilt and remorse towards the murder of Camilla, a part of her wants him to miss, so she turns him into a dumb criminal.This scene, I think, is also Lynch's attempt at totally screwing his audience over, since they're given a false pretence in which to view the movie.Gotta love that 'Something just bit me bad' line, though. :)The next interesting scene is the one with the two persons at Twinkies, who are having a conversation about how one of them keep having this recurring nightmare involving a man which is seen by him through a wall outside of the diner that they're sitting in. After a little talk, they head outside and keep walking toward the corner of a fence, accompanied of course by excellent music matching the mood of the scene.When reaching the corner, a bum-like character with a disfigured face appears out from behind the corner, scaring the living crap out of the man having the nightmare. This nightmare exists only in Diane's mind; she saw that guy in the diner when paying for the murder. So, in short, her obessions translate into that poor guy's nightmares. The bum also signifies Diane's evil side, as can be witnessed later in the movie.The Cowboy constitutes (along with the dwarf) one of the strange characters that are always present in the Lynchian landscape -- Diane only saw him for a short while at Adam's party, but just like our own dreams can award insignificant persons that we hardly know a major part in our dreams, so can he be awarded an important part in her dream. We are also given further clues during his scenes that what we're seeing is not real (his sudden disappearance, etc.)The Cowboy is also used as a tool to mock the Director, when he meets up with him at the odd location (the lights here give a clear indication that this is part of a dream). Also notice how he says that he will appear one more time if he (Adam) does good, or two more times if he does bad. Throughout the movie he appears two more times, indicating to Diane that she did bad. He is also the one to wake her up to reality (that scene is probably an illusion made to fit into her requirements of him appearing twice), and shortly thereafter she commits suicide.The espresso-scene with the Castigliane brothers (where we can see Badalamenti, the composer, as Luigi) is probably a result of the fact that Diane was having an espresso just before Camilla and Adam made their announcement at Adam's party in the second half. It could at the same time also be a statement from Lynch.During the scene in which they enter Diane's apartment, the body lying in the bed is Camilla, but notice how she's assumed Diane's sleeping position; Diane is seeing herself in her own dream, but the face is not hers, although it had the same wounds on the face as Diane would have after shooting herself. This scene is also filled with some genuine Lynchian creepiness. Since Diane did not know where (or when) the hitman would get to Camilla and finish her off, she just put her into her own home.In real life, Diane's audition for the movie part was bad. In her dream, she delivers a perfect audition - leaving the whole crew ecstatic about her performance.Also interesting is the fact that the money that in real-life was used to pay for Camilla's murder now appears in Rita/Camilla's purse. This is part of Diane's undoing of her terrible act by effectively being given the money back, as the murder now hasn't taken place.When her neighbor arrives to get her piano-shaped ashtray, another hint is given; she takes the ashtray from her table and leaves, yet later when Camilla and Betty have their encounter on the couch, we see the ashtray appear again when the camera pans over the table, suggesting that Betty's encounter with the neighbor was a fantasy.The catch phrase of the movie Adam is auditioning actresses for is ""She is the girl""; which are the exact same words that Diane uses when giving the hitman Camilla's photo resume.The blue box and the key represent the major turning point in the movie, and is where the true identities of the characters are revealed. There's much symbolism going on here; the box may represent Diane's future (it's empty), or it may be a sort of a Pandora's box (the hitman laughs when she asks him what the key will open). Either way, it is connected to the murder by means of the blue key (which is placed next to her after the murder has taken place). The box is also seen at the end of the movie in the hands of the disfigured bum.Club Silencio is a neat little addition to further remind the viewer that what s/he is viewing is not real. It also signifies that Diane is about to wake up to her reality (her reality being a nightmare that she is unable to escape from, even in her dreams).During the chilling scene at the end where the creepy old couple reappear, Diane is tormented in such a way that she sees suicide as the only way out in order to escape the screams and to avoid being haunted by her fears.Anyway, that is my $0.02. Hope this could help people from bashing out at this movie and calling it 'the worst movie ever' or something to that effect, without realizing the plot.As usual, Lynch is all about creating irrational fears, and he certainly achieves that with this picture as well.10 out of 10.",Mulholland Drive

718,Whisper of the Heart,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1758129/,"So, I decided to get on here and review my top 10-15 movies of all time, and this is definitely on the list. What I love about this movie is it's freshness. Few movies have ever taken me to a time and place the way this movie takes me to suburban Tokyo, summer, middle school. The sights and sounds are pure magic, attention to detail beyond almost any movie I've ever seen. From the opening scene, I'm 100 percent taken into that reality. This is a very simple movie, with a very straightforward plot. No silly plot devices to inject drama or tension, just a straightforward presentation with great characters. Yet the presentation is so rich, and so layered in its texture that the movie has the power to draw the viewer completely inside its world. As the main story progresses before our eyes, think of all the little side stories which are only hinted at, yet never developed in any detail-- just as in life itself. Suzuku's mom going back to school, her sister moving out, Yuka's fight with her father, Seiji's relationship with his parents, etc etc. These are the things filling up the corners and edges of this movie, things which a more typical movie would normally leave blank. Everything about this movie screams of honesty, which is probably why it has such an effect to take the viewer back to his or her own middle school days, lazing about the hot summer days, listening to the cicadas, dreaming the way we all dreamt at that age. As joyful and exuberant as this movie is, it's realness brings about a feeling of nostalgia when it's over, and a longing for days long passed. The climactic scene with the singing is one of the greatest moments I've seen on any media-- and so unexpected! The ending, people have complained about its naivety, yet isn't that exactly how it was when we were that age? I can watch this movie again and again and the feeling never grows weak.

This is a film where you see a man hit his wife and it hits you in the gut like you're being hit yourself.  An excellent depiction of the impact of anger and violence on the members of a poor family.  In this case, they happen to be Maoris living in New Zealand. The father dominates the family because he is so powerless in the other facets of his life.  He's addicted to boozing and carousing and the only way he can really express himself is with his fists.  The wife fights back, but can be beaten into submission. But she's also allowed herself to be seduced by the boozy lifestyle and fears responsibility.  The center of the family is the oldest daughter (13), who is really the only one who can communicate with all the other members. The boys are either lost in life or lost in their own rage.

721,True Romance,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0331097/,"With at least 12 `starring actors' in character and supporting rolls, half of them legends or mega stars; this Tarantino tale defies a short review.  The different levels on which this movie works are impressive. As a love story we begin to believe that the quirky `loser' couple is unconditionally bound together.  As a pseudo `film noir' we begin to care about the fate of the central characters.  In the suspense/thriller/crime drama mode there are plenty twists and turns to push us to the edge and pull us back just in time.  The action scenes are deliciously violent and unlike most other films, this one gives us pinches of humor sprinkled in amidst the mayhem.   Even `the King' alter ego is woven in credibly enough to improve our understanding of the Clarence Worley character.The plot, albeit original, fresh and mesmerizing, seems somehow secondary to the characters and the characterizations.  Any of several rolls could have been performed over the top by what seemed to be an ensemble cast. But director Scott lets the talent go just far enough. Even the remainder of the supporting cast is wonderful; Saul Rubinek in particular does a terrific job as the puffed-up/ego-feeding movie producer.  Hollywood missed giving this movie and its cast proper recognition.With enough memorable scenes and talented stars to fuel a half a dozen blockbusters, True Romance gives us the `best bang for our buck' in years. The Walken/Hopper scene alone is worth the `price of admission' not to mention the Gandolfini/Arquette and Slater/Oldman match ups.

It is a story of coping with grief, with characters fleshed out through facial expressions rather than words and actions, and Binoche is a fine choice for the lead. The intriguing music score and fade-to-black editing provide the film with an interesting sensation, in particular alongside the cinematography and lighting, used cleverly to keep things in and out of focus. Kieslowski also plays with sound in an interesting manner, and it is hard to flaw the film on anything. We are told nothing of the background of our protagonist, the supporting characters at times appear haphazardly thrown around, and yes, there is a lot of meandering and not much story, but this surely depicts the state of mind of the protagonist.

723,Carlito's Way,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1041301/,"Right well I can say this is one of my favourite gangster films ever, and I truly regard it almost as highly as good fellas or the godfather.This is simply because of the way the story catches you. Pacino delivers an excellent performance (do you really expect any less from him?) as the main guy Carlito who just wants out of the whole gangster game. By his side is the almost unrecognisable Sean Penn. An afro wearing cocaine addict who just seems determined to lure Carlito back into the kind of world he is trying to leave.This film is easy to enjoy with a great story and a great cast. And if you look carefully enough you can see a young Viggo Mortensen (Aragorn from lord of the rings in case you don't know) as a crippled low life. Made me chuckle.Anyways, i give this movie 10/10",Carlito's Way
724,Edward Scissorhands,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0281137/,"Many people say the cried at the end of this movie... Huh! Knowing the plot already, I (a grown up man) can barely hold my tears from the very beginning whenever I watch it. Much more than just a ""cute and sad fairy tale"", this movie is a true piece of art. This is one of those rarest cases when a bunch of talented and truly, but truly dedicated people set out to create something beautiful, some chemistry occurs and ... a miracle happens. Fortunately for all of us, this miracle immortalized on film.Throughout the human history, the wisdom of generation was conveyed through fairy tales. This tale is no exception. This story, told in magic simplicity, actually has some deep philosophical meanings. While mercilessly debunking the true nature of human beings, this tragic story really tears your heart, and yet it fills it with hope. That is the true and, perhaps, the only purpose of art, if you ask me.Why do we need music, painting, theatre, poetry? Is there a real excuse for their existence? To me, the only purpose, the only excuse is to help people go on, to give them hope. And it's well worth it!To sum up, easily Tim Burton's best, this film is a masterpiece, my favorite American movie, and probably one of the best movies of all times. 10/10",N/A
725,My Left Foot,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0273215/,"I can still remember the fuss that was made when this movie was first  released. Everybody was applauding it. 14 years down the line the film  is very dated, but still very enjoyable but more importantly very  powerful.  The story centers around Poet, artist and author to be Christy Brown.  He suffers from Celerbal Paulsy (I hope that is spelled right) which  means to be all three of the above occupations is some feat that should  not go unnoticed. He lives in a large family (13 children, not all who  suffered) in a small terraced house in Dublin's City Center. The movie  begins with his birth and the late great Ray Mc Nally being told by a  nurse that there were complications during the birth. We move forward a  couple years to where we see a young Christy (played by Hugh O'Connor)  being helped around by his mother. It is a sad sight to see him  underneath the stairs of his family home watching his brothers and  sisters (all Abled bodied) living a normal lifestyle (despite being  poor) and knowing that he is just as well able to communicate. The  finest scene in this early stage of his life is when Christy writes for  the first time. In front of his family. His father is sceptical at  first however his opinion is reversed when Christy finally proves that  he is not the idiot that everybody thinks him to be.  We then move to Christy's later teenage years where he meets a nurse  with whose help he begins to learn how articulate his words. However  Christy becomes infatuated with this lady. His mother is delighted that  her son is happy however his father is once again the sceptic but this  time he has good cause to as Christy's heart is broken when this woman  announces that she is engaged to an Art dealer.   This film is brilliant and I have a massive amount of praise for Daniel  Day-Lewis who portrays Christy as an angry young man who is coming to  terms with everything in his life. He is disturbed by womens reluctance  to accept him and his condition, He is fed up of his fathers treatment  of his mother and his siblings. Day-Lewis is totally immersed in his  character and it is one of his finest roles. I have seen old interviews  with the real Christy Brown and I can safely say that it is hard at  times to distinguish is it Christy Brown or Daniel Day-Lewis on the  screen.   However the show is stolen from him by the finer performances of young  Hugh O'Connor and Ray Mc Nally. Both of whom should have got Oscars as  Best Supporting Actor (O'Connor) and Best Actor (Ray Mc Nally).  O'Connor definitely proves himself in the role because he portrays the  same qualities that Day-Lewis does as a frustrated youngster. Mc Nally  defines the typical Irish Father role that would be made humorous by  Colm Meaney in a number of films. It is such a great pity that he died  shortly after this film. Brenda Fricker must also be mentioned as the  doting mother who does everything that she can to help Christy reach  his full potential. Again she is life like to Christy Browns real life  mother however I think there were more deserving people for that Best  Supporting Actress Oscar.   This film is an amazing piece of independent film making and it really  does so the potential of Jim Sheridan as a director and actor. He would  further develop the themes of family, Irish society, loyalty in his  other films.  9 out of 10.",My Left Foot

I left the theater half-convinced that they'd cast an actor who had Cerebral Palsy in the role, even though I knew that was not the case.  The performances were generally excellent, with a special nod to Brenda Fricker and to Hugh O'Conner (I believe that's his name) as the young Christy Brown.  Christy is talented, brash, arrogant, at times vulgar and petulant-in other words, human.  This film, along with Gaby: A True Story and the documentary King Gimp, are excellent portrayals of life with CP.  By no means a complete portrait, but fine examples of the disabled as human beings.

727,Crimes and Misdemeanors,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6152881/,"This film seizes on something that would fascinate any ordinary person. The idea of knocking off someone by contract. And not just anybody, but a mentally unstable mistress who is demanding that ophthalmologist Judah Rosenthal (Martin Landau) leave his wife and come to her or else she will expose the affair to his friends and family anyways, along with certain financial discrepancies that occurred in his business. Judah is well thought of in the community, and in lots of ways an everyman who we can identify with. Judah is depicted as going through the same stages of conscience that any ordinary person in this situation might do. In noirs or stark gangster pictures, it's a common occurrence and no one frets about it : but here is a ""regular"" type guy actually goes through with the crime in all of its stages, no I can't; well, maybe; caves in; guilt --- going through the same things that I or you might go through. After all, for me at least, doing something like that is out of the question. And yet Woody makes us identify with doing just that in a real-world, not a romanticized one. His ability to take an idea like that and make is so alive is just one of his many gifts. And that's only a part of the movie, which mainly deals with the unfairness and lack of justice of the universe.One of Landau's patients is a very moral rabbi who is going blind - there is nothing that will stop it - and worse, he will be blind by the time his daughter gets married, so he won't even get to see that event. So part of Landau's inner torment is why would he get to keep his profession, his reputation, and his family at the expense of somebody else's life when a moral man like his patient and friend the rabbi has such an unjust fate?This was one of if not the the best of Woody's films. How does it end? Let's just say Woody Allen would have been very frustrated by the old production code.",N/A

729,Hannah and Her Sisters,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0233062/,"""Hannah and Her Sisters"" is a comedy/drama (though mostly drama) about a dozen characters and their stories, all connecting back to three sisters: Hannah (Mia Farrow), Lee (Barbara Hershey) and Holly (Dianne Wiest).  Hannah is the favorite, talented and kind, Lee is almost equally favored, but Holly is the outcast, with a past of drugs and always asking for money.  Other characters include Hannah's hypochondriac ex-husband Mickey (Woody Allen), her current husband Elliot (Michael Caine), Lee's boyfriend Frederic (Max von Sydow) and Holly's friend April (Carrie Fisher).Like I said before, this is not so much a comedy as it is a drama.  The comedy that's in it fits, and is good, but the drama is better.  Elliot's secret love for Lee is handled in a romantic way, but their infidelity is still seen as wrong, and you feel their guilt and inner turmoil.  Mickey thinks he has a brain tumor, he finds out he doesn't and then he feels worse, and starts desperately searching for a purpose to live.  All the other stories are equally dramatic, with comedy fittingly sprinkled in places too.The acting is quite good, everyone playing their part perfectly, whether it's big or small.  The film's best performances come from Allen (in what's no doubt his best performance) and Dianne Wiest as the extremely under-confident youngest sister.  Allen and Wiest don't necessarily carry the film, as there's no need to, but their segments were certainly the best, for me at least.  The rest of the cast put forward too, especially Max von Sydow and Michael Caine in his first (and so far his only deserving) Oscar win.Woody Allen's direction is at the top of its form here too, much like ""Annie Hall"" and his other greats.  The camera work and use of voice overs are excellent.  For instance, there is an intensely dramatic scene where the three sisters have lunch together and for the entire scene the camera rotates around the table, the speaker not always in the frame.  His script is great too, it knows when to be dramatic and when to be funny and when to be both.One of Allen's very best, 8/10.",Hannah and Her Sisters
730,Brazil,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2161967/,"Directed by an American, and written by a Czech-born playwright (Tom Stoppard), Brazil - where Monty Python meets Franz Kafka and George Orwell - is nevertheless as British as Big Ben, skewering a peculiarly homegrown strain of small-minded, receipt-issuing bureaucracy (and state-sanctioned torture). Gilliam admits he hadn't actually read 1984 before making it, but the results get remarkably close to the tone and feel of Orwell's novel, with its shabby future-retro technology and terribly polite torturers, while Kim Greist makes a great surrogate Julia to Pryce's Winston Smith. Visually awe-inspiring and, with its terrorist outrages and stultifying red tape, even more timely now than when first released.",Brazil
731,Brazil,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3353127/,"A virtual celebration of writer/director Terry Gilliam's singular creative vision and seemingly limitless imagination, Brazil is a unique movie experience. And it is kind of hard to put the label of any one particular genre on the film; it's generally referred to as ""dystopian science fiction"" (which certainly isn't wrong), but it's also a satire, a drama, a black comedy and perhaps even a fantasy film. Like many other dystopian sci-fi films (e.g. Fahrenheit 451, Equilibrium, The Hunger Games), Brazil depicts a totalitarian society, but that's about as far as the similarities with other films go.The whole design of Brazil's crazy world is unlike anything I've ever seen in other movies (with the exception perhaps of those made by the same filmmaker). Where films with similar themes typically go for a futuristic look that is defined by all the technological advancements the writers and filmmakers can dream of, Terry Gilliam chooses the complete opposite direction. In his film, technology seems to have made no progress since somewhere around the forties or fifties, and what technology there is doesn't exactly look very reliable. And unlike other dystopian films, it's not primarily the bleak aspects of a totalitarian society Gilliam wants to explore; in his film, he wants to show how hilariously insane, inept and ridiculous many of the mechanisms and instruments of oppression truly are. In that sense, Brazil is mainly a satire (at least that's how I perceive it), and it is often either darkly funny or downright hilarious.There is simply not a dull moment in the film: it's a wild ride that never lets up and almost every image on the screen practically bursts with clever (often hilarious) details; from the way food is served in restaurants to how the benefits of plastic surgery are presented, Gilliam's imagination can only be marveled at. His vision of a bureaucracy gone mad is probably the most entertaining nightmare ever put on film (I'm talking about the director's cut, of course).

But this one does.  Two of the best car chases in cinematic history bookend the film, and in between there are show-stopping musical numbers, raw humor, Illinois Nazis, and a seriously disgruntled ex-fiancee.  And it all makes perfect sense in the context of the universe created by Aykroyd (who co-wrote), Landis (who directed), and Belushi (his barely contained zeal provides the battery pack for this film).Jake (Belushi) and Elwood (Aykroyd) are the former front men of a broken down blues band (actually a stunning collection of blues talent) which disbanded after Jake was arrested several years before.  Upon his release, he discovers that his boyhood orphanage home is about to be foreclosed upon for non-payment of property taxes.  Beaten up by a nun, sung to by James Brown, and touched by God, Jake sees the light and seeks to put the band together for one last show -- a charity benefit to save the orphanage.Their journey takes them from James Brown to Aretha Franklin to Ray Charles, John Lee Hooker to Cab Calloway.  The movie showcases the overwhelming talent of singers, musicians, and genres long out of vogue with popular musical tastes.  Indeed, this movie is a vehicle for giving these performers a chance to shine -- to bring their music back to the masses and ultimately into pop-culture immortality (to go along with their more prestigious musical immortality).This film is guaranteed to make you tap your feet, laugh out loud, gasp as both a mall and and entire fleet of Chicago police cars are destroyed, and believe in the magical powers of an old cop car.

735,Manhattan,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0169223/,"There is no doubt that Woody Allen wholeheartedly loves New York City, but his attempt to illustrate the city in a Fellini-like fashion results in making the city look touristy. Seemingly the film has influenced the younger generation of New York based filmmakers and even they have made homage to this film (i.e., Jim Jarmusch's Stranger than Paradise similarly consists of well-composed medium shots and has a resembling scene of four persons sitting in a theatre. Also, Spike Lee's She's Gotta Have It features analogous landscape montages and has an akin scene of the protagonist running to meet his lover). Ironically, these youngsters present the city in more genuine manners and give Allen's Manhattan an obsolete look.Though the portrait of immature middle-aged people who can't deal with their relationships might be real, who wants to see that? Especially, Isaac Davis (Woody Allen) soliciting his former 17-year-old lover Tracy (Mariel Hemingway) not to leave for London, after discovering his other relationship doesn't work, is unbearable to watch. All central characters, maybe except 17-year-old Tracy, have the same typical-Allen-like personas in their ways of thinking and behaving--Allen might have a dictatorship as a director and it causes the lack of the characters' diversity. The screenplay contains many cliches (i.e., Allen's voiceover monologue on the opening montage to depict the city as a book's Chapter One, several pseudo-intellectual lines such as Isaac's describing his friends as ""pseudo-intellectual garbage"" talking about ""existential reality,"" Isaac's line ""Trouble is my middle name"" after his prospective lover says she's troublesome, and so on). Cinematography by Gordon Willis is inappropriately beautiful; the gap between the aesthetic visual and the half-grown content generates an uncompelling, halfway style.",Manhattan
736,Manhattan,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0169186/,"Manhattan is an exhilarating American romance set against the backdrop of New York of the late 70's: my favorite New York, the New York of painters, poets, punks, and Pauline Kael.  Three great, very American talents -- Woody Allen, Gordon Willis, and George Gershwin -- intertwine their respective gifts to create a comedy that manages to satisfy both the brain and the heart, and even, perhaps, the lower regions.Allen is so brainy and such a nebbish that he can get away with gestures that would be painfully sentimental in the hands of any other director: when he begins the movie with fireworks cut to Gershwin, it isn't to soften you up for a soap opera, but to remind you that however much his neuroses may seem to drive the scenes, its the love of New York that drives the movie.The entire cast is note perfect: Meryl Streep as his caustic bisexual ex-wife, Diane Keaton as a nervous journalist from Philadelphia, and especially Mariel Hemingway, whose performance as Allen's 17-year old girlfriend is charming, heartbreaking, and wise.Allen's comedy here is at its absolute finest.  The fact that it is interwoven with a genuinely moving love story told with a subtlety and indirection that is unheard of in today's mainstream cinema only makes the laughs that much richer.Gordon Willis' cinematography is good enough for the Museum of Modern Art. Scene after scene leaves a grin on your face as his moving (in both senses) black and white photography floats across the screen.And finally underlying everything is the music of George Gershwin, whose exubertant melodies propel the movie forward at every turn.This is Woody Allen's best movie, a great movie, and an American movie in the best sense.

737,All That Jazz,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1237020/,"Does art imitate life, or vice-versa? The brilliance of this film is that it suggests that they are imitating one another and the original, authentic part is the soul. That's too grandiose a sentiment, but here's what I mean: Does the sexy, risqué dance rehearsal number come from what is best about Gideon (his command and imagination in the art) or what is his worst, (his womanizing and failure to give honest commitment to those that love him in lieu of sexual gratification)? In the scene juxtaposing Gideon's open heart surgery with the conference on the insurance value of the show (one of the most compelling scenes in cinematic history; it manages to be graphic while maintaining dark comedic cadence) is Fosse making the cynical satirical point that life is cheap because a fiscal value CAN be put on it? Or is he mocking the cynics with a hard penance of life's bloody fragility right in the face? Those are philosophic points to be sure and there's such a rich variety of them in this movie, as to dazzle the mind. But to just concentrate on the cerebral is only half the wonder of this film which is a strong contender for Top 20 status in this writer's mind.The other half - pure Fosse - is the range of artistic expression utilized to present an integrated total whole. It's a movie that takes you the viewer on your own artistic journey from the guts of a production to the unseen polished art in Gideon's heart and mind, where even mortal death must be turned into art to be defeated. Shots of tedious life are shot in tedious muted tones, the footage looks raw at these times and if it owes anything to Fellini it's that the more hyper the closeup or edit to sparse angles, the more ""real"" the subject becomes and the LESS you feel you are watching a film.Time doesn't permit me to go on, and I don't know if any new viewers will even see this review - but if they are reading this, and you love great cinema - this is it.pax vk",N/A
738,All That Jazz,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1397635/,"Read my review of ""Newsies"" if you want my opinion of the musical genre. People just don't break into song-and-dance numbers in the course of their daily lives. Unless they are Bob Fosse, when suddenly doing so not only makes sense, but makes you wonder how we can go through life NOT singing and dancing.What this movie is, is simple: Bob Fosse unveiling his life, his knowledge, and a detailed explanation of his creative process, for future generations to evolve. This film is part biography, part self-exploration, and part legacy. It is the ""legacy"" part that is overlooked by almost everyone. If you ever dreamed of becoming a choreographer, this is the ideal place to start, because you'll watch, over and over, as Joe Gideon (Roy Schieder as the fictionalized Fosse) puts his stamp on a dance number, a process so unique and brilliant that it could easily be classified as its own form of dance rather than a subset of modern dance. If three words could sum up Fosse's style of choreography it would be ""make it sexier."" Then make it even sexier. Then, when you're done, you need to make it even sexier. The ""Airotica"" number exemplifies this, and served as the inspiration for Paula Abdul's ""Cold Hearted"" video.The movie brings Fosse's inner circle and personal life to the screen, pulling absolutely no punches. Some call this film a form of narcissism, but it's hard to see how a man looking for self-given glory would portray himself falling apart physically and personally, the years obviously having taken a toll, as well as the emotional baggage that comes with abandoning family life (and a brilliantly played daughter by Erzsebet Foldi, in what would be her only film before she retired) for a girlfriend with some side dishes for variety. The women hate Gideon's infidelity, but love the man so dearly they know not to question or challenge it.Throughout the film, we are treated to vignettes that comprise the mosaic that is the life of Fosse. Metaphors abound, and the music blends effortlessly into a film that can make two hours seem like two minutes. This is not a film that could have been written and will not be enjoyed by those of simple intellects. So much of the plot exists in the abstract, and it is up to the viewer to find what is often an incredibly subtle symbolism. Simply put, this is a well-constructed film. Fosse's ex-wife and dance protégé, Ann Reinking, auditioned for (!) and won the part based on her, while the supporting cast includes many solid names, even a young John Lithgow as Lucas. Fosse's daughter makes a cameo in the film, as does the film editor. The comedian who appears as the subject of a movie is based on Lenny, a previous Fosse film.Joe Gideon is what everyone should be no matter what they do: someone who doesn't copy others, but develops their own vision and then methodically, sometimes maniacally, makes it happen. He lives in the moment, and squeezes everything he can out of each moment. This is evidenced by Gideon's brilliant work, but also by his rapidly deteriorating health caused by living in the party moments as well as the serious ones.The ending number is for the ages, putting a spin on the sappy endings that musicals are famous for.Your life is lacking until you have seen this film. That it did not win the Best Picture Oscar for its year was an absolute tragedy. It is one of the five best films of all time.",All That Jazz

740,Dawn of the Dead,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0158748/,"When you want brutal, look no further, but when you also want to see perhaps the greatest of all comic-book movies not based on a comic-book, it's in George Romero's original take on his continuing mythology. It's not just one of the towering horror films, or horror comedies (what will a poor dead fellow do when the escalator starts?!) but one of the great sequels, more ambitious and ass-kicking than its predecessor, with a filmmaker more confident and technically proficient with his abilities.Romero didn't originally want to do *any* sequel to his original 'Night', but after a visit by some friends to a soon-to-open mall nearby his hometown of Pittsburgh, it struck a chord as to who would be coming here – and what so much consumerism in one place would mean. ""Why do they come here?"" one of the four survivors that happens upon this mall swarming with these flesh-eaters asks another. ""This meant something to them. Instinct, maybe. This was an important part of their lives,"" he responds.I don't think necessarily Romero meant to show the film as any sort of 'This is what will happen!"" type of social horror thing. It's more about, this is where we are at NOW, and in that sense, though broader and a whole LOT bloodier, it holds a place right next to a film like Network as one of the magnificent satires of its time and place, and as much about what the public is like. Romero acts as both pessimist and optimist in this world though; past all the chopped limbs, exploding heads (oh yeah!), Tom Savini stunt and make-up and intestines ripped apart, what holds up the film for me is seeing these four characters come to grip with the horror they've made for themselves, holding up in this ""paradise"" of a mall.Balls-to-the-wall horror, social horror, and some genuine paranoid horror stuff (note to self, never try and fire a gun at a single zombie when in a dark room full of electrical wiring and pipes), and plenty of rock and roll attitude, this is a personal favorite and the most entertaining horror film of its time.

""All the President's Men"" does not tell the story of Watergate but rather the story of the reporters who broke the story. Even the story of a real-life event that managed to cause the U.S. so much stress manages to entertain in this film. Robert Redford and Dustin Hoffman are well cast as Woodward and Bernstein, the reporters. Redford's best scene is probably the one with him scribbling on his notes while on the phone, and Hoffman's is probably him sneaking into an office after getting the secretary out of the room. In his Oscar-winning role, Jason Robards is excellent as the reporters' boss. The film tends to slow down a little about halfway through, though the dialogue remains somewhat interesting. I guess the film can be a little biased in the way that it shows the papers blackmailing the leaders. However, it is still an excellent film, close to perfection. Easily the Best Picture of 1976, for me.***1/2 out of ****",All the President's Men
742,All the President's Men,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3736388/,"We're in June 2017 and ""All The Presiden's Men"" from 1976 reminds us that film, sometimes, is the strongest historical document we've got. The Washington Post raising alarm signs then and now. Alan J Pakula is one of the greatest directors of his generation. Jane Fonda during her AFI Lifetime Achievement Award told us that working with Alan J Pakula was like dancing with Fred Astaire. Here the chemistry between Robert Redford and Dustin Hoffman is such that, at times, it feels like a romantic comedy, warts and all. Astonishing. Hal Holbrook as Deep Throat gives the feeling of ""thriller"" to this incredible story. We know how the story ends but that doesn't diminish our nervousness that it's perhaps a bit of impatience, just like now in 2017, to see justice be done.",All The President's Men
743,Amarcord,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0133486/,"In the corners of the mind there are memories....bitter, sweet, scary, embarrassing, wonderful....and they topple out unexpectedly and for little reason at any moment.Such is Fellini's treatment of this film.  With no real story line, we are offered a series of events....a collection drawn from his own experiences and I would suspect from his vivid imagination.While all the characters are interesting in their earthy approach to life and its problems, some of the episodes related are scarcely worth mentioning while others are quite outstanding in their appeal.  I like particularly the Greek lesson in which a little girl is taught correct pronunciation, the excitement of a celebratory bonfire with little boys playfully exploding crackers among unsuspecting villagers, a priest rather too interested in details during the confessional, Uncle Teo's eccentric behaviour and the rifle fire bringing down the bells from the belfry.There are magic moments too.  The builder afloat with friends on a calm sea looks up at the night sky filled with stars.   Turning philosopher he muses at the miracle.  ""What keeps all that stuff up there?"" he asks. and thoughtfully adds ""There are no foundations!""Another beautiful moment is the announcement of Spring after the long cold icy Winter when Nature sets free all the fluffy seeds drifting about in the wind.In retrospect there is something in this film for everybody.  I am surprised how many of the little episodes bring to mind incidents in my own life which I have long forgotten.",N/A
744,Amarcord,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0984968/,"This film is a life journey. Filled with indelible images: The peacock in the middle of the snow, the awesome vision of the ocean liner--and the blind man crying out: ""What's it like, what's it like?"", the belly-laugh inducing introduction to each of the instructors at school, the beautiful people, the grotesques. Like life itself, the movie can be perplexing and enigmatic, sometimes magical, sometimes, in the face of the political climate and history, frightening as ""simple people just trying to live get caught up in the times they were themselves creating"". I don't think any film I've ever seen has so completely captured with such profound insight and simplicity the experience of losing a parent: The visit by the father and son in the hospital in which the mother realizes the awesome finality about to approach, and the son is blissfully unaware in his adolescent ""immortality"", and the total feeling of quiet and emptiness as the father sits at the dining room table, formerly filled with joyful, loud, noisy life--now emptier than could have ever been imagined before--this whole sequence comes as a powerful conclusion to a stunning film. With a final coda a la 8 1/2, Fellini embraces the audience, telling them not to worry--memories go on, life goes on, changed, altered forever perhaps, but it goes on, beautifully, enigmatically, magically.",N/A
745,The Discreet Charm of the Bourgeoisie,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1269460/,"There are not many artists who could tell the same joke over and over again and get away with it creating the film as brilliant, funny, absurd, witty, and clever as Buñuel's ""The Discreet Charm of the Bourgeoisie"", 1972. The story of six friends who try to arrange and have a nice dinner together but cannot complete (or even start) their meal does not sound very exiting but wait until you watch this comedy. I've always known how interesting surrealism is but I never thought how funny it could be. I've seen the film four or five times - it only gets better with each viewing. Highly recommended.9.5/10.",The Discreet Charm of the Bourgeoisie
746,The Discreet Charm of the Bourgeoisie,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1168680/,"Bunuel is arguably the greatest of all filmmakers. With the possible exceptions of Hitchcock and Fassbinder, I can think of no other director who so completely understood the potential of the medium to transcend the traditional conventions of narrative, or exploited this potential with such élan. And he doesn't rely on special effects: we enter the surreal realm so seamlessly that it at times seems banal. This is especially the case in 'Le charme': banal people have banal sub-consciousnesses.In order to begin to appreciate Bunuel I had to immerse myself in his milieu, so foreign was his sensibility to the usual expectations I had brought with me into a movie theater.It took me several viewings to get the 'jokes' if 'Le charme'. The Ambassador from some obscure Latin American country ('Miranda', or 'wonder', a nod to Shakespeare), supports this little microcosm of comfortable Parisian bourgeois respectability with cocaine smuggled in diplomatic pouches. Guests arrive for a dinner party on the wrong evening, and interrupt the hosts having sex. A wake is being held in the back room of the restaurant they are planning to dine at. Ice cubes for martinis must be 'exactly zero degrees'. Elegant ladies sit down for a fashionable afternoon tea, only to be told by their waiter that the restaurant has run out of water (?!!). A soldier then comes to their table and relates his parricidal dream, while the polite ladies listen to him unfazed. One of the ladies discreetly slips away for an assignation with another one's husband. Only Bunuel! Doubtless the inspiration for this film comes from the Latin Bunuel's lifetime of experience observing the French in situ. Much of its fun comes from simply watching the French be so . . . French. And there is no bourgeois like a French bourgeois! Much of 'Le Charme' takes place in the nightmares of its characters: you are sitting down for a dinner being hosted by a general, only to realize that you are on stage (with a prompter giving a cue from Don Juan: 'Invite the commander's ghost for dinner!'); your elegant dinner party is broken up by a gang of thugs looking to kill you. However, you are so wedded to the ceremony of the dinner party that you get caught stealing a piece of meat from the table under which you are hiding (and end up dying like a dog!) I could see this movie a hundred times and always find something new. I would never be bored by it.Bunuel is very funny, but he is also dense and difficult. One doesn't realize the true complexity of his films because they all seem so effortless. Nothing great comes easily. He's like great Bordeaux: you can't quaff it -- it demands to be sipped.Bunuel is famous for having the lowest shoot to take ratio of any filmmaker, less than 2:1. Second takes were rare (compare with the reams that end up on the cutting room floor for the typical Spielberg film.) He knew exactly what he wanted to see before he shot. Hitchcock, a director who resembles Bunuel in many ways, famously referred to actors as 'cattle'. For Bunuel, they were probably more like toy soldiers. This isn't to say that he didn't get brilliant performances out of them, especially from his screen alter-ego, the wonderful Fernando Rey.Henry Miller dubbed his good friend Luis Bunuel ""The Last Heretic"". I can't think of a higher compliment. Bunuel's memoirs, 'My Last Sigh', are a must read for anyone who wants to have an appreciation of Paris in the 20s, the of art in the last century, and martinis, made as they should be, with gin.",N/A
747,"Aguirre, the Wrath of God",https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1294162/,"One of the film's highlights is the superb intro. We see a cloudy landscape of the Andes, as we hear a haunting heavenly choir singing. As the camera moves, we distinguish small dots climbing down the mountain, like little ants, but as we get even closer, we figure out they are actually human beings, most of them Inca Indians. This emphasizes one of the movie's central themes : the smallness of man confronted to immensity and wilderness of nature.Among the Indians, we see also a few Europeans dressed in 16th century costumes. These are Spaniards on their way for the conquest of the new world. A gentleman holds the hand of a noble looking lady to help her in this vertiginous descent. Another blond girl is carried in a porter chair. A monk is also part of the journey. The story is based on the diary of that monk, Gaspar de Carvajal, and is therefore inspired by real facts. The expedition was led by Pizzaro, the Conquistador of Peru, looking for El Dorado, the land of gold. As the troop arrives at the foot of the mountain, they enter an inextricable jungle and come to the shore of a wide muddy river. As they cannot go further, Pizarro appoints a part of the group to explore the river on rafts. The group will be lead by Don Pedro de Ursua (played by Brazilian director Ruy Guerra), and by Don Lope de Aguirre (Klaus Kinski). Ursua's wife, Aguirre's daughter and the monk will also embark on the journey. From then on, the movie becomes a slow-paced drifting on an endless wild river. Not much is discovered, outside hostile cannibal Indians hiding in the rain forest. But the rapacious Aguirre plots with a few of his handymen to take Ursua's place at the head of this hopeless expedition. He takes advantage of the fact that the crew is getting all the time more hungry, desperate and afraid. He fools them with promises of endless wealth. He names a stupid fat gentleman king of El Dorado, but the ""king"" will be just a puppet into Aguirre's hands, as he is to die soon after his ""coronation"", possibly poisoned. After that, Aguirre can take total control.Ursua is eliminated and his wife disappears into the woods. The monk, sole representative of the church, sides with Aguirre without a hesitation. As the journey turns into a disaster, Aguirre gets all the more megalomaniac. While his crew is slowly dying of thirst and starvation, the delirious adventurer sees himself as ruling on the biggest realm on earth, and plans to marry his own daughter to breed a new pure dynasty. Poisonous arrows are shot from the forest, decimating the few survivors, among them Aguirre's daughter who dies in his arms. Aguirre's realm is but an endless wasteland of water and trees, and his only subjects left are squirms of little green monkeys which invade the rafts like rats, but the mad conqueror has already lost touch with reality. This movie was directed by a German director, Werner Herzog, and it is possibly an allusion to Hitler's taking of power. Aguirre's thirst for conquest has no limits, even if he knows down inside that he is taking his crew on a journey towards chaos, where not even he has any chance to survive. Hist last words are ""I am Aguirre, the wrath of God, who else is with me?"" German actor Klaus Kinski, who starred in an incredible amount of B-grade flicks, was offered here a golden role, and achieves a brilliant performance, probably his best one ever.The shooting was visibly achieved in very difficult conditions. First, it was done in natural locations in the Amazon basin, which really means in the middle of wilderness. Secondly, the cast was made up of different nationalities, Germans and South Americans. Last but not least, Klaus Kinski was known as a very difficult actor to manage, and he had a very hostile relationship to director Werner Herzog, who used to call him ""my best enemy"".This journey to chaos helps us remind man's insignificance in front of overpowering nature. The feeling of helplessness will lead most to fear and subservience, while a few will deny fear by sinking into megalomania. Because they believe to be invincible, they are believed to be so by the fearful others, and it is often too late when one realizes their madness.""Aguirre"" was made in the early seventies, a time when the Western world, which had regarded itself as the epitome of civilization, was more and more questioned in its self-delusions. The Europeans had initially presented themselves as the ambassadors of God's word to barbaric Indians but they had come to plunder, enslave and destroy. Their real motive was endless greed. Even if we have got used, since then, to hear that type of message, it still remains quite actual nowadays.Parallels come to my mind between Aguirre and three other movies : ""Deliverance"", released the same year, also tells about a journey on a wild river with hostile natives in the backwoods; ""Fitzcarraldo"", filmed a decade later, was a sort of 20th century version of Aguirre also directed by Werner Herzog, and also played by Klaus Kinski; finally, the recent ""Downfall"" focuses on Hitler's own denial of reality as his country collapses.","Aguirre, the Wrath of God"
748,"Aguirre, the Wrath of God",https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1171354/,"Werner Herzog and Klaus Kinski's masterful achievement - Aguirre: The Wrath of God (Aguirre, der Zorn Gottes) is a rich and powerful film set deep in the the South American rain forest. Ostensibly a piece of historical fiction based on fragmentary evidence concerning one of the many ill-fated attempts to find and conquer the mythic El Dorado (a city of gold rumored to be anywhere from southern Canada to Patagonia), Aguirre operates on so many levels and reflects so many aspects of its story that it is difficult to convey precisely what the film is really about. It is too fictionalized (yet plausible) to fit comfortably in the ""historical fiction"" shoebox; the dialog is as much a presentistic bit of reflexive thinking as it is fitting for the historical context of the film; and the setting is so breathtaking that without a plot and without the brilliant concept and fantastic acting, the film would still be breathtaking and painful.The opening scene, which very slowly depicts a caravan of Spanish soldiers, African and South American Indian slaves, burros, horses, cannons, and provisions making their way down a steep mountain path surrounded by miles of rain forest, is breathtaking and ominous, and sets not just the tone, but the pace of the film. Many people will find the pace a little too slow to handle. After a few minutes of struggle, the nobleman leader of the expedition throws in, and appoints a small number of participants to go forward into the jungle. Of these, only Lope Del Aguirre, a career soldier with vast ruthless ambition, and Ursua, a more gentle nobleman, are really leadership material. As the party floats down-river on rafts, it rapidly becomes clear by whose will the party continues on, and who will emerge as its sole leader in the end.Herzog develops some of his usual themes in this film, and does so with poignancy and cinematography nothing short of beauty. The film is about power, madness, religion, oppression, nature, and culture, but certainly does not stop there. This is film as high art. Brilliantly executed, multi-faceted, moving, and as ambiguous as real life so often is.This is also one of the great actor Klaus Kinski's most profound and appealing roles. Though Kinski was later typecast in mad, or at least eccentric, roles, as Aguirre he is able to show his range very effectively - because the character varies from a cold, brooding, Machiavellian rationalism to an obsessive sociopathic suicidalism. The rest of the cast rises to the challenge and acts right at Kinski's level, making this film one of the best actors/production team collaborations I have ever seen.This film is definitely not for everybody, it is a long, slow sip of delicious and yet bitter wine which the typical movie-goer will only appreciate when 'in the mood' for something which requires thought and energy to watch. It is also one of my favorite films of all time.",Aguirre: The Wrath of God
749,Harold and Maude,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5485423/,"This is one of the very few American movies that bothered to employ English styled humour a la Monty Python that worked so brilliantly, the film attained cult status as soon as it was presented to the public. Interestingly, the critics of the time found this film to be so out of it and beyond their understanding that it just did nothing but upset them and cause them to denigrate this film at best. Ruth Gordon and Bud Cort are so sublime in their performances that even with the ending being so bittersweet with Maude committing suicide at the end of the film and it showing Harold how to live properly, it was still handled with brilliant humour. This is one film that was so unfortunate in not getting anything in the way of oscars, let alone nominations, that it was so unfair to it's extreme cult status in not being rewarded for the great art that it is. A truly deserving film worthy of constant watching and appreciation.",Harold and Maude

Maude wrenches Harold free from his morbid and lonely existence to show him how lush and amazing the world can be and he emerges from his experiences a happy man. This is definitely one of the films that (along with say, Fight Club, American Beauty and The Rocky Horror Picture Show) show you can be who you want to be, and you needn't let anyone oppress you.

The story line is way ahead of its time. This film also shines a light on the internal struggles that soldiers were facing outside of the obvious battles they were fighting in the war. This movie also shines a light on General Patton, on man who might be fighting the hardest battle of all. This is a great film, because it shows the humor that people were trying to use in some scenes that would get their minds off of the inevitable war that was happening. General Patton knew how he was viewed by others and he didn't care.",N/A

I thought the movie was very nicely tied together and I thought the reflections of Patton on the past was very necessary. Patton believed in reincarnation so in looking back at historical battles you can see how Patton developed his strategy. He was a student of great leaders and commanders and the movie developed that thought really well. The movie presented the characters, the actual war history, and the Germans extremely well and it is no wonder this movie received the awards it did. After watching this movie over and over again, I'm convinced that no one could have played Patton any better than George C. Scott. You can tell from the movie that he put everything he had into the character. My father-in-law was an officer under Patton in the 3rd. Army and has said over and again how realistic the movie is. I would recommend this movie to anyone looking for an excellent re-telling of WWII history.",Patton
753,The Wild Bunch,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1114772/,"Director: Sam Peckinpah, Script: Walon Green, Peckinpah, Story: Roy N. Sickner, Cast: William Holden (Pike Bishop), Ernest Borgnine (Dutch Engstrom), Robert Ryon (Deke Thornton), Edmond O'Brian (Freddie Sykes), Warren Oates (Lyle Gorch), Ben Johnson (Tector Gorch), Jamie Sanchez (Angel), Emilo Fernandez (The General), Strather Martin(Coffer), L.Q. Jones (T.C.), Albert Dekker (Pat Harrigan)Peckinpah's Wild Bunch is one of the most compelling and moving of all westerns and perhaps all films. It is one of the all time greatest films. It is a movie about dignity and honour. The ""Wild Bunch"", led by Pike Bishop(Willam Holdon) and Dutch Engstrom (Ernest Borgnine), are a wild group of aging outlaws on a quest to get that one last chance 'to score' before they retire. This film symbolizes both the aging of the outlaws and the end of the 'traditional' west. Set in 1913, the old west has given way to the industrial revolution and these men want no part of it.The movie opens up with the group riding into town dressed as armed soldiers. They rob a train station but get ambushed in the process by a group of bounty hunters resulting in a bloody shoot-out where innocent people get killed. These bounty hunters are a bunch of low life criminals hired by the detective of the railroad to go after the Wild Bunch. The man leading the group of bounty hunters,Thornton (Robert Ryan)was once a member of the gang. He is forced by the detective to go after them or go back to prison. The group of men ride out of town and end up at a Mexican village across the Rio Grande. It is here where they open up their bags of gold only to discover that they are filled with metal washers. They where hoping to retire after this robbery. In this village, they meet up with a Mexican named Angel who becomes one of the bunch. Still hoping to get their gold, they get involved with a corrupt Mexican general. The general wants to have total control of northern Mexico and so he makes a deal with the bunch. The gang rob a train carrying army rifles. They agree to give the general 16 boxes of rifles from the robbery in exchange for $ 10,000 in gold. Angel wants to have arms for the people of his village so they can be protected. They give one of the sixteen boxes to Angel in lew of the gold. When they present the boxes to the general, they tell him that one box fell into the river. The general had found out otherwise, they accuse Angel of theft. The Mexican general and his men take Angel and something bad happens to him. The Wild Bunch go after Angel and a major shoot-out ensues resulting in a extremely violent and sad end.Much like Leone's Good Bad and Ugly, their is no ""good"" guy or ""bad"" guy. Their are no moral certainties in this film. Well their actually are some. These are honour and loyalty. Like Pike says "" When you side with a man, you stay with him"". ""And if you can't do that, your some kind of animal, your finished"". Peckinpah makes us feel for the characters in this movie, we get to know them. Which makes the ending all the more tragic. This loyalty also extends to Thornton. He has no choice but to go after the bunch and once being a member himself, he struggles with this. A lot goes on during the course of this film. One has to see it more than once because something new can be found each time. This film will stay with you long after you watch it.",The Wild Bunch
754,The Wild Bunch,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1317059/,"There comes a point at which every man reaches the end of the road and is forced to make a decision. Fade away, or go out in a blaze of glory. It goes without saying that the main characters of this film chose the latter. Sam Peckinpah's classic western is the tale of a gang of outlaws who see the world they know slipping away all around them. Scores are getting more dangerous. Technology is making killing too easy. Still they fight on, because they simply wouldn't have it any other way.William Holden plays a man named Pike Bishop. He and his gang of outlaws hit banks, trains, you name it. They stick together no matter how thick things get. After a failed attempt at a bank robbery in which nearly an entire town is gunned down, the gang sets out to steal a shipment of new guns from the US Army and sell them to a Mexican general. But this will not be an easy score. Not only will they have to fend of US soldiers, but the railroad has hired a former member of their gang named Deke Thornton and a bunch of sloppy bounty hunters to stop them. Also, the Mexican general is a dangerous man with hundreds of men at his disposal. Pancho Villa and his army are also in the area. Bullets are going to fly, and fly they do.From the opening shot of children torturing a couple scorpions to death by feeding them to a colony of ants, this film makes its point very thoroughly about violence. In this shot we see efficient killers overwhelmed by an army of a weaker species of animal. The scorpions are a metaphor for Pike and his gang. Outnumbered at every turn, they are still a handful for those who would try to hunt them down.Pike and his men are able to pull off the score and deliver the guns to the general. But they don't go riding off happily into the sunset like the heroes of a traditional western. Their story could never end that way. Knowing that their way of life is coming to an end, and knowing that one of the gang is being tortured by the general, Pike calls the remaining members together. ""Let's go,"" he simply tells them. Each man knows what this means. They grab every gun they own and all the ammunition they can carry. Then they take a nice stroll down the main street of the general's compound to pay him and his army a little visit. The resulting gun battle has to be seen to be believed.Once the shooting stops, there is an odd; sad feeling that settles over the compound. The bounty hunters show up when the vultures do. The sight of his former companions' dead bodies slumped over the backs of horses is too much for Thornton to bear. You know he would have rather been there by their side during the battle, and now he cannot bring himself to claim the reward for their hides. He simply sits down in the dirt as the survivors of the compound quietly file out and an ominous wind begins blowing through the dusty streets. Moments later it's his turn to make a choice. You can't help but feel he made the right one.The Wild Bunch is an incredible film. If ever a film was ahead of it's time, this is it. See it! 10 of 10 stars.The Hound.",The Wild Bunch
755,Night of the Living Dead,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0103261/,"The budget was low.The actors were not the top of the heap,yet Night of the Living Dead is a very effective horror film.It was the film that no doubt set the standard for horror films of today.The whole idea of freshly dead corpses returning from the grave to feed on the living makes my hair stand up,even without the movie.I find myself comparing this film with 1999's The Blair Witch Project.They are similar,not in what they are about,but in how they were made.Both films took very little money to make,used no big name actors,and were very successful and effective in presenting their respective stories.Night does get rather gory and disgusting in places,but overall is worthy of the title of ""classic"".",Night of the Living Dead
756,Night of the Living Dead,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3659582/,"You can almost time it to the exact second (around 72 mins in) when audiences stopped grinning and laughing behind their hands, expecting just another safe, silly horror film, and started feeling completely and utterly terrified.Before that moment, teenagers didn't get blown up and have their intestines eaten on screen -- it simply didn't happen; everyone always survived in the end, it was fun to be afraid because everyone would be OK when the credits rolled (and this was a period when people took what happened on the big screen a lot more seriously than we do now or ever will again).George A. Romero's debut film doesn't just kill off the sweet innocent teenagers (in the aforementioned most gruesome fashion) -- which would become a staple of horror, along with zombies themselves -- he kills off everyone. Even the film's brave hero, a black man with a shotgun (a subversive decision in itself for the 1960s) gets shot in the head by a pack of zombie-hunting white men and tossed on a bonfire to end the film (the ending is filmed in photographic stills, which creates a somehow more disturbing, documentary-like grisly realism conclusion to the events).What's truly scary about 'Night of the Living Dead' isn't the zombies, it is the behaviour of human beings: it doesn't matter what kind of monster or demon you survive a battle with, in the end it's the ugliness of human nature that is going to defeat you. And for that reason the film will always resonate, no matter how badly the acting and low budget effects age.",Night of the Living Dead
757,The Lion in Winter,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3595025/,"This was the most talked about film of 1968. It is the story of an aging Henry II and his efforts to divide his kingdom at the time of his death. He has his queen, Eleanor of Acquitain, locked up in a castle and has released her to help him sort things out. He has three sons, one a petulant little man, full of fire and anxiety; the second, a man with a persecution complex who feels he is the odd man out; and the third, Richard the Lion Hearted, a warrior (who is exposed as a homosexual). This is a movie where the dialogue is fast and furious. Henry has a mistress and she becomes a pawn in this game. He tries to hand the kingdom over to a couple sons, but the conditions they place on his choice cause him to change his mind. Enter the French ruler who is furious that Henry is exerting power that he has no right to, in his opinion. The byplay between the Queen and Henry is marvelous; there is no one who can spar verbally better than Hepburn. There is a kind of dance that goes on. This is the very soul of dysfunction. I had never seen this in its day. It is a marvelous portrayal of the failings of a family. And an actual love story, as strange as that sounds.",The Lion in Winter
758,The Lion in Winter,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1437893/,"How lucky can you be to get a script like this and a cast like this all in the same movie? I've been shocked at some of the negative comments by other viewers. I was quite young when the movie came out, and didn't realize for years that Peter O'Toole wasn't the fifty year old he was playing, and Hepburn was exactly Eleanor's age at the time, so I fail to see the age mismatched some have mentioned. I'm fifty myself now, and I still find O'Toole perfectly plausible as a fifty year old in this movie. (Although, DAMN, he looked GOOD! What a gorgeous man!)As for the 'anachronistic dialog,' it was extremely intentional and would have been totally wrong without it. To our ears, the possibly more elegant speech of the period would have sounded unnatural; only by using modern language could these people sound to us as they would have sounded to each other - normal.The acting is brilliant - it would have been very hard to find any other actor who could share a screen with Hepburn without fading away to nothing, or an actress who could have done the same with O'Toole - only two of such power could stand up to one another. And this was absolutely right for these characters - as best we know, Henry and Eleanor were both that kind of person - brilliant, witty, strong-willed powerhouses. Then the supporting cast: Hopkins, Castle, Terry, and Dalton. Granted, they weren't known at the time, so Harvey, the director, may not have realized right off the bat that he had the cast of a lifetime, but he surely must have realized it fast.Then there's the script. Like most of Oscar Wilde's plays, you could pick it up, open it to any page, and find at least half a dozen quotable lines. No, people aren't normally that witty in real life, but a) these were VERY bright people as historical fact, and b) it's a play/movie! People don't speak in real life as they do in Oscar Wilde either, but it's enjoyable as hell to watch. Get over it!Some things I love about the movie are that it's made clear that no matter what Henry tells Alys, Eleanor, or himself for that matter, his real love and true equal is always Eleanor, just as he is hers. Also that, despite the at least a dozen apparent power shifts in the course of the movie, at the end, ABSOLUTELY NOTHING has changed. And you can tell that with this bunch, nothing ever will change unless it's due to factors out of their control, like death.A matter of slight historical correction to other user comments: Alys was legally betrothed to Richard; that's why she'd been raised by Eleanor. A historical correction to the script is that John, while thoroughly detestable personally, was not at all stupid, sniveling, or whining; his actual character was actually far closer to that of Geoffrey's in the script. Very little is actually known about the historical Geoffrey except that he was actually, if anything, more of a warrior than Richard, and of course, he died quite young, leaving behind two children, the son being the legal heir to Richard, and who died at the age of twelve or so, ostensibly of disease, possibly in reality of John. This wasn't considered that bad a thing, btw, as no one wanted a child as king, and John was the only one of the whole bunch who'd spent most of his life in England itself. The English nobles had seriously resented both Henry's (in his later years especially, as he tried to carve an inheritance for John out of Europe in general, France in particular) and Richard's neglect (Richard had barely set foot in England in his entire life, and was utterly indifferent to it except as a source of revenue). Also, of course, there's no historical evidence for an affair between Henry and Alys EXCEPT that I've read at least one source suggesting that Richard used this as an excuse to not go through with the marriage itself. And there's CERTAINLY no historical suggestion that Richard and Philip had an affair, although it seems highly likely that Richard was gay insofar as he was sexual at all. Bastards of royalty were a dime a dozen in those days, but NONE are attributed to Richard, nor a whiff or rumor of any affairs he ever had. Both Henry and John, on the other hand, would chase anything wearing a dress, and this was considered perfectly normal and even admirable in a ""bad boy"" sort of way. However, John took it too far, resorting to rape and starvation of wives of political enemies, and this was one of numerous driving forces for the imposition of Magna Carta on him by his rebelling nobles. Ironically, by contemporary standards, at a national level John was a far better king than Richard (Henry at his best was better, but was too often not at his best, being too bent on conquest to bother to rule effectively what he already had). However, John was nonetheless personally a rather nasty man (to put it mildly), once again proving that the best men don't necessarily make the best rulers. His personal character and actions, more than his policies, drove his own nobles into nearly successful rebellion, resulting in Magna Carta, one of the great steps in English history.Sorry for boring you silly with the history commentary - it's a period I've always found particularly interesting. You can wake up now; I'm finished.Anyway, great movie in every sense - script, acting, score, cinematography, editing; it just doesn't get better than this.",The Lion in Winter
759,In the Heat of the Night,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2946264/,"I understand how important the subject matter of this film was when it was made, but if you put aside the 'if only we could all get along' message, what you left with is a highly flawed film. The film has long drawn-out scenes like when the first suspect is being chased through the woods, while other important scenes are quickly cut to and from so fast that you can't understand how the plot advanced with so little said. The threat over whether Poitier's character is going to stay to solve the murder flip flops so many times I lost track. First Steiger wants him to go, then he wants him to stay, then go, then stay, then go. Steiger is supposed to be a racist, not necessarily stupid, so you have to wonder why he is willing to hang the first suspect he finds when he doesn't even know all the facts, especially when it's not even established if the suspect has an alibi or where or how he discovered the wallet. These are big plot holes and only one of several throughout the film. Aside from holes in the writing and directing, there are egregious goofs like the deciduous forest in late autumn during what we are lead to believe is supposed to be a sultry summer heat wave. Alongside goofs there are unclear story lines, like why the boy in the café hates the cop.The makers of this film were so intent on breaking a barrier they forgot to make a good film. I don't believe Steiger character's change of heart n the final scene, when he exhibited no softening of his own racist views throughout the story. In the Heat of the Night may have been an important film when it was made, but that doesn't make it a good film.",In the Heat of the Night
760,In the Heat of the Night,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1178915/,"One of the great films of the 60s, ""In the Heat of the Night"" hasn't aged a bit in the four decades since its release and now deserves to be ranked with the great films of all time. Beautifully atmospheric, Haskell Wexler's brilliant cinematography and Norman Jewison's first rate direction make you feel the humidity of the small Mississippi town in which a black detective teams with the redneck sheriff to solve the murder of an important industrialist.As sheriff Bill Gillespie, Rod Steiger is superb in his Oscar winning role, and this film provides Sidney Poitier with some of his greatest screen moments, including his famous admonition to Steiger that became the title of the less impressive 1970 spin off: ""They call me MISTER Tibbs!"" This is one of the few politically correct films to make its point without resorting to heavy-handed, sanctimonious preaching. Stirling Silliphant's Oscar winning screenplay never hits a false note, and the change that occurs in the relationship between the leading characters is subtle, and, therefore, believable. The two stars are ably supported by an outstanding cast of both veterans (Lee Grant, Warren Oates, Beah Richards) and newcomers (Scott Wilson, Quentin Dean, and the delightfully creepy Anthony James). The score by Quincy Jones, featuring Ray Charles' rendition of the title song, captures the proper mood throughout. In a year when the odds-makers were predicting an Oscar victory for ""Bonnie and Clyde"" or ""The Graduate,"" ""In the Heat of the Night"" surprised the prognosticators by taking the Best Picture prize and four other Oscars. Considering its theme of racial tolerance, it seemed an appropriate choice at an Oscar ceremony that was postponed following the assassination of Martin Luther King, Jr. The film's theme made it timely, but its artistry makes it timeless. The Academy made the right choice.Brian W. Fairbanks",In the Heat of the Night
761,Charade,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1416115/,"When critics talk about a romantic affair in which a couple ""lights up the screen,"" they might as well cite, in parenthesis, ""like Audrey Hepburn and Cary Grant in 'Charade.'"" As another commenter has noted, this is quintessentially a Hitchcock film -- and I feel confident it would have been significantly better if Hitchcock had made it. But the romantic pairing of Hepburn and Grant transforms this otherwise commonplace thriller into something magical. There may have been better or prettier actresses than Audrey, and there may have been better (though not handsomer) actors than Cary -- but no two actors ever exuded sophistication and playfulness the way these two do, and they play off one another in this movie with extraordinary charm and electricity. It is truly a pity that they never made another movie together because it would also have been a classic. I don't believe Hepburn ever had another leading man or Grant another leading lady as perfect as these two are together. And the story is sufficiently tense and amusing to make reasonable use of the time when Hepburn and Grant aren't on the screen together. The film also brings together three later stars -- Walter Matthau, James Coburn, and George Kennedy -- as foils for Hepburn and Grant. But it is THEIR movie all the way! One can only wish that Hitchcock had been in the director's chair.",Charade
762,The Manchurian Candidate,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0078415/,"Wow!  I was expecting right wing propaganda, or possibly even (a distant outside chance) left wing propaganda: I certainly wasn't expecting THIS. It isn't propaganda at all.  Deriving any kind of message at all from the film is difficult - one might be tempted to conclude that we ought to never trust people who cry cheap political insults like ""communist!"" or ""fascist!"" or ""racist!"" at the first opportunity, but that's just a thought.  At any rate, in order to get a message we have to think about the story for ourselves, very carefully, which makes it the very opposite of propaganda.Here's another bit of advice: don't make the mistake, as I did, of thinking now and then that Frankenheimer is drifting from the point.  He knows exactly what he's doing at all times.  Whenever it seems he's offering some interesting diversion from the main story he's really telling the main story by other means.  How good the story is I cannot convey without saying too much.  Probably the central conceit everyone knows already, which was why Frankenheimer was right to spill most of the beans as soon as possible - but he does has one or two in reserve.  One great thing about the story is that it doesn't rely at all on us thinking it likely.Everyone, from composer to cameraman, did a fine job, and the cast does an even finer one.  Angela Lansbury gives the performance of her life.  Frank Sinatra I had never seen in a movie before, and I was surprised to discover that he can act - very well, too.  It permeates down to the minor roles. Leslie Parrish as the charming innocent is certainly charming, but also subtle.  ""The Manchurian Candidate"" would easily be the best of its kind even if it weren't the only of its kind.",The Manchurian Candidate
763,The Manchurian Candidate,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3853786/,"Time is the ultimate judge, isn't that what they say? Well 1962's The Manchurian Candidate is all the evidence I need. It feels ahead of it's time still and so relevant. In 2004, Jonathan Demme - one of my heroes - remade it with Meryl Streep - one my favorites - and Denzel Washington - one of my favorites - and the whole thing felt so old hat that I had to see John Frankeihemer's 1962 version again. Wow! Angela Lansbury creates one of the greatest villains in movie history. She is phenomenal and like it happens she's the kind of monster you can't have enough of. Frank Sinatra is really good here and the creepiness of Laurence Harvey is unsurpassed. So, well, yes, time has confirmed and protected the greatness of this outrageous thriller.",The Manchurian Candidate
764,Spartacus,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3659544/,"SPARTACUS is an adventurous drama in which an idea about freedom has resisted to strength of a glorious Roman Empire. A bloody and romantic tragedy is filled with historical inaccuracies.A proud and gifted man named Spartacus, is so uncooperative in his servitude that he is sentenced to fight as a gladiator. He was transferred to a school for gladiators, led by a sly Roman businessman. Spartacus, despite harassment at school, forms a quiet relationship with a serving woman. A Roman senator, who aims to become dictator of Rome, has visited the businessman and his school. Two women from his entourage want to enjoy the fights to the death. Spartacus is one of the selected gladiators. This fight will change awareness among slaves...The main protagonist is a kind of ""trigger"" , who has changed the political situation in Rome. An arrogant and uneducated slave has risen from the bottom through an immortal idea of freedom. Mr. Kubrick has very meticulously processed topics related to leadership, true love, politicking and dictatorship. He has, regardless of the historical inaccuracies, skilfully pointed out a ruin of the great empire. The ideas of eternity can be interpreted as a kind of paradox or fear. Unlike other epic films from that time, Christian motifs were replaced with determination and desire for freedom. Dealing with ""tricky"" issues is important in this film. Mr. Kubrick, in a very clear way, shows scenes of sexual desire, homosexuality, bisexuality, and even torture through scenes of crucifixion.Scenery is impressive, especially in the final battle. Soundtrack is great. Characterization is reflected in a sort of rivalry. Rivalry in love and politics. Kirk Douglas as Spartacus has offered a good performance. The tension in his face is a reflection of seriousness of his character. He is not overly romantic, but he has a remarkable sense of leadership and fellowship. Jean Simmons as Varinia is an attractive slave and a very strong woman, who shows her pride, love and character in almost every scene. Laurence Olivier as Crassus is the main antagonist and a very complex character. He is actually an unfortunate character, because he can not feel the love and the freedom. There is always interesting and entertaining Charles Laughton as Gracchus. Peter Ustinov, in my view, did not deserve an Oscar for the role of a wily and manipulative Batiatus. Tony Curtis as Antoninus is a bit theatrical and unconvincing as an artist among the gladiators.This is an exciting epic adventure in combination with the political drama. Some ideas are truly eternal.",Spartacus
765,Spartacus,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1033844/,"From what little I've read of this film it was lucky to have been made at all. Some very big talents had some very big egos and those egos clashed repeatedly. Original director Anthony Mann was replaced by Stanley Kubrick by Producer/Star Kirk Douglas among other clashes.But the result was all worth it. The stars all give top notch performances, but the mark of a really great film is the memorability of each individual in the ensemble. To give a few examples, Charles McGraw as the sadistic trainer at the gladiatorial school, John Dall as Sir Laurence Olivier's protégé, and John Ireland as Kirk Douglas's fellow gladiator trainee are all memorable in the brief roles they have.Kirk Douglas wisely opts for a straightforward interpretation of a hero in the title role of Spartacus. He's a BC everyman, born into a world which hadn't heard anything about human rights, he knows and feels he's not just cattle. Catch the alternating scenes of Douglas and Sir Laurence Olivier addressing the slave army and the Roman Army. Olivier with his years of Shakespearean training coming across as the tyrant to be, and Douglas in simple prose talking about the slaves fighting for their hopes and dreams. Very effective.The plot concerns a revolt at a gladiatorial school which mushrooms into a crisis for the Roman Empire. Political factions led by Olivier as Crassus and Charles Laughton as Gracchus seek to use the slave revolt to further their own ends. Laughton as always is a wonder. It's a bit of unusual casting for him because his parts are usually those of very tortured souls. His Gracchus is a sly rogue, but a decent man. One of my favorite movie lines of all time is delivered by him addressing the Roman Senate where he says he'll ""take a little republican corruption for a little republican freedom."" Another sly rogue in the film is Peter Ustinov who won the first of his two Oscars as Batiatus the owner of the gladiatorial school. Like so many others I'm sure in those days, he's just trying to come out on the winning side when doing so could be a life or death situation.Jean Simmons as Varinia, beloved of Spartacus, has the only woman's part of any substance. But when was Ms. Simmons bad in anything. One of the most underrated and under-appreciated actresses in the history of film.The lessons about man's desire for freedom and to control his own destiny are eternal and valid. And this film will be also.",Spartacus
766,L'Avventura,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1943114/,"Several attractive, hip sophisticates set sail on a yacht in the Mediterranean. One of these beautiful people mysteriously disappears. And that sets up the rest of the film's plot.All of these characters are jaded, haughty, vain, shallow, and self-absorbed. They're preoccupied with romance and their personal feelings toward each other. As a result, I did not find any of them interesting or appealing in the least. Indeed, the Anna character comes across as spoiled, irritable, something of a prima donna; Claudia only slightly less so.The film's plot is slow, with long camera ""takes"". In the film's first half, a lot of time is consumed with characters walking around on an island, casually searching for the missing person. In the second half, the plot gets sidetracked, with a sequence or two on ""modern"" art. This artistic motif has little or nothing to do with the missing person, and thus conveys the impression that the film is being ""padded"", in an avant-garde sort of way, to prop up the flimsy story concept.With the howling wind, the crashing of waves against the shore, and rocks falling into the sea, the film has some impressive sound effects. The B&W cinematography is rather conventional, a little disappointing given the lush and exotic locales. Still, the Mediterranean scenery is beautiful in its own right. With a runtime of well over two hours, a thin storyline, and long drawn-out scenes wherein not much happens, the film comes across as pretentious. This is especially true given that some viewers regard ""L'Avventura"" as ""revolutionary"". Maybe it is, in an extremely subtle, artsy sort of way. On the other hand, its reputation may be based more on wishful thinking than on substantive evaluation, given the intellectual audience that this film seeks to impress.",L'Avventura
767,L'Avventura,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1044767/,"There's something strange going on in this film.The first time I watched it, it seemed to wash over me without affecting me in anyway. Later on(and I've read this in other people's comments here as well) I found images and dialogue from the movie creeping into my subconscious; entire dreams would take place upon the island where Anna goes missing(often in monochrome), or I'd start to compare real life events to those that occur during the film. Did Antonioni plant subliminal messages within the movie? Probably not. It's more likely the masterful pace he employs here, coupled with the busy, deep cinematography is the cause of this. Notice how the backgrounds NEVER go out of focus, no matter how much is going on within the frame. Check out the scene about an hour and ten minutes in, where Sandro and the old man are talking in the middle of an extremely busy street; nothing blurs or goes out of focus, even when a tram comes in and out of the shot, nothing loses it's perspective, and as the scene ends and they walk deep into the shot we can see way past them and far, far into the distance.This seems to be why the film has such a deep affect on the subconscious. The characters are deliberately shallow and are placed at the very foreground of every shot, yet the backgrounds are rich tableaux bustling with life. In the scenes on the island where Anna disappears, we see the main characters always in shot, yet in the background there is a feeling that something strange within nature itself is going on. The darkening of the clouds, the sudden mist upon the water, the rocks falling to the sea, even the sudden appearance of the old hermit character, all give a certain unease.There's also the haunting feeling of the film, as Anna's friends begin, almost immediately to forget about her. Soon, they don't seem to care a jot about her, and neither, in a sense, do we. It's this feeling of loose ends and guilt on our part(for joining her so called 'friends' in forgetting about her so quickly) that leaves the deepest impression. The characters in this film are so morally shallow(the ending bears this out) yet they are the reason this film leaves such a strong impression on those who watch it, and who become captivated by it.I cant recommend this film to everyone because I know that the Hollywood Blockbuster has reduced most modern cinema-goers attention spans to almost zero. But if you fancy a challenge, or merely wish to luxuriate in classic cinema.....begin here.",N/A
768,Hiroshima Mon Amour,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2426782/,"Memory has persistently troubled filmmakers, this facet of consciousness by which the past overwrites the present. Where do these images come from, at what behest? More importantly, by invoking memory, how can we hope to communicate to others this past experience, which only perhaps existed once? The woman says she saw Hiroshima, the charred asphalt and scorched metal, the matted hair coming out in tufts. We may have seen the same anonymous images of disaster, elsewhere, and think we saw. We see other people like her, like ourselves as mere spectators of a film, walk around the a-bomb museum in Hiroshima among the relics of disaster, lost in thought, impotent to reconstruct the experience from these glassed remnants of it. One of the great metaphors of memory, this museum that houses and presents fragmentary what used to be and how the spectators merely move inside it—internal observers of images.The woman says she saw Hiroshima, but we know she didn't really experience. We know by the same images we may have seen, and which we see again in the film. We know this from our own private efforts to relive time gone. We see the objects and sounds but not having walked among them, we only know them vicariously. Can we ever get to know through cinema for that matter? The great contribution of Resnais to cinema is firstly this, the realization that this medium is inherently equipped to inherit the problem of memory—just what is this illusory space. Inherently equipped in the same breath to fail to recapture the world as it was, like memory. Where Godard would be in thirty years, Resnais—and his friend Chris Marker—already was with his debut. He gives us here a more poignant, intelligent disclaimer of the artificiality of cinema than Godard ever did. The woman is of course an actress starring in a film—about peace we find out. But Hiroshima is not the simple ploy of a trickster, it enters beyond.We see in Hiroshima how the past forms that make up life as we have known it, and in which the self was forged, come into play. How these things, a past love or suffering thought to matter at the time, are only small by the distance of time. That we weren't shattered by them.And we see how, having been, these forms will vanish again. How this present love and perhaps the suffering that will follow it, thought to matter now, will also come to pass and be forgotten. How we will perhaps try to recount these events at a future time, our reconstructions faced with the same impotence to make ourselves known or know in turn. All that remains then, having walked the city in an effort to shape again from memory, is this moment, perhaps shared by two people on a bed. These walks taken together. Perhaps a story to tell or a film about it.Something to meditate upon.",Hiroshima mon amour
769,Hiroshima Mon Amour,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1026069/,"Hiroshima is at the heart of this deceptively simple story. Hiroshima not only as the city which received the fatal bomb on the morning of August 9, 1945, at 9:15 AM, but Hiroshima as the city of Nevers which the woman tries to escape from (but ultimately can't), and Hiroshima as the Japanese man with whom she is having a clandestine affair. The tragedy of the past dresses and undresses them like the ashes seen at the beginning of the film, superimposed on the glistening sweat from the protagonists' lovemaking... an act that will not be repeated after, or throughout the movie. Theirs is an affair that will remain devoid of a fulfilling consummation.We don't know much about these two people in the beginning: She (Emmanuelle Riva) is in Hiroshima filming scenes for an anti-war movie; he lost his family to the bombing and knows of the pain and the inconsolable loss. The Actress tells him (Eiji Okada) she knows of loss as well, and can identify. At first, we don't know what is under her skin, or why she calmly tells him there will be no more meetings, that he will go away. It is his staying, faithful, by her side, that causes her to slowly peel away at the layers of pain that have lingered just under the surface for 14 years now, eating at her, wanting some form of exorcism.Rarely has there been such naked intimacy told or filmed on screen in such unconventional manner, de-glamorizing the actors, almost depersonalizing their egos, for the sake of telling a story that took place years ago, but is still present in her mind and soul and is still happening, in an endless repetition, over and over again. Being in Hiroshima only intensifies her grief and overall isolation. Knowing the affair must eventually end and that they will go back to their lives practically turns her to stone in one scene, as morning arrives.Here is the real tragedy of the story: that we have come to care for both of these people, that they have somehow formed a bond that has been able to rise, like Hiroshima, from the ashes of the past, but that the isolation and inner torment that still rages prevents there being any simple solution -- no Hollywood ending where She will carry out her impulsive decision (that she makes one, to stay, is here, but only in desire, not action), and from what little we still know of Him, no statement that He will leave his unseen, unnamed wife. They will part, and her exclamation near the end: ""I am forgetting you already!"" is an act, a defense mechanism. She hasn't forgotten the incident at Nevers (which becomes her symbolic name at the end), nor will she forget this man whom at the end has named himself Hiroshima, in remembrance.",Hiroshima Mon Amour
770,The Ten Commandments,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3650904/,"We are facing one of the most consecrated biblical epics ever made and the magnum opus of Cecil B. DeMille. The story is well known, most people know the Bible even without having read it. Concerning the work of the cast, it's great even if we consider that they're overly theatrical and lack here some veracity and naturalness, essential to play in cinema. Charlton Heston is the great actor of the film, in the role of Moses. Yul Brynner was also excellent as Pharaoh Ramses, as Anne Baxter in the role of Nefretiri. Edward G. Robinson surprises in the role of the hypocrite Dathan. But what makes this film particularly intense is the beauty it has. The setting is one of the biggest that Hollywood has ever made, with thousands of extras with carefully detailed period costumes. Everything was thought to the detail and we love all this visual show. Of course, historical accuracy has been left in the background. DeMille had his school on Broadway and might not attach much importance to the historical details but knew how to make a great show. The visual and special effects are quite realistic, the state of the art of cinema of this time, and still can seem credible today, more than fifty years after it's premiere. The soundtrack of Elmer Bernstein is strident, betting heavily on metals and percussion, in a clearly symphonic style that was thought to make everything even more grandiose. In short: it's a consecrated epic that many people still watch, almost religiously, at Easter (in Portugal it's normal to be broadcast on TV in this period, year after year). The big problem of this film is the very theatrical dialogue and acting. It looks like theater. But we can forgive this fault because it's more or less overshadowed by the visual and sound show.",The Ten Commandments
771,The Ten Commandments,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1162319/,"The parting of the red sea! The confrontation at Mount Sinai! This movie is full of spectacular scenes and images! De Mille truly was a great filmmaker. His powerful imagination is evident in the Ten Commandments. This is his masterpiece. It carries you along on an epic adventure that is as big as the old testament. It captures the ancient, epic feel of the original Bible story. It has several stunning performances that could have easily been cheesy and fake, but are convincing and fascinating. Some say that the dialog is campy. I don't think so. I've seen this movie many times and have never thought so. It's nothing like the terrible dialog in Plan 9 From Outer Space from the same decade. The romance may be a cliché now, but it was quite original when it first came out and is still interesting. I personally don't like romance, so the fact that I wasn't bothered by this one is really saying something. This marvelous story is wonderfully told by De Mille and I would strongly recommend it.",The Ten Commandments
772,The Searchers,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2419550/,"I'm a staunch, almost rabid, defender of this film. Sometimes I feel as if even those who ""get"" this movie don't get it. It goes without saying that the cinematography is breathtaking and the technical points are masterful, few who know film would dispute that. It's recognized as one of the greatest westerns of all time by many and gets its deserved recognition on most critical lists. Even with all of its accolades, however, I feel as if it isn't enough.There's so much depth to this film and beauty to its story, its one of those films that gives you new ideas each and every time you watch it. The plot goes far beyond the heads of the pc crowd who see it as ""racist"" or ""old-fashioned"", although I suspect that some can't get over the fact that this film is truthful. The film embraces neither extreme position, that the settlers of the Old West were honorable heroes or that the Indians were always simply innocent victims by evil white men. Rather, its a portrait of humanity as a whole and still applies today. As an example, think of the relationship and parallel between the ""villain"" Scar and Wayne's character, Ethan Edwards. Both are racists, but both are extremely knowledgeable of the language and customs of the other race. Both were subject to deaths in their family from the other side that led to their attitude, both took wives from the other race. That's just one small tidbit that adds to the complexity of the characters and the dynamic between the white man and Indian, there is much, much more.The characters are multi-layered, and yet the impressive thing about it is that they never talk about it. I suspect that this is part of the reason it goes over the heads of some who believe it to be overrated, because almost all of the character background is explored visually by Ford. Even characters that are dismissed as ""corny comic relief"", are not as they seem. One example of this is Mose Harper, a character that I, for one, still haven't quite figured out.A final note on the acting, the performances by a few may be the weakest spot in the film, and that's with all the performances being very good AND this being the best performance of Wayne's career.This is a film that everyone should see, talk about, analyze, and enjoy. It really is worth it, a true masterpiece.",N/A
773,Strangers on a Train,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0045712/,"I always thought that Robert Walker was a lightweight and happened to be Jennifer Jones' husband and that was about the extent of it. Then I saw ""Strangers On A Train"" and his performance in that film changed my mind and how!! His dark, perverse character is the epitome of evil with a smiling face. He oozes through this film like a bad dream and is your worst nightmare. The story, from the book by Patricia Highsmith, is well adapted from the original and may even be better. I read the book after seeing the movie and I was biased by the images from the film that kept popping before my eyes. Farley Granger, who never was one of my favorites is all wrong for the part of Guy Haines. Hitchcock insisted on using him (see ""Rope"")....he obviously saw something in him. His personality is so unattractive that it makes you wonder how Ruth Roman could ever be in love with him. He is the perfect victim for Walker, and is a weakling who won't even go to the police when the murder swapping scenario begins. Some of the images in this film are quite striking.....the reflection in the victim's glasses, the tennis match where everyone is watching the ball except Walker, and the fingers groping in the drain for the lighter. Pure Hitchcock. Poor Robert Walker never got the chance to follow up this wonderful performance due to his untimely death and the promise he showed here as a villain may have taken him to greater characterizations. This may not be one of Hitchcock's best films but it certainly should be on everyone's list as a must-see.",Strangers On A Train
774,Strangers on a Train,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0045666/,"One would have expected Hitchcock's return to major studio filmmaking to err on the side of chastened caution.  Surely few expected his most riotous, unrestrained film, a gleeful melange of vicious black comedy, exciting suspense, mocking manipulation, and astonishing flights of fancy.  But that is precisely what they got: STRANGERS ON A TRAIN.What is remarkable is how much Bruno's transgression disrupts the world of the film.  Much has been made of the masterly crosscutting motif, but its immediate effect is to completely obstruct the straight line of progress Guy is making of his life, and hence the society he represents or is eager to join.  Guy is the archetypal American, the working-class boy made good, moving in influential circles, athletic, successful, handsome.  Bruno is his destructive opposite, gay, decadent, 'European' (he lives off his father, in a Big House, and just lounges about dreaming of murder).  Bruno's life is one of repetition, circularity, whereas Guy moves straight ahead.  It is Bruno's achievement to move Guy into his realm (represented by the merry-go-round) and force HIM to transgress (break the law, hope for murder (Bruno's)).Bruno is quite literally fighting patriarchy.  All the authority figures in the film are criticised - Bruno's father, a man whose brutality we get a glimpse of, but the true horror of which is constantly alluded to in the film (especially in Aunt Clara's paintings - that incredibly intense negative energy must come from somewhere); Anna's incredibly Machiavellian, self-serving father; the insensitive judge who thinks nothing of lunching after an execution; the tennis commentator whose smugly authorative comments are always mistaken.  Far from being the mother-hater of legend, Hitch, as Robin Wood perceived, is deeply hostile to fathers and patriarchy.Bruno's transgression turns the world topsy-turvy.  This is Hitch's most surreal film.  Whenever Guy is in his plot, he is filmed straight, with conventionally romantic music.  But whenever Bruno intrudes, the atmosphere becomes carnivalesque, bizarre, much more fun.  This is Hitch's first truly American film, revelling in the primitive detritus of Americana.  Grown men puncture little boys' balloons, or try to throw them off merry-go-rounds. Distinguished professors of mathematics sing about goats on trains.  Elderly society matrons are strangled at elegant soirees.  Washington is filmed like a series of spare lines in a vast desert under a huge sky, like a haunting Dali painting.  There is one of the greatest, and funniest, scenes in all cinema when we see a motionless, smiling Bruno in a sea of turning heads at a tennis match, an image worthy of Magritte.  Just look at any scene with Bruno in it, and watch it derail into the bizarre.Phalluses abound in the most ridiculous permutations - check all those balloons (Hitch had obviously just seen THE THIRD MAN) - as well as in more staid environs: Washington will never look the same again.  STRANGERS is also, VERTIGO notwithstanding, Hitch's most overtly sexual film - as well as the phalluses, there is the sustained homoeroticism, the remarkable play with 'riding' horses; the gobsmacking fellatio joke when Hitch's daughter spills powder over the policeman.And yet Hitch doesn't stint on good old suspense.  In the very proper endeavour to show what a great artist he was, critics tend to overlook what made him famous in the first place.  Much has been made of Bruno as a prototype of Norman Bates, and Hitch plays merry havoc on audience identification, willing Bruno into murder.  There is a hilariously painful sequence where Bruno loses the lighter with which he intends to frame Guy down a drain.  The gasps of tension and sighs of relief on the part of the audience I was a part of in support of an insane murderer is inherently funny, slightly disturbing, and highly revealing about our true reactions to conformity and success.  And Hitch milks it with callous glee - listen to the mocking music and exagerrated compositions, and kick yourself for taking it all so seriously.STRANGERS is one of Hitch's five best films, and therefore one of the greatest things in cinema.  The dialogue is so strange and brilliant, I can't believe it wasn't written by Chandler.  Patricia Hitchcock is a wonderful imp, standing in for her cheeky father as she taunts Guy.  The fairground finale is a remarkable, dizzying fusion of exciting, tense set-piece, black comedy and symbolic site.  If Bruno's final words condemn him to hell (according to the Catholic precepts Hitch is supposed to embody: compare with a similar ending in THE KILLERS), we applaud his integrity, infinitely preferable to Guy's debased serving of self.",Strangers on a Train
775,Harvey,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0042609/,"I have read that James Stewart considered Elwood P. Dowd his most personally significant role.  In a career that spanned decades and included such great works at It's a Wonderful Life and Mr. Smith Goes to Washington, choosing Harvey's friend, Elwood, as his personal favorite says something about rather powerful about Mr. Stewart and Mr. Dowd.James Stewart was a down to earth, decent man whose personal life was as honorable as the lives of George Bailey and Jefferson Smith -  but he admired Elwood P. Dowd, an alcoholic dreamer with an invisible giant white rabbit as his best friend.  Not what you would expect of a man who piloted B-17's and led giant raids over Germany in WWII.Elwood's attraction for us is perhaps what attracted him so much to James Stewart.  Elwood is happy with himself and his life and even more importantly, he makes others happy with their lives.  That is the great magic of Elwood and Harvey:  they make others happy and they bring peace and a measure of contentment to almost everyone who know them.I have seen another version of Harvey with Art Carney and it was quite good, but lacked the sense of magic that is a benediction in this version of Harvey.  In the Carney version, you can see Harvey - he is a giant white rabbit - and seeing Harvey takes much of the magic away.  When you watch Jimmy Stewart, you never really know if Harvey is real or not.  You know that Elwood thinks he is real and you know that Elwood's family thinks Elwood is crazy.  After watching for a while, you don't really care if Harvey is real.  Elwood is real and it is his belief in Harvey and what Harvey represents to him that endows him with such sweet and gentle charm. Harvey is his rejection of the harshness and materialism of the world.Harvey is a charming, magical masterpiece of kindness and goodness that somehow never becomes maudlin.  Elwood and Harvey do not feel sorry for themselves and they most certainly do not expect you to feel sorry for them either.  If anything, Elwood feels sorry for the rest of the world and he does not understand how everyone can't see as clearly as he does.  For in his world,  we are all brothers who should love as generously and kindly as Mr. Stewart's Elwood P. Dowd.",Harvey
776,Miracle on 34th Street,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0036792/,"This is certainly a lovely warmhearted movie, but since other reviewers have described the plot in detail, I'll move on to other topics.I love movies like this for the insight they provide into the customs of a lost era. Watch the clothing - everybody is so dressed up! - women in dresses, gloves, and hats, men in hats and suits. Notice that when O'Hara enters a room filled with Macy's executives, even though they are the bosses and she is lower management, they all stand up instantly.The social satire, most on display in the courtroom scenes, also is very 1940s. Apparently audiences of that era took a kind of genial corruption in the judicial system in stride. Business leaders, like ""Mr. Macy"" were expected to be sharp and profit-oriented, but also decent people like the rest of us. It's a much more nuanced view than the ""businessman as criminal villain"" so common in today's movies.The character played by Maureen O'Hara probably needs explanation for modern viewers. Late 1940s audiences knew that the social and economic situation of a divorced working woman with a child was much more precarious than it is now. Divorce was still somewhat shocking - this is brought out neatly in the movie when her would-be lover does a double take when he learns from her daughter about the divorce - he probably had assumed she was a war widow. Divorced moms were still rare in the middle classes. Society universally agreed that women should stay home to raise their children. Economically, women in management positions were still very rare, couldn't expect promotion, and were last hired, first fired. I think O'Hara's performance brings out these qualities in a way that the audience of the 1940s would have understood easily. The character's stiffness, fear of losing control, and anxiety about her job make a great deal of sense. It would have been nice to see a few scenes showing her loosening up, perhaps at dinner with her boyfriend; no doubt those got left on the cutting room floor.I really like the scene where Santa talks to the little Dutch orphan. First, this scene also must have resonated with the audience; in 1947 the western European countries had only started to recover from World War II, and probably many Americans were familiar with the idea of adopting a war orphan, just as many sent CARE packages. Second, by making Santa fluent in Dutch, the writer cleverly left the viewer thinking that hey, he might really be Santa Claus (isn't Santa Claus fluent in all languages)? Some reviewers don't like the acting and think that modern actors are ""better"". I think the older actors aren't better or worse, just different. The audiences of the 1940s expected a certain style of acting, and the directors and actors gave that to them. Then as now, Hollywood paid top dollar and got very talented people, but like all of us they were shaped by their own time and place, more particularly the requirement to make movies that audiences would like. Move Maureen O'Hara to 2004, or Tom Cruise to 1947, and you'd see them acting in the style of that decade.",N/A
777,Notorious,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0953671/,"I'm a big fan of Hitchcock movies, and was expecting Notorious to be in the same genre as North by Northwest and Charade---and I was initially disappointed. However, I watched it again and fell in love with this movie!The plot, if you take the time to think about it, is amazing. Also, it's pretty risqué--everything about it. Bergman is absolutely superb--as is Cary Grant. Ingrid Bergman should have won an Oscar for her performance. Every line is classic and I've ended up seeing the movie three or five times. However, if you're up for a thrilling movie at home w/friends or at a party, this wouldn't be the one. I wouldn't say this is the type of movie for a romantic date either...it's in its own category where you just have to watch it with true classic film fans.",Notorious
778,Notorious,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1488153/,"Hitchcock introduces his stars with a cinematic blow that makes the opening of this dark, scrumptious thriller a monumental treat. He uses their star personalities and turns them round to dislocate us, teasing us with his unmistakable touch. The absurdity of the plot becomes totally plausible and the suspense is not merely unbearable but thrillingly entertaining. All of Hitchcock's favorite emotional and visual toys are present here. The icy blond, the sexual tension, the weakling villain with a castrating mother. A legendary kiss and a happy ending. Whenever I meet someone who hasn't seen any Hitchcock movies - and there are people in this world, believe it or not, who hasn't - I show them Notorious and always without fail, they are hooked forever. Just the way I was, I am and, I suspect, will always be. Cary Grant is allowed a dark unsmiling romantic hero and Ingrid Bergman lowers her strength to become a woman in love and in jeopardy but unwilling to appear as a victim. This gem of a film can be seen again and again without ever becoming tired or obvious. I'm sure you guessed it by now, this is one of my favorite films of all time.",Notorious
779,The Big Sleep,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0033712/,"This classic of American cinema, actually made during the war and released in 1946, got a whole nation of young men affecting Bogey mannerisms, raising their eyebrows or showing their teeth while grimacing, and especially pulling on their earlobes while deep in thought, a smoking cigarette dangling between their lips. It was the genius of Howard Hawks, who directed, to do everything possible to make Humphrey Bogart a matinée idol, including having Lauren Bacall slump down in the car seat so as not to tower over him. With this movie a new kind of cinematic hero was created, the existential PI, a seemingly ordinary looking guy gifted with street smarts and easy courage, admired by men, and adored by women.Hawks fashioned this, part of the Bogart legend, with a noire script penned by William Faulkner, et al., adapted from Raymond Chandler's first novel, that sparkled with spiffy lines, intriguing characters, danger and a not entirely serious attention to plot detail. Hawks surrounded Bogey with admiring dames, beginning with the sexy Martha Vickers who tries to jump into his lap while he's still standing (as Marlowe tells General Sternwood), and ending with the incomparable Lauren Bacall, looking beguiling, beautiful and mysteriously seductive. In fact, every female in the cast wants to get her hands on Bogey, including a quick and easy Dorothy Malone, bored in her specs while clerking at a book store. Hawks also employed some very fine character actors, most notably Elisa Cook Jr., and Bob Steele, the former as always, the little guy crook, (Harry Jones), and the latter, as often seen in westerns, the mindless heavy with a gun (Canino). Charles Waldron played the world-weary general and Charles D. Brown was the butler.I was reminded somehow of the old Charlie Chan movies with the dark, mysterious, ornately-decorated interiors heavily carpeted and studded with ethnic statuettes, especially the house on Laverne Terrace that Bogey keeps coming back to, and the glass-paned doors and glass-separated cubicals of his office and others. The atmospheric L.A. created here has been much admired and imitated, cf., Chinatown (1974) and L.A. Confidential (1997), two very superior movies that continued the tradition.In comparing this to the book, I have to say it's a little on the white-washed side, and not as clearly drawn--'confused' some have said. Of course liberties were taken with Chandler's novel to make it romantic. Chandler's novel emphasizes cynicism, and romance takes a back seat to manliness and loyalty to the client. An especially striking difference is in the character of General Sternwood's younger daughter, Carmen. She is vividly drawn in the book as something of monster, a degenerate sex kitten who would try and do just about anything. She is twice encountered butt naked by Marlowe, once in his bed. Being the sterling guy he is, he turns her away. (Right. I could do that.) Another difference is in all the sleazy details about the low-life underworld of Los Angeles that are omitted or glossed over in the film, including Geiger's homosexuality and his gay house guest, Carol Lundgren. (Of course there was a code in those days.) Bacall's character in the movie is actually a fusion of Vivian and Mona Mars from the book, made nice for movie fans. In the book, Marlowe kisses Vivian, but turns down her invitation for more intimate contact. In the movie, of course, there is no way Bogart is going to say 'no' to Bacall. In the book Marlowe seems to prefer whiskey to women.Most of the sharp dialogue comes right from Chandler's novel, including Bogart's grinning line, 'Such a lot of guns around town, and so few brains.' Interesting is the little joke on Bogart in the opening scene. In the novel, Chandler's hero is greeted by the purring Carmen with the words, 'Tall, aren't you?' Well, the one thing Bogey ain't is tall, and so in the movie Carmen says, 'You're not very tall, are you?' Bogart comes back with, 'I try to be.' In the novel, Marlowe says, 'I didn't mean to be.'By the way, the film features Bacall singing a forties tune and looking mighty good doing it.(Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book ""Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!""

780,The Lost Weekend,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1143825/,"***** SPOILER IN FIFTH PARAGRAPH ***** It's hard to imagine what people must have thought upon seeing this movie in 1945, depictions of alcoholism are so prevalent in our media today that it's practically a brand name. We have serious drunks, comical drunks, pathetic drunks, and all manner of drunks in-between. In many ways we may have progressed but I'm not sure I've ever seen a movie that treats alcoholism with the honesty it gets here.But The Lost Weekend isn't just a message movie, it's superbly crafted as well, easily the equal of Billy Wilder's other films (Double Indemnity, Sunset Blvd., Stalag 17, Sabrina, etc.). According to the production notes Wilder read the novel by Charles R. Jackson and took it upon himself to convince his producers to let him make the film, knowing it would be a hit and win the leading man an Oscar. That's vision coupled with uncanny film-making skill.Ray Milland never gave a finer performance, the progression of his character throughout the movie is extraordinary and a lesser actor simply wouldn't have been able to pull it off. I doubt he was Hollywood's first alcoholic would-be writer, but he certainly raised the bar for the many who'd follow in his footsteps. He never once resorts to stereotypical ""drunk"" stock-character. His eye movements and high-flown, self-delusional, speeches alone make the film worth watching.While this film is imminently deserving of the four major Oscars it scooped up (Best Picture, Best Director, Best Screenplay, and Best Actor) it didn't win for Best Cinematography, which is a shame. John F. Seitz's black-and-white cinematography is a visual feast. Seitz was nominated for the Oscar seven times between 1930 and 1955 (including four Wilder pictures) but regrettably never won. In all he was the principal cinematographer for 159 films, including such other classics such as: Sullivan's Travels, This Gun for Hire, The Miracle of Morgan's Creek, The Big Clock, Night Has A Thousand Eyes, and When Worlds Collide.***** DANGER! SPOILER AHEAD! ***** I'm not nearly so optimistic about Don's recovery as most other reviewers seem to be. Overtly the the Hollywood ending is all there; Don drops a cigarette into a glass of whiskey, he and Helen have the big kiss, he sits down to finally crank out his big book. Call it pessimism but I think it's all tied up so neatly that it can't help but unravel for him five minutes after the cameras leave. I see plenty of potential for more weekends just like this one, and I think that's the way Wilder wanted it.",The Lost Weekend
781,The Lost Weekend,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0032698/,"I take exception to previous comments that call the film ""daring for its time"" or ""dated"". It's still a very powerful film and there is nothing dated about the theme of a man who loses his soul to the bottle. It was a landmark film in its time and still is--there is no question about its holding power and the excellence of writing, acting and direction. Yes, even by today's standards! It outclasses more recent films dealing with alcoholism as it focuses on one man's problem with the bottle--a problem that affects all of the people whose lives he touches--particularly his loyal girlfriend (Jane Wyman in one of her best roles) and Philip Terry as his more conventional brother. The emotions are stark and real. The pity we feel for Milland's character is also mixed with disgust for his weakness. It's an accurate depiction of an alcoholic's struggle for the next fix--a never ending search for the next bottle. The pseudo-babble of a previous commentator attempts to inject disdain for the film as outdated and outclassed by more serious works. Nonsense! This was a stark and powerful film in 1945 and I have news for you--it is just as powerful and timely today! No other American film comes close to it. It is as searing an indictment of alcoholism as you are ever likely to see and Milland fully deserved his Oscar.",The Lost Weekend
782,The Philadelphia Story,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3474553/,"... and IMHO just about a perfect romantic comedy. C.K.Dexter Haven (Cary Grant) had a short stormy marriage to Tracy Lord (Hepburn). Now she is about to marry George Kittredge (John Howard). Haven and Lord are old money elite. Kittredge is a guy who pulled himself up by his bootstraps...and he won't let anybody forget it. You never really know WHY Dexter agrees to help infiltrate and therefore sabotage Tracy's second marriage. You never know if he intended to try and get her back -from the opening scene it seems their parting was pretty acrimonious. Or maybe he just knew that Kittredge was a drip and didn't want Tracy to suffer a lifetime of..well..being dripped on. At any rate he convinces the Lords into allowing two reporters from ""Spy Magazine"" to cover her wedding because the magazine publisher has a story all ready to go about Tracy's father's affair with a chorus girl if that coverage is not allowed. Since Haven, although he doesn't need the salary, works for the magazine too, this allows him to get back into the Lord household and do his best to ruffle Tracy's feathers. Tracy's problem and the reason that her first marriage broke up was her inability to see her own moral weaknesses while pointing out everybody else's. Tracy is completely to the manor born. When she discovers that one of the reporters (James Stewart as Macauley Conner) has written a beautiful book of poetry she asks him why he works for a cheap tabloid magazine instead of writing his own material. His reply is that he has to eat, and this answer rather stumps her. There are many complicating factors. Tracy's dad is off with his mistress, so the Lords try to pass their uncle Wllly off as Mr. Lord to the reporters. When Tracy's dad returns unexpectedly they try to pass him off as uncle Willy. The two reporters (Stewart and Ruth Hussey) have some kind of low key romantic understanding, but then Macauley begins to become attracted to Tracy. Add alcohol and almost code busting complications and insinuations ensue.It really holds up today as a genuine romantic comedy and comedy of manners in which everybody displays authentic behavior and reactions in spite of that pesky production code. The only thing archaic and even somewhat repulsive is how Tracy's father tries to make his affair with the chorus girl all Tracy's fault. He tells her that when a man has a daughter that loves him in spite of his faults he doesn't go looking for that in his golden years in another woman. I wonder if Chelsea Clinton ever had these problems? But I digress.Let me just say one thing about James Stewart's Best Actor Oscar. Stewart was wonderful as a working man captivated by a woman from another world, who discovers that the rich are not all jerks, but he was definitely not the lead. This was Grant and Hepburn's picture all of the way. The only thing I can figure is that the Academy felt that they did Stewart wrong the previous year by passing him over in Mr. Smith Goes To Washington, and were making amends.I highly recommend this to anyone. If you are not into classic film and would like to be, this is a perfect place to start.",N/A
783,The Philadelphia Story,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1062189/,"A movie custom-made to fit the personality of an arrogant but headstrong movie star, a play with dialog that sizzles with so much ferocity that it threatens to leap out the confines of its own frame, performances that could not have and have not have been excelled ever since, THE PHILADELPHIA STORY is one of the best screwball comedies ever made and the third to pair her with Cary Grant with whom she worked so completely well. Hepburn had asked that Tracy and Gable be her leading men but looking at this film, for all the chemistry that Tracy and Hepburn ever had and all the talent Gable had for acting in comedic farce, I can't imagine either of them playing any of the two leading males that are after Tracy Lord's love. That Grant plays C. K. Dexter ""Dex"" Haven so perfectly well, and his opening scene with Hepburn is the stuff of movie history, only rectifies that. That Stewart embodies the essence of MaCauley Connors as if he were in fact the character just proves how strong an actor he was, and one who didn't have to resort to extreme emoting to make his point. That the three make for the most memorable romantic triangle in film history is probably an understatement.Of course the story is old. Of course the character motivations are dated. THE PHILADELPHIA STORY belongs perpetually in its own time, the late 1930s (when it was written and performed on stage), when sensibilities towards the rich were much different than they are today. The whole bit of the society princess being humbled to become a better person is really a thinly disguised fable that tells the story of how Hepburn, who had made such a powerful debut in film with her appearance in A BILL OF DIVORCEMENT, quickly established a personality so abrasive (she wouldn't do interviews or cheesecake, it is rare to find a Hepburn picture from the 30s where she is dolled up) that it translated into box-office bomb after bomb and by 1938 she was all but washed up. Tracy Lord's return to humankind is really the story of Hepburn's return to the world of acting even if she retained her abrasiveness to her last days. And of course, who better suited for this role than Hepburn herself, who had done the role on stage and by the time Hollywood came (reluctantly) calling -- they wanted Norma Shearer, who in my opinion could have carried it off but differently -- knew the part in and out (and owned the rights to the play in a shrewd move). We can't imagine anyone else playing this role, which is why when the inevitable musical remake was made in 1956 with Grace Kelly in the lead, it misfires, and no amount of Cole Porter could save it even if it was a commercial success.But regardless being dated, maybe too talky for some, what a movie. To see the utter craziness of the plot which backfires at least twice and creates a sense of really not knowing what will happen next (even when we know on a certain level Hepburn and Grant will wind up in each other's arms) is the stuff romantic comedy is made of. Oscar nominated in almost every major category, it won two -- Best Actor, Best Adapted Screenplay -- but over the years it's grown beyond statuettes and remains as one of the greatest films of the 20th Century.",The Philadelphia Story

At times I felt like it was hard to understand what the actors and actresses were saying. I also thought the story was going to be more interesting but I found it quite dull. The actors and actresses in the story didn't entertain me as much as some of the other screwball comedies I've seen from this time period. Their punch lines weren't delivered very well and weren't effective. I wouldn't recommend other people go out of there way to see this movie.

785,His Girl Friday,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0021873/,"This screen adaptation of the Ben Hecht and Charles MacArthur play ""The Front Page"" was adapted for the talents of Cary Grant and Rosalind Russell -- there is no such character as Hildy Johnson (Russell) in that play.Director Howard Hawks wanted to show the whirlwind pace of the newsroom in the criminal courts system so he had his actors overlap their lines -- so much so that at times it seems as though everyone is talking at once; it even gets difficult to understand all that is going on.He also had the cast move FAST so the film looks totally frenetic from scene to scene with no respite -- either from the laughs or from the action.There are two really good ""inside"" jokes in the script: The first is where Walter Burns (Grant) is describing Hildy's fiancee and says that ""he looks like that guy in the movies -- Bellamy,""  Well, it WAS Ralph Bellamy playing that part!The other is when Burns says something about someone he once knew named ""Archie Leach"" which just happens to be Cary Grant's real name.This is one of the true gems of Hollywood's most prolific era.  It has incredible pacing, acting, photography and an authentic gritty feeling that would be associated with hard-boiled, ""anything for a story"" newspaper people.It has long been one of my favorite films and deserves to be watched over and over again -- just for all the dialogue and great acting that may have gone by so fast you missed it the first time.",His Girl Friday

793,Raazi,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4174296/,"Raazi does what very few Bollywood movies do right. It pulls off a tight script with good acting, and a realistic believable storyline that leaves you on the edge of your seat for two hours. The film also manages to maintain a tight pace while building up towards an impactful climax. In particular, I think three things made it unforgettable: Firstly, the acting was on point, and made the movie what it turned out to be. Alia Bhatt is turning out to be an absolute genius, and has come a long way from her 'student of the year' days. There are very few in her peer-group that can do justice to these kinds of roles. Vicky Kaushal was good as the beguiled husband, and his restrained yet emotional male character (supporting a powerful female lead) is a Bollywood rarity, and was thoroughly enjoyable. The others are on point too, with minor actors like Jaideep Ahlawat and Rajit Kapoor delivering strong performances. Secondly, the movie turned out to be tight and on point, with no melodramatic displays of emotion or sappy songs. The good old premises of a bride departing to her husband's household for (presumably) good, the arranged marriage with a virtually unknown man, and eventual marriage consummation were all present, in theory. These are all typically perfect opportunities to inject unnecessary bridal parting songs, lengthy wedding song and dance sequences (boy's side, girl's side, etc.) and the worst of all - a song balancing sleaze with ""Indian culture"" (read: censor board mandated restraint) that plays when the marriage is consummated (this is typically a couple kissing and rolling around in a bed, carefully clothing their privates with velvet or satin sheets). But Raazi eliminates all of this fluff and more, leaving you wishing more movies would do away with the crap in favor of keeping the pace of the plot. Lastly, and most importantly, Raazi does justice to the complexity of the India-Pakistan conflict. The countries have a shared history which makes the war painfully more unique (e.g. Abdul, the oldest and most faithful caretaker in the Pakistani household is of Indian origin). The movie takes no sides, and shows you that humanity and ruthlessness exist on both sides. This is a significant departure from the patriotic films of yesteryear - we are habituated to seeing a good vs evil theme, and having Pakistanis depicted as soulless warmongers. And so, you are simply not prepared to empathize with Iqbal's (Vicky Kaushal's) gentle persona, and when you do, it his vulnerable humanity hits you like a truck. Conversely, the hardened Indian intelligence agent Mir is many things during the movie, but 'human' he is not. I walked away from the theater understanding better the nature of such wars, and that the real conflict is not over Kashmir, or between two sides, or between ideologies. The real conflict is always fought within the human heart: between the ruthless imperatives of duty, and the very human urges of gentleness, mercy and love.",Raazi
794,Sound of Metal,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6455201/,"Riz Ahmen is Ruben, a drummer in a hard rock ""band"" (which is just him and his girlfriend, Oliva Cooke). They share a strangely quiet, gentle existence living out of an old Air Stream and travelling the country. Their music is loud and angry; their lives are restrained. We learn that Ruben is a recovering addict and we soon learn that he is suddenly and quickly losing his hearing. It's a devastating diagnosis. To lose his hearing is to make who he thinks he is (a drummer & overall musician) nearly impossible. He is encouraged to go to a home for newly deaf adults who are also addicts. (One of the faults of the movie is that we aren't told exactly why or how this decision is reached. One day, he's just going there.) Ruben works to fit in and gradually finds a place for himself. But in the back of his mind, all this is a ""holding pattern"" while he tries to come up with the funds to get a cochlear implant to regain his hearing.Ahmed is never less than amazing. The awards season recognition he's getting is well-deserved. He is pretty quiet through most of the movie, yet never totally peaceful. He is a deeply decent person, even gentle...yet he has demons he must wrestle with. Ahmed can convey these battles and contradictions just by sitting there and letting us see his face and eyes. You can feel how cheated he reckons himself to be. You can see when he's drawn to simple things like teaching a deaf child how to drum his hands rhythmically. You can see his battle to contain his anger and confusion. His first ""AA"" meeting at the center, where everyone speaks in a sign language he hasn't begun to learn yet, is quite arresting because you can see how overwhelming it all it, yet he barely moves. His performance is worth seeing, 100%. (I would also point out that the sound design is EXCELLENT and so critical.But the events of the movie are shown so frustratingly. We have no real idea of how much time is passing? When he learns sign language, has it been a week or a year? Olivia Cooke's character (and performance?) give us almost nothing to go by. We initially like her because Ruben does, but we really don't know her at all, and the script and actor give us little to go by. And strangely, as arresting as Ahmed's performance is, I found myself not actually caring all that much about how everything turned out. Key events in the character's journey seem to be skipped. Major plot points (and there aren't many) are presented in a sketchy manner. It all led to a movie that feels like less than the sum of its parts.By all means, see if just for Ahmed's performance. But I think the film itself is SO specific (a rock drummer addict who is suddenly deaf and must adjust but also wants surgery because he thinks it will be a cure-all to return him to his old life) that it forgets to clarify things that those of us who haven't had this specific experience are sometimes left in the dark. It's an overall miss for me.",Sound of Metal

What story is it! It's not about Dunkirk, the famous WWII evacuation of British troops from France. What about the French troops? The British commander says to hell with them. Two cowards are the focus of the story. They will do anything to get out ahead of everyone else who are patiently waiting, keeping order, and waiting their turn. One other is picked up by a civilian boat on its way to rescue troops at Dunkirk, and he fights the crew to not go back. He kills one of them. Great story? I figure they used 5 planes to make the entire film: three RAF fighters, one German fighter, and one German bomber, all classic planes. Why I say this is b/c they only show three RAF fighters in one scene, and then it's always a one-on-one with all the other scenes. The special effects are from the 1950's. I think they did a better job in Wings, 1927. Also, it's hard to figure out what they are saying. I missed half the dialogue, but I didn't miss much b/c it's so worthless a film. It's aimless, boring, pathetic, and cheap. There is nothing epic about this film. It's a sad joke. What a waste of my money. It's one of the most over-rated films of all time.",Dunkirk

799,Hidden Figures,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4746737/,"In 1961, three Black female geniuses ( Katherine Johnson, Dorothy Vaughan, and Mary Jackson) work for NASA. We can tell it's 1961 by the ubiquitous pictures of JFK. The three work as human computers doing calculations.Katherine is a mathematician who is basically Einstein without the crazy hairdo. Mean White people are mean to her. They mistake her for a janitor, make her drink coffee from a separate pot, and worst of all, force her to walk half a mile in the rain while carrying a bunch of folders, just to go pee.
Sheldon from The Big Bang Theory is particularly mean to Katherine. He's always trying to take credit for her work. Katherine is clearly the smartest person in all of NASA.
Kevin Costner is Katherine's boss, who destroys the colored bathroom sign, thus freeing up her genius and enabling her to get John Glenn into orbit. John Glenn was in his forties at that time, but the actor playing him looks like Scut Farkas from A Christmas Story. NASA probably would've had to shut down if it wasn't for Katherine. Sheldon ends up subjugated to Katherine and serving her coffee.Dorothy is a mechanical genius who can fix cars just by magically touching the engine with a screwdriver. Kirsten Dunst is mean to Dorothy, and won't let her get a promotion. When NASA gets a new computer, (that is too big to fit through the door), the White doofus programmers don't have a clue how to get the thing to work. Dorothy can get the computer functioning just by magically touching a wire. Dorothy gets promoted to supervisor and gets to act sanctimonious towards Kirsten Dunst. Dorothy is clearly the second smartest person at NASA.Mary is an engineering genius who can't get promoted to engineer because of mean White people. She has to go to court to fight for the right to go to engineering school. The mean White judge really doesn't want to allow her admission into the school, but Mary wins him over with sassy Black girl attitude. I believe she later went on to invent the internet. Mary is clearly the third smartest person at NASA.Hidden Figures is a plodding, predictable, Howard Zinnesque soap opera of Whites oppressing Blacks, which is mostly fictitious. The three women really existed and really did work at NASA. But all they did was work in groups doing tedious calculations in pre computer times. Katherine Johnson stated that she was treated well and didn't face any discrimination. This film is nothing more than post ""Oscar so White"" agitprop.

800,Paddington 2,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3857911/,"I used to read all the Paddington books when I was a small boy and my wife when she was a little girl. We both loved all the crazy escapades that Paddington got into and he did it all with a good heart.I very much enjoyed seeing the first Paddington but did feel it wasn't quite Paddington with the scary woman and the scary scenes.Paddington 2 completely captures the essence of the the books and really wrings out the most of some of the characters.Brendan Gleeson is superb as the 'nasty' Knuckles who quickly warms to Paddington. This might sound far-fetched but the whole film is very childish. Now that's not childish in the sense of ""silly and immature"" but in the other definition of ""appropriate to a child"". The whole film shows and plays scenes as a child might imagine things to be - for example how the prison works and especially the lovely idea that the warden reads the inmates a bedtime story to help them all get to sleep.There are superb performance from all the actors and a huge number of cameos. Even the small scenes put in by the like of Joanna Lumley and Rob Brydon are clearly done with great love from the actors. Hugh Grant puts in a superb over the top performance as the baddie, which really let him flex his vocal talents!The whole film is done in bright colours and with a superb musical backing track. When you are watching the film be careful to pay attention to all the small details, such as the newspaper headlines and the To Do list in the Brown's Kitchen, there a huge number of little jokes in the background and I suspect I'll spot a whole load more when I watch this again on Blu-Ray!Not really spoilers but there is only one really 'scary' scene near the end but it is so beautifully done and you know that Paddington will win so even the little ones won't cry. And make sure you stay for ALL the credits as they play out to an amazing ""what happened after"" montage.I have noticed that that at the time of writing this review there were 927 votes and 15 people have given the film a 1-star. Now I know everyone is entitled to their opinion but in this case I suspect these people might not really understand Paddington and what he's all about, if you have young children and they love Paddington then they will love this film.This film is suitable for young children aged 4 to 104 :)Let you into a secret, when my wife and I went to watch this film there were a lot of people in the cinema but not one was under 18! From the looks of it the audience was aged 20 - 80!I cried and I laughed through the whole film and rekindled my inner Paddington.",Paddington 2

How is it that the evil and all powerful grandfather turns into a meek half blind feeble old man with no memory? Where did his 2 aunts go? And why were they wearing masks the whole time? Something must have actually happened as his parents did die so this story was not just a fantasy the boy was having about his cranky grandfather.

804,Manchester by the Sea,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3614022/,"Our hero is an angry man who can't seem to hold it together. Through a series of flashbacks we learn why: a great tragedy has traumatized him. But this is not just any tragedy, I can't think of anything worse that could happen to someone. Oedipus Rex plucks out his eyes with less cause. So there is plenty of motivation for him becoming an angry loner, but his past could motivate any dramatic outcome, celibate monk, mass murderer, iconoclastic artist, CIA assassin, raving lunatic. Call a suicide prevention hot line with his backstory and they might direct you to a right-to-die website.Psychotherapy is apparently never an option in the townie macho culture the film depicts; the local police have a very strong reason to get him counseling, but there is no indication they ever do. Self-medication with alcohol is the only succor he gets. OK, so I understand why our hero is angry, but why are most of the other characters attempting a Boston accent so touchy? The accent-free characters in the film never get upset. Despite the portentous music, the film's front story is not so tragic. (A different score could turn this glass-half-empty downer into a half-full feel-good charmer. Some film school should do the experiment.) Our hero realizes his limitations and makes some reasonable choices. The brilliantly acted and Oscar-headed moment when his ex-wife tries to help made me wonder just how she managed to get over it so well.An inability to control his fists is our hero's one shortcoming. Watching a seething Casey Affleck staring out his late brother's bedroom window, my immediate reaction was at least he isn't punching his fist through the glass, and then, a second later, he does. No angry-male stereotypes were harmed in the making of this movie.My takeaway? Check your smoke detectors regularly.",N/A

Otherwise it just hindered the character development, audience attachment to the characters and the ability to understand the timeline and plot. Really disappointed as I thought I would love it. I also found it to be an inaccurate depiction of society at the time. I've read Little Women and the language they used in the book was much more old fashioned. This is set in the same time period as Gone with The Wind to put it in to perspective for you.

813,Pride,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3181544/,"I have just watched this film and on a personal level it affected me greatly. I was a young gay man in 1984 and I and friends, travelled to both the 84 and 85 Pride marches in London. I remember the Miners support at the 85 and we were greatly touched at the time. The movie got the details exactly right, I and many of my gay friends were on lots of marches including the ones against Clause 28 the evil Tory piece of legislation that outlawed promotion of homosexuality in schools and publicly funded museums and art gallerias (among others).What I want to say about this film is that young gay and straight people should see it. It is immensely moving and funny. Just the right balance. I wept throughout and laughed because it brought to life my youth as I lived it in protest against that evil woman and her kind who dared to tell us how to live our lives, and who we couldn't legally love. It was scary times, AIDS, homophobia and arrest for protest.I probably can't be objective because of my involvement as a youth in gay protest, it brought raw emotions to recall how angry we young people were then. But more importantly for me it reminded me like it was only yesterday of the immense Pride we felt at fighting for our rights and anyone who was a victim of hatred and prejudice.All of the actors were a delight, and the portrayal of working class solidarity spot on and very emotional. I loved the fact that it had that British humour that is so peculiar to this country. The details were very true to the time, I recognised the clothes, the music and how tatty gay clubs were with peeling paint on the walls. It is a film that brings to life a time that has not been portrayed before, of protest, solidarity and how together we can change things.I'm glad that such a film can be made and successful in this country now as a mainstream film as well. Maybe that shows that the protest of our youth changed things. I can get married now if I wish and thanks to a Tory PM, who'd have thought it? So one big thank you to all involved for making this 50 something gay man remember so vividly, and in spite of the dark days portrayed, our youthful struggle and reminding us that we really did something wonderful and change things, as this film is proof positive that we did just by the fact that is got made.I hope that young gay people, who still cope with the same problems we did, isolated, alone, and scared can watch this film and gain strength from it and join the fight against prejudice still to be won.",Pride
814,The Past,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2919633/,"In the first scene, a French woman (Marie) greets his Iranian husband (Ahmad) at Paris airport. While there is emotion expressed in body language, they communicate through the thick glass that separates them. In the rest of the movie, all characters (having different nationalities) live under the same roof of a small house that is under renovation. Farhadi symbolically used these decorations to describe his characters. The key characters of this universal drama have a lack of understanding and miscommunication (like between Marie and Ahmad) while they are emotionally integrated. Their sophisticated personal lives evolve (or renovate!) during the short period of time, during the story. There is no white or black character and the viewer has the chance to decide which side is right.Asghar Farhadi already won the Oscar for best foreign language film and hence expectations are high, and I believe that he almost gets there. Similar to his previous movie, the drama has a precise plotting, turning around divorce. However, the drama includes surprise features more than just cause and effect. In many scenes, the characters claim that they know what is in mind of the third person who is absent in the conversation. This is interesting while the film intentionally does not reveal the certainty of those mindsets and there are a few scenes with a certain message (like the opening).Cinematography, the movie has an advancement compared to Farhadi's former masterpiece, A Separation, and the Cannes festival recognized this difference.

I am baffled by the great reviews for this film. I presume the people who gave it high ratings are either unsophisticated film fans or people who have been sadly deprived of true cinematic art.

This haunting soundtrack replaces the need for dialogue and adds intensity to Servillo's melancholic performance.Servillo's acting is superb from his moments of dry humour to the heartbreaking intensity of those feelings he cannot quite hold on to. La Grande Bellezza gives a window into Roman life that is probably only fully understood by a fellow Roman.

From here on, Chaddha's days and nights are spent in convincing Vicky to become a donor till he finally gives in. Vicky finds his love interest in Ashima Roy (Yami Gautam), a pretty Bengali girl, who works in a Bank. But soon their hunky dory world comes crashing down because of Vicky's past as a donor. With a brief emotional roller coaster ride, Vicky Donor is a light-hearted take on the subject of sperm donation.What to look out forSparkled with exceptional performance by Annu Kapoor as Dr. Chadda and the wonderful debut by Ayushmann Khurrana as Vicky Arora.. Vicky Donor is a fertile entertainer with focus to tell an endearing love story centered round sperm donation glory..John Abraham deserves a special pat for not following bollywood trends as a producer and opting for a out of the box subject on sperm donations for his debut as producer and not using his stardom and making way for a newcomer for a wonderful debut.. highly remarkable..Shoojit Sircar grows immensely as a story teller and shows vast improvement from Yahan (2005) to Vicky Donor. With the all round support of his writer Juhi Chaturvedi he captures the mood of Delhi in light, funny and tangy first half then giving us those genuinely stirring moments rather late in the game and ending up with a sweet note.All this wouldn't have been possible without the active support of Yami Gautam who makes a beautiful debut.. Watching her is treat to your eye and the girl delivers a sparkling performance.Dolly Ahluwalia is excellent as mom and Kamlesh Gill as the grand ma is outstanding.. Whenever she appears on screen she eats up other actor's presence. Jayanta Das as Yami's father is adequate.Music and dialogues are in sync with the film. Pani da song is the pick of the lot.. editing is sharp and other technicalities are fine. Production values are up to markWhat NotVery difficult to find but some conservatives might not like the conceptConclusion: Vicky Donor is avant grade cinema that is fertile at the Box Office. Those who complain Bollywood for running out of ideas.. 'Vicky Donor donates sperms of hope.. a must watch..",Vicky Donor

824,English Vinglish,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2684678/,"Many will know I have been following Bollywood films over the last few years with keen interest, with one of the prime reasons being, why not? We have dedicated halls and screens which are always showing the latest the industry has to offer, very often having same day premieres, and I cannot fathom having to close this option off for the lack of language ability. English subtitles is a boon, and my only option to understand what's being said on screen. English is of course the plot element here in this film, written and directed by Gauri Shinde, who has made a film that's strong in heart, and powerful in performance.I'm talking about Sridevi's comeback to cinema, having retired some 15 years ago to raise her kids. And this leave of absence surely helped her in her protagonist role here, but more on that later. For those unaware, like I was previously, Sridevi is arguably the best actress Indian Cinema has produced over the last few decades, and it is only today that I fully understood why. Her performance as Shashi, the traditional Indian housewife, is impeccable, and the littlest of nuances put into her role, reaped results in the manifold. As a line of dialogue described, her eyes are like coffee drops in a saucer of milk, and that in itself is an understatement.Charisma is something that you have, or have not, and Sridevi's presence is something that arrests your attention immediately when she comes on screen. Carrying the entire movie, it's unbelievable to think that she's pushing 50 already, as her performance here will probably inspire many actresses of today's generation sit up and take note, to realize that they still have a long way to go to reach a fraction of her level. I'm sold, impressed, and very eager to catch up on her filmography to see what more she had to offer during the 80s and 90s when she was at the peak of her popularity then.Her comeback in English Vinglish is a casting coup for its filmmakers, and let's not forget Shinde's story which was custom fit for her as well, playing the role of a mother, which probably made it quite an easy transition back to the industry. But it's an important role because one of the key takeaways from the narrative, is how we often take those who love us for granted, and as part of the process, inadvertently hurt them too. We may not realize it, or sometimes we do, but these hurt will likely be the worst possible. A callous word and a careless comment go a long way, and is difficult to, or sometimes cannot be taken back.It's something many of us have been through and experienced, regardless which side of the equation one was on, where respect does not get accorded, and where words go out to make others feel small about themselves. In Shashi's case, this happens to be her lack of command in the English language, perceived to be an ability of social status, made quite unbearable when her children thinks it so, and when her husband (Adil Hussain) also gets in on a private joke with their daughter.The film's story worked on many layers, and what I especially admired is how Sridevi becomes the spokesperson for lessons without being too overt about it, save for the ending speech that hammers in the emotion, and is sure to make your eyes well up. It deals with, on a macro level, how as humans we should be helpful and tolerant to those who don't speak our language or understand our culture, that one shouldn't be made to think one's superior just because, or make the other look small. And on the more micro level, the structure of the family and its importance. All these and more, told through a story about a woman finding her inner strength to stand out, stand up and be counted, building and reinforcing confidence that she's more than just a Laddoo machine.But social factors aside, the more obvious ingredient that's put into the movie, is the Mind Your Language type scenes when Shashi enrolls herself into an English crash course to learn conversational English in four weeks. Instead of Mr Brown, there's Mr David (Cory Hibbs) the teacher (whose sexual orientation again highlights the differences in the human race and the need for tolerance and acceptance), and a motley crew of classmates from various parts of the world bonding together. From a woman who centered her life around family, building a network of friends became something of a lifeline of sorts, in keeping life interesting through the sharing of experiences, and of course, food.English Vinglish has everything a typical Indian film contains, from comedy to romance - handled with such maturity - culture and language. What more, it has Sridevi's remarkable return, showing why she was, and still is, one of the iconic female actresses ever to grace the screens of Indian Cinema. A definite recommendation, and though formulaic at parts, is delivered with such slickness, that I'd shortlist it as one of the best this year.",English Vinglish
825,The Wind Rises,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2840463/,"The announcement of this film was a pleasant surprise after Ponyo and From Up on Poppy Hill, which both had simple, childish plots. Few films in Japan have tackled the lives of imperial period heroes; the ghosts of the 1960s urge people to denounce what really happened in that time and memorialize an imaginary anti-war movement, for example in this year's film ""Shounen H"". For Miyazaki to choose a subject like this showed that he was really going for a huge challenge. Miyazaki is of course anti-war and environmentalist. But Ghibli films are never negative. What sort of positive image of the Zero bomber inventor would Miyazaki produce?The result is astounding. As everyone has noted, this is not a children's movie. It's complex, so it doesn't have the epic sense of Miyazaki at his best, but history and adulthood are just as complex, and Miyazaki does justice to both. The film indeed stays positive throughout, by showing from start to finish how everyone wishes they themselves would behave, rewarding the viewer with virtue and beauty, but without being condescending about the hardships of real life. In a sense, the film is about the ""importance of dreams"", but it's also about what it means to be a dreamer in real life, and how our highest fantasies can be turned into beauty if we put our minds to it. The cartoon medium is put to full, extravagant use in dream sequences that merge right into the narrative. Certain elements at the end of the film leave the obvious unsaid in a peculiarly Japanese and fulfilling way. The most classic films of Japan, like the great works of Akira Kurosawa and Yasujiro Ozu, say something profound about the meaning of life, and Kaze Tachinu deserves a place among those ranks.",The official title of the movie is Kaze Tachinu

I'm a guy who usually doesn't cry in movie theatres, heck it's a rare sight to see me crying, but I was bawling at the end. They did leave it to make other films, which I hope that they do, but if they left it like this I wouldn't be sad, because it closed all the emotional doors that needed to be closed, for me personally, and even opened some I had never knew could open before.

Actually, it's not even the sad ending of the story that bothers me, but the poor execution of it.

But for me, that's not enough.I found the story-line quite predictable. I also found the characters to be flat and mostly unlikeable.The acting is amateurish. The only two who gave great performances were Frances McDormand and the actor who played Scoutmaster Ward. Even Bill Murry and Bruce Willis were not at their best in this film. The child actors were dull and disingenuous. The plot moved slowly causing me to yawn frequently.

830,Moonrise Kingdom,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2614681/,"Let's try to understand the miracle I have just witnessed. Director Wes Anderson is 12 years old, has just experienced his first love while at Summer camp, and immediately rushed to a camera to tell us, his pen pals, the story. A slightly embellished story which follows the perfect scenarios we would draw at night in our beds at this age. It has all the tiny details, the sense of adventure and the freshness of youth. How someone 43 years old in real life could do this movie is beyond me. The drawback of this miracle for the viewer is that such a jump back into the kind of idealized feelings you had in your early teens leaves you with quite some melancholy when you leave the cinema.It could be that some people do not connect to the movie and just see it as ""adorable"" or ""cute"" and nothing more. But I suppose most people will feel connected, notably because the movie has this straight-to-the-point attitude in both the technique and the story-telling; the story is read to you, not force-fed with dramatic music and whatnot. Just like one of the characters who reads bedtime stories to the others.You might complain about the lack of character development for some of the big names in this film (Norton, Willis, Murray - McDormand less so as she gets more detailed screen time than the others) but I suppose this is wanted: kids will see hints of the issues adults are facing, but can't understand them fully.

Hiccup keeps talking about peace, but all of his efforts come down to 2-3 clichéd sentences, while most of the time he ends up waving his sword around in a very video-game style. The movie actually makes it clear that there is a possible way to stop the fight, but then completely ignores it and goes on to focus on power struggle.All the emotional moments are extremely clichéd, uncreative and feel ""cheap"" and sugary. They make a huge part of this movie. Not much humor, either.The very beginning was good enough - relaxed, cheerful and I thought a few minutes of friendly banter between Hiccup and his girlfriend were nicely done, felt natural.

The tonal shifts that follow are so dramatic at times, it's hard to rally connect, with anything or anyone. The teacher delivers her story with such flippancy that it's hard to tell if this is real. Nakashima's style suits the happy-go-lucky type films he's used to, but here the slow motion is gorgeous but intrusive. Representing something so complex as a series of vignettes results in a patchy and grim effort. It builds towards a climax that seems very out of place, due to the distance kept between us and the characters.

835,I Saw the Devil,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2449821/,"Many reviewers who give this movie a good rating assume that most critics are put off by the violence and the bloodshed and then proceed to support their appreciation for the movie by explaining that one needs to look through the (apparently necessary) gore and appreciate the deeper layers of the movie. Well, I wasn't necessarily put off by the gore, although I don't appreciate gore for the sake of gore (I don't like the Saw movies). I think Old Boy was an excellent movie for example. That movie went far beyond violence and gore and covered themes like pain, loss and revenge in a wildly original, meaningful way. 'I saw the devil' attempts to do something similar (at least, that is what I assume), but it fails miserably. The acting is actually quite good, Min-Sik Choi and Byung-Hun Lee are very capable actors, without any doubt. And the story starts off very promising. There's a good build up the first 45 minutes, but after that the story unravels into an inconsistent mess within no time. I deduct that the supposed moral of the story is that revenge cannot heal the inflicted pain, even if you try to live out your revenge in installments. And that in the end revenge backfires and the moral borderline between victim and perpetrator starts to dissolve. Fair enough, I've seen less illuminated morals in movies. But the execution of the idea undermines the whole purpose. A couple of examples: GPS-capsules are solid poop-proof and only flush out with diarrhea? And exactly at what level of mushiness does the capsule decide to go for the exit? These may seem like trivial questions, but are essential to the story development. And mind you, Kimchi tends to be pretty spicy. The first time the serial killer is set loose (temporarily) he happens to catch a ride with two killers (with a dead body in the trunk) - oh, what a coincidence. And of course he kills them, in a moving car. The secret agent discovers the 3 bodies, but somehow this does not convince him that his gamble to keep the serial killer on the loose may harm innocent bystanders (or are we supposed to believe that he knew they were killers and that justice was somehow done, despite the fact that he should know that the killer doesn't just have an appetite for 'guilty' victims as he butchered his fiancée). Many more people end up dead or traumatized because of this gamble. And don't tell me that his hatred and urge for revenge have already completely taken over his rationality and morality at that point - why then proceed 1,5 hours to portray this disintegration? The other cops are supposedly completely incapable and do nothing to stop the carnage. Our cop gone rogue uses his cell phone a number of times to call with the police but they have no way to track him down? Despite the fact that they have GPS capsules with microphones in their arsenal they cannot track down a mobile phone? And even when they meet him at his father in law's house they don't apprehend him? Moreover, when the serial killer decides to surrender to the police, about 50 cops are waiting at the agreed meeting point. Then, our rogue cop comes driving by and while driving pulls the serial killer (waving a knife) into the car and abducts him. And the other cops just stand by, doing nothing. What? All 50 cops came on bicycle or using public transport and cannot pursue a driver who is struggling to subdue a serial killer with a knife while driving? And so on, and so onI'm willing to accept a (tiny) bit of illogicality, coincidence, inconsistency and even plain stupidity in a movie, but a movie should not be build on that. At least, that is my humble opinion. The rating this movie gets on IMDb shows that most viewers don't agree.",I Saw the Devil
836,The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2544510/,"I really was hyped too see this as David Fincher is one of my favorite directors, but this movie seemed pretty unnecessary to me.The movie is pretty much a re-thread of the Swedish movie same plot, except that the ending dragged on more than the Swedish movie.Rooney Mara is good as Lisbeth and so is Craig as Blomkvist but they don't have the chemistry that the actors in the Swedish movie have.The dialog seems pretty forced at times and I think this movie might have been better if it have been set in the UK or in the US, instead of having mostly British/American actors speak with awful accents.My biggest question is why does this movie even exist it is completely unnecessary.This movie falls in the same trap as many Hollywood adapted movies, it builds up a more hype and falls flat.My verdict if you have not seen it go see the Swedish version, it's way more stronger as a whole.",The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo
837,Captain Phillips,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2934346/,"""Of the crooked timber, no straight thing can ever be made."" - Immanuel KantPaul Greengrass directed ""United 93"" in 2006. The film was marketed as an ""apolitical"" and ""objective"" account of the September 11th attacks, but was devoid of all historical context, and so functioned more as a Pentagon propaganda piece. Here was a film about a handful of state assisted Saudi Arabians attacking at least 3 high profile US buildings which totally ignored the United States' relationship with Saudi Arabia, totally ignored how these attacks were used as a pretext to launch two illegal wars, totally ignored US ties to Al Qaeda, the group purportedly behind the attacks (on the very day of 9/11, the US were collaborating with Al Qaeda within the Macedonia civil war), and totally ignored both the motivations behind the attacks and what certain Saudi's stood to gain from another Western crusade. To this date, the 9/11 Commission, the White House, FBI, CIA and British government have failed to provide proof (not garnered from water-boarding) that Al Qaeda carried out 9/11 or that Al Qaeda chieftain Osama Bin Laden masterminded the attacks, let alone that these groups or individuals constitute the governments of Iraq and Afghanistan, the two countries upon whom wars of retaliation were subsequently waged. Osama Bin Laden was killed in 2011 (again no evidence was presented to the public). In 2001, before the US invasion of Afghanistan, the Bush administration turned down offers by Afghanistan's Taliban groups to turn Bin Laden peacefully over to US authorities.Like ""United 93"", ""Captain Phillips"" revolves around a vessel being hijacked. Here the Maersk Alabama, a Danish/American container ship, is boarded by four armed Somali pirates. The pirates battle with the Alabama's crew, before escaping with the ship's captain (Tom Hanks) aboard a lifeboat. The United States Navy then arrives. They surround this lifeboat with a small fleet and proceed to assassinate three pirates. The fourth survives, and is subsequently jailed in America. Captain Phillips survives.Whilst Greengrass obviously sympathises with both his Somalis and the crew of the Alabama, you simply can't frame a film as a thriller, or depend heavily on the US Navy loaning you a flotilla of aircraft carriers and destroyers, and not expect it to be anything other than compromised. This is ultimately a film in which the Somalis are manic bad guys (high on drugs, no less), in which the Alabama's crew are good guys ""delivering aid to Africa"" (most of their cargo wasn't relief aid), in which all context is ignored and in which the US Navy does ""murderous but wholly necessary things"". The film is matter-of-fact to a fault. This is all there is to reality, it says. Accept it.But as everyone knows, to the point of being smugly annoying, that is not ""all there is"". The Somali pirates are largely a result of Western companies dumping nuclear and toxic waste off Somalia's coast, coupled to severe illegal over-fishing by foreign super trawlers (300 million dollars worth of seafood stolen from Somalia each year). The United Nations would itself release numerous reports blaming toxic waste for mutations, deaths, diseases and illnesses within Somalia. Ahmedou Ould-Abdallah, the UN envoy for Somalia, would say: ""There is uranium, lead, cadmium, mercury, industrial, radioactive, hospital and chemical waste killing Somalis and completely destroying the ocean."" Why can companies do this? Because Somalia's government has all but collapsed, thanks to Western Empires deliberately destabilizing and developmentally arresting the nation, funding warlords, dictators (Siad Barre et al) and instigating proxy wars with border nations. This has been going on, uninterrupted, since the late 1950s; any local government body not beholden to Western corporate interests, and which attempts to nationalise resources, will be destroyed. In the early 2000s, Somalia began to fight back. To oppose US-backed warlords, right-wing religious factions began to unite, some under the name The Union of Islamic Courts. The UIC united almost all of Somalia and provided stability, but was nevertheless swiftly demonized by the West – their unwitting creators - as ""Islamist terrorists"". Because the CIA solves everything with bullets and blood, the US and UK then pushed its Ethiopian puppets into invading Somalia. Tens of thousands died and the UIC was pushed back. Tired of all this crap, and forged in a cocktail of anarchy, the militant group Al Shabaab was formed, partially to fight off Western and Ethiopian gangs. Today, they are US public enemy number 1.Whilst Greengrass undoubtedly intends his film to be a work of social critique, possibly like some of his earlier pictures (""The Green Zone""), ""Captain's"" narrow scope hampers things. You can not tackle such a loaded event in such a constrictive manner and expect it not to set up, intentionally or otherwise, many false assumptions. One senses Greengrass attempting something approaching satire – the idea of a film in which a zillion dollar US fleet is absurdly pitted against four lowly pirates who literally struggle to ""climb to the top of a (socioeconomic?) ladder"" is genius – but satire is completely beyond him. Juxtaposed scenes in which Hanks and our pirates talk about ""fighting for promotions"" feel, for example, reductive rather than enlightening.Beyond politics, the film is tense, well shot, but also repetitive and overlong. The casting of Hanks brings dubious (and possibly ironic) connotations, Hanks the poster boy for a post-John Wayne Americana (""Apollo 13"", ""Private Ryan"", ""Band of Brothers""), genteel but packing heat. Philosopher Jacques Ellul once predicted that future propaganda would increasingly portray itself as being ""apolitical"", ""naturalistic"" and cloak itself in ""realism"". Greengrass' military-men are emblematic of this shift: grim, stoic and fixated on ""just doing their jobs"", everything forever outside their purview and moral radar. Greengrass' camera adopts the same stance.6/10 – Wastes a good premise.",Captain Phillips
838,Captain Phillips,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2944658/,"That went a lot higher than my expectations. I was thinking an okay movie, but that was more than just okay. Truly impressive powerful thriller.The movie's strength points could be summed up:1. Greengrass's thrillers are really fine, I like his The Bourne Ultimatum with his shaky camera tricks. And here he is doing it again maybe with different techniques. As a thriller, Greengrass managed to make this movie get on your nerves and put so much tension, and that's a success.2. The Somali crew.. Now, that's some serious impressive sh*t. Some Somali dudes you have never seen their faces in a movie before come and make such spectacular performances, that's something you should admire. It made the movie so believable that you'd sometimes forget it's just a movie. Barkhad Abdi has made a huge step in his career with this movie and that was crowned by his nomination for the best actor in a supporting role. He probably won't get it, but he deserved it.3. Tom Hanks is just a really fine actor. He was driving the whole thing with his convincing performance. I still can't believe he got my tearing in that scene, or let's just say crying. Greengrass has taken him to squeeze some fine acting skills.4. Fair screenplay that didn't make you forget that justice should be done, no matter how the conditions the person lives in, but it also pushed the eyes to take a look into the world that would produce such people as pirates.",N/A

I have to admit that after seeing this movie I was overwhelmed with dismay. It is true that the media and the movie critics have been slanting the news to trap us into seeing this film.Alas what a boring film!.From the beginning to end,this documentary movie about five black rappers failed to impress me.Off course this movie deserves a fair NC17 rating,but the explicit sex and the bad language did not offend me since I am an adult.What I strongly hated about this movie is that it indirectly promotes racism and hatred against black people for in this movie are represented as ruthless and immoral rebels .Sorry to tell you that (Straight Outta Compton) is a movie you should avoid if you do not want to waste your time and lose your money.",Straight Outta Compton
842,Straight Outta Compton,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3303175/,"I've been writing reviews for IMDb for ten years, and I think something fishy is going on here. STRAIGHT OUTTA COMPTON is getting very, very high reviews from the vast majority of IMDb reviewers -- but the nine and ten- star reviews are all getting pelted with ""negative"" marks, earning scores of ""1 out of 15"" likes.So what's the problem? The problem is that this movie wasn't supposed to be a hit. The mass audience wasn't supposed to respond to the story of young black men facing oppression and coming out on top. The American people were not supposed to see the real truth about how their police treat minorities every day. Quick, let's bury the good reviews! Let's spawn a phony backlash! Let's discredit Dr. Dre and Ice Cube on the basis of things they did twenty years ago. Oh, and let's all get sentimental about Eazy E because he's dead, and young black men are okay once they're dead. The dead ones are no longer scary and threatening. The problem with this movie is that the people who made it actually dared to portray young, angry black men as heroic, not as criminals or predators. It's okay to glamorize white criminals, because Hollywood was built on that. From PUBLIC ENEMY to THE GODFATHER, white audiences have always loved to sentimentalize their own criminals. But you can't do that with black men who rap about crime, even when they aren't actually criminals themselves. When Cagney postures like a thug in some ancient piece of crap that's cool. But when black men do it today that's dangerous and irresponsible!There are very powerful elements in this country that are terribly frightened by this movie. They're frightened because this movie gets white audiences to see young black men as something other than dangerous criminals. The scenes of NWA being roughed up by police are a terrible threat to the powerful elements in our society, who stay in power only by keeping white people scared of black men. They can't tolerate the idea of black male victims, so they instantly start a media backlash portraying the victims as criminals.I say this is a good movie, a powerful, exciting film that presents a side of American life that is almost never seen on the screen. I know I'm not going to get many likes for this review, but what the hell. I've got enough already.",Straight Outta Compton
843,Mother,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2299426/,"Before watching this film I got online and read several reviews like I always do, to get a feel about what i'm about to see. From what I read I was very excited about the film, several people were comparing it to Hitchcock and saying what an incredible thriller it was, and many people praising it so highly, that after a few pages of reviews I thought I was preparing to watch a cinematic triumph. Well, I have NO idea what all those people were talking about... it's not some great thriller or mystery, it's not even a good thriller or mystery...I kept reading about all these great twists, none of which I found were much of a stretch. Now don't get me wrong, it wasn't a horrible movie by any means, it had some bright moments...great performances, some good humor, cool cinematography, but I'm just warning you, don't go into this movie believing your about to see some great mystery thriller, or you'll be greatly disappointed...when it ended, it was one of those "" you got to be kidding me"" moments.",N/A
844,Mother,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2134390/,"It's too bad that because this film is ostensibly about an old lady it must be considered a ""smaller"" film in Bong's oeuvre. It's not. It is every bit as brilliant, and as large, as Memories of Murder, in my opinion.In many ways this is the natural, and equal, follow-up to Memories of Murder. It's every bit the caper film that one was, and, although slightly more somber in tone, the film keeps unraveling in directions you don't expect making it much more a plot driven movie than a character study. Kim Hye-ja is, however, magnificent as the titular (gawd I hate that word but I'm using it anyway) mother. There is a scene in this film where she tells the family of the victim her son didn't do it and her eyes are so electrically charged it made me jump back from the screen. Mother fires on all cylinders. The direction, cinematography, script, and acting are all grade A. It's one of those films where each of the secondary characters steals the show for a brief period. (How 'bout that cop who kicks the apple from Won Bin's mouth?) Bong does a remarkable job of populating the world of this film with real people and manages to give them depth and development in a very short period of time. I confess to having a little trouble tracking the other female characters in the film, but no matter. There is a scene (without spoiling anything here) where Kim Hye-ja asks the other 'retarded' kid if he has a mother and it's one of the most complex and heart-rending scenes in cinematic history. Hyperbole notwithstanding, just freakin' WOW! on that one when you ponder just why she is crying.I wasn't sure where Bong was going to end up going as a film maker. Barking Dogs Never Bite was a reasonable debut. Memories of Murder, a masterpiece. But was it a lucky shot? I'm glad I don't have to consider the dismal Antarctic Journal a Bong film if I don't want to. The Host was lots-o-fun, but that's the one that worried me. Maybe he was going to start making blockbuster type films. But now, after recently seeing his contribution to Tokyo!, and now Mother, I have every reason to believe he is going to kick my butt with interesting film for a long time.",Mother

All the characters are shown to be defying common sense things, creating ridiculously unbelievable situations. For example, the cops and the pimp are trying to search the victim bodies but they do not start from where the prostitute's car is parked.Similarly, even though the killer has confessed to the killings, the cops do not find it important to pursue the leads.

I don't mind if a director deviates from their source material, provided that the film works. However, I felt, as I watched, as if someone was patting my back, and picking my pockets.There are some beautiful scenes: butterflies flying from the treetops of Mirkwood, Smaug gradually revealing himself, etc. Nevertheless, the visual virtuosity is wasted, because the scenes have no emotional impact. The characters are undeveloped, and barely interact with each other. There is no tension, no texture, no warmth. The story feels as fake as the over-the-top special effects.The screenplay is insultingly bad by any standard. If you consider that it was adapted from the masterpiece of a world-class philologist, it's a crime against culture.If I had to summarize the film, I would call it a juvenile, tasteless, video game-like action sequence. Take the barrel riders scene. A dwarf rolls along the shore in a barrel, knocking orcs off the screen, exactly like in the Donkey Kong Country games. Meanwhile, Legolas and Tauriel, in god mode, with unlimited arrows, and a perfect aim, are slaughtering hundreds of orcs. I felt my brain cells dying as I watched.In conclusion, I left the theatre feeling violated. The film, to an even greater extent than its predecessor, embraces three things I despise about Hollywood: catering to the lowest common denominator, showcasing special effects at the expense of storytelling, and blatantly treating filmmaking as a business rather than as high art.",N/A

849,The White Ribbon,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2128556/,"Admittedly, I was underwhelmed at its conclusion. I knew it was something great, especially in construction and visual prowess, yet I couldn't shake that feeling of clouded mediocrity. And then, after talking about it with my friend for an hour or two afterwards, it hit me. Haneke has intentionally filled our minds with detail upon detail, setting up conspiracies and unsolved mysterious, leading us to believe things only to plant clues that refute them. Looking back, I found that each second stuck in my head; I couldn't shake even the minutest detail because it might hold the key to solving this puzzle. Deaths, tragedies, and accidents are happening every day, possibly connected, but how? Our narrator, the town's schoolteacher played by Christian Friedel, is relaying the events that occurred before being sent off to fight once the Archduke Ferdinand is assassinated. He believes the strange attitude and mysterious activities all began with a freak accident of the doctor. Riding his horse back home, he is thrown off when its legs trip on a wire spanning two trees, causing a lengthy hospital stay to recover. Next come a death, a kidnapping, and a beating, all unsolved despite hunches and hypotheses going through the town. Something is in the air, but what it is and what will come of it is unknown.The children are the key to everything. They are the easiest to blame, as it seems they are always there by the tragedies. Definitely hiding something, the kids begin to stare authority in the eye and practice what has been preached. Haneke mentions in an interview attached to the press notes that he wanted to show the sort of ""black"" education going on at the time, breeding Fascism and terror. Good and evil fall to strict black and white, every action has a reaction, a punishment to set things right. The children are of an age that they are beginning to understand that life is not eternal, there are consequences in their actions and the adults are not afraid to tell them so. When you don't follow the rules, you will be caned, (a brilliant scene showing the young siblings enter the room, but allowing the audience to only see the closed door during the abuse), and you will have to wear the white ribbon in order to show the world your transgressions and need to earn back the right to be free, (the precursor to the Jewish stars perhaps?).What about the adults? What about those practicing adultery, or abuse of power, or destruction of property, or sexual abuse with a child? Who has the right to punish them? When, after the second kidnapping and beating of a young boy, a note is found stating intentions, that the children of transgressors will be discipline for four to five generations, you start to see the severity of the actions—as well as allusions to the Holocaust and the mass genocide of an entire people, rooting out the ""evils"" of the world by excising the entire population, killing the bloodline at the source. But it can't be the children, right? They are too young and innocent, unknowing of the world set before them. Yet with the upbringing in this town, treated as adults with responsibilities and accountability, anyone would grow up fast. Cause a raucous in class and be chastised; be the leader and stand in the corner. Forgiveness is a liability. When the oldest girl, and leader of the wolves if you believe the children are the monsters, Klara, (wonderfully portrayed by Maria-Victoria Dargus), is ready to accept Communion, her own father, the pastor, (a menacing man of authority realized by Burghart Klaussner), pauses, contemplating whether she deserves it. You know he doesn't want to give in, family bond means nothing.Haneke has woven a tapestry of intrigue that will keep you on edge throughout. The anticipation of a solution is palpable, and the fact it is never released makes this film so riveting and unforgettable. The payoff is that these children will grow up into the generation that becomes the Nazi party, making this sleepy rural town a breeding ground for young Fascists that will change the world. Retribution is being taught, atoning for ones sins practiced. World War II is after all an answer to the punishment inflicted on Germany after the first, isn't it? It's a cycle of getting back, proving one's pride, and seeking revenge upon the children of the enemy if the enemy itself is unavailable. God's will has to be upheld and that intrinsic fact is ingrained in the minds of the youth. When Martin, an effective Leonard Proxauf, is discovered walking along the railing of a high bridge, he responds to the yelling of the man that finds him with the line used to title this review. If what he was doing was wrong—we can only infer on his role in the incidents occurring around him—then God would have let him fall, paying for his sins. But the fact that he gets to the other side unscathed only proves his work is that of the creator of man. Haneke says he had another name for the film, God's Right Hand, and I think it would have been just as appropriate a title. A powerful film, sharing so much information without any answers; it takes our mind into overdrive, trying so hard to find a reason for it all. But sometimes there are none; sometimes bad things just happen. You can only speculate and hope to prevent them from ever happening again.",The White Ribbon

It preaches to the liberal progressive choir, of which I'm a card-holding member, and it decides that such things as nuance, subtlety, or even slightly different points of view are unnecessary clap trap and offers us instead the admittedly cathartic experience of a two-hour shout of outrage at our messed up culture. But hoo boy, is this movie pretty ridiculous. Even while I was being entertained by it, I knew I was being shamelessly manipulated, which I could tolerate for a while, but the end of this film, which plays against one of those blaringly self-righteous movie scores, would make even Steven Spielberg cringe.This movie is as watchable as it is because of the actors, and though there are many fine performances in this ensemble cast, I have to single out Mark Rylance, as the defense attorney for the 7, who deserves an Oscar for trying to make a serious movie out of Sorkin's superficial pap.Grade: B- (This is one of those movies that feels like an ""A"" while you're watching it, but sinks lower and lower in your esteem the more you think back on it).",N/A

When asking students what they thought of this film, 95% of the answers I heard went something like this: ""It was so sad. That little German boy died, and he didn't even belong there.""

When I heard they were making the book into a film, I was very anxious, as I thought that they couldn't possibly convey the book onto the screen appropriately. I am delighted to say that I was entirely wrong. I have just this minute returned home from seeing the film and I am absolutely stunned. The film is practically identical to the book, which was wonderful to see, and I thought that the acting was superb. Vera Farmiga and Asa Butterfield were, I thought, exceptional. The film was handled fantastically and I believe that the feel of the novel was not lost in the translation to screen. Seeing the film was a lot more intense than reading the book and, even knowing what was coming, I found myself sobbing at the end, as were my father and step-mother, the latter of whom had never read the book, and was utterly shocked. This is the first film I have ever seen in which the whole audience were silent from beginning to end, and then, when the film ended, not a single person moved for a long time afterwards.

857,Once,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1656224/,"(My Synopsis) A Guy (with no name - Glen Hansard of the Irish band Frames) is singing his heart out on the streets of Dublin for tip money. One day a Czech Girl (with no name - Marketa Irglova) stops to listen to the Guy play his music. She is very impressed by his songs and she asks if he wrote his own music. The Guy says that he writes and loves to play his own songs to himself even if the street crowd wants to hear other music. It is nice to earn tips, but that is not what his music is all about. The Guy lives at home and helps his father repair vacuum cleaners, but he has a dream of becoming a recording star. His girlfriend of many years has just left him and is now living in London. You can tell what this has done to his emotions, because it is being reflected in his new songs. The Girl who happens to have a broken vacuum cleaner also has a musical background of playing the piano and writing songs. Their music brings them together and the Girl begins to help the Guy realize his dream. They begin to share their music and their feeling for each other. They put together a band with other street players and rent a recording studio for the weekend to record two demos. This could be the start of a new and wonderful life.(My Comment) The storyline is almost like a reality TV show. The people are not actors, and they are naturally doing things in their lives that they just want to do. This is not your typical Hollywood movie as to the ending and especially the costs. The writer/director John Carney made the film in 17 days for an unbelievable $130,000. John Carney did not have the expensive steady cam cameras, but he used hand held cameras with telephoto lens so he wouldn't have to get a permit to film in Dublin. You will notice the movement of the pictures and hopefully it will not give you motion sickness, because it gives the film a raw feeling which in turn makes it feel real to the audience. Hansard and Irglova are charming together and very supportive of each other. All three people were at the screening that I attended, and they had a Q&A session and sang 4 songs after the movie. The three have been friends for many years. That is why I said that the movie is like a reality TV show, where friends got together to make music. Hearing them perform live after the movie, I recognize that it was the same performance that I saw on the screen. Now as for the music, personally, I liked some of the songs, but most of the music was not the type of music that I would listen to on the radio. Overall the film will give you a unique experience and realism that we normally don't get out of Hollywood. (Fox Searchlight, Run time 1:25, Rated R) (7/10)",Once - Official Title of the movie
858,Once,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1671095/,"I write these for friends and if you love movies you are a friend: I saw a movie last night that was so good that I have spent the last hour looking up information about it on the Internet Movie Data Base and related links. I have included the Fox Searchlight website for the movie at the bottom of this review so you can hear the music. So now I know that is was made in 17 days and at a cost of less than $150K and reflects a Dublin of 10-15 years ago when Dublin was much poorer and more working class.And, I would be much poorer in life and spirit, and my heart, like most of us, covered in scar tissue from life, would not seem so vulnerable and new, if I had not seen this movie. A simple story of a street musician in Ireland, singing covers during the day for Euros, and his own music at night for cents. A verging on middle aged man, still living with his Da, repairing vacuums in a tiny shop and writing songs to his lost love in his tinier bedroom. Approached by girl, an immigrant, who loves his songs, understands the pain that gave them life, and soon they are in a music shop with the girl playing the piano and together they prove that art isn't produced from big budgets or green lit by ten vice presidents and that seventeen days and a pittance can make me get goose bumps just trying to write a review of what I saw in a dark theater with ten other people in a complex dominated by Shrek, Pirates, and Spiderman.I knew a woman once who only read novels about unrequited love. What a wonderful phrase: unrequited love. Archaic, unrequited, love, universally known and unknown, and as a friend said about the movie and its songs: no great art came from happiness. But the movie isn't sad, it's pulsing with life and music and incident and the process of how art is made. I have always been a sucker for movies about how art is made: Shakespeare in Love, Topsy Turvey, as examples, but in both those, art that was known. In Once, on the streets of Dublin, an Irishman and a Czech girl, remind us of how, to my generation, the guitar was king, a guitar, bass, drums and piano a symphony orchestra, and there was no power like the power of rock and roll. In all generations, love sought, found, lost, and sometimes regained is the stuff that brings us to the theater, to the book, to the movie.I'm in the midst of reading a book by an Irishman, a detective novel, the hero a reader, and the author uses the book to list books he likes: from one...'the body moves on, the mind stays and circles the events of the past.' This must be true of the writer/director.You won't forget these people. I can't forget their songs. We should all meet, my movie loving friends, and talk about this movie in a bar in Chicago I know that has great music on the jukebox, cold cold beer, and is dark enough so we would all look good. Neil Young sang: only love can break your heart, Once asks 'how often do you meet the right person', and as fellow movie goers I ask how often can the right movie be made, shown in your local, and break/make you heart at seven of a beautiful summer's eve? It's the best movie of the year. Maybe of the last five years. But, I am not a dispassionate critic, I loved it.",Once
859,The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2718922/,"I was convinced the (many) criticisms I read beforehand were exaggerated and wouldn't bother me. To my surprise, quite some criticisms seemed justified in the end ...***THE SCRIPT***ADDITIONS: On paper, the additions looked like a great way to create added value. However, while I understand why they included them, they all feel out of place.Opening scene: Ian Holm just looks too dissimilar from his appearance in FOTR (especially his haircut), which is really distracting. The frame story doesn't blend in naturally and the history of Erebor has too much to show in too little time.Radagast: He appears as suddenly as he disappears. His scene in Dol Guldur really threw me out of the movie.The White Council: I know the screenwriters want to underline the growing dark powers (hence the - preposterous - finding of the Morgul blade), but the empty talk about things of which we all know how they've played out in the LOTR films isn't convincing at all.Azog: An appallingly one-dimensional character, who feels most out of place (the fact that he looks like a creature from a cheap horror movie also doesn't help ...). His scenes have a strange ""un-Tolkien"" vibe, particularly the battle of Azanulbizar (the worst scene of the movie), which doesn't feel like a fierce and thrilling battle at all.FROM THE BOOK: The episodic structure prevents the film from having a fluid narrative and squeezes the tension out of every new dangerous situation: the events just leave you cold.In the book, we experience everything through Bilbo's eyes, which creates a strong connection between the reader and the main part. This is missing from the movie: Bilbo even seemed to have more or less disappeared between the troll encounter and the stone giants' battle. His homesickness, his doubts, all of this isn't really developed in the script.The emphasis on Thorin is a good thing, but also not perfect: during the enclosure by the Wargs, I didn't buy Thorin's charge towards Azog and especially Bilbo's sudden ""action hero saves the day in the nick of time"" intervention. The latter seemed like a very inappropriate way to illustrate Bilbo's courage.There were actually only two great scenes: Riddles in the Dark is amazing, but ironically, it also painfully shows how mediocre the rest of the movie actually is, because this is the only moment that comes close to the level of LOTR. Also, Bilbo's speech after they've escaped Goblin Town is a very welcome, for rare touching moment.***THE PACING***It's quite astonishing some people complain about the pacing, because the film was over before I knew it. In fact, I think the pacing is about just right and proved it would have been really difficult to adapt the book in just one fully-fledged movie. But since I didn't like the additions, I'm doubting whether a third film is necessary after all (but I suspend my judgment until 2014).***THE CINEMATOGRAPHY***One of the biggest (unpleasant) surprises is the cinematographic style. I'm not talking about the bright colors or the digital images, but the (lack of physical) camera use. Whereas LOTR has stunning ""real"" camera movements and an extremely accomplished ""handicraft"" feel, AUJ often feels like a video game. The camera is flying and whirling so limitlessly that it just doesn't feel like an authentic movie anymore. This is particularly apparent during the Orc chase and above all the absurd Goblin Town escape. The CGI is perfect, but too much is just too much.***THE MUSIC***After my long list of complaints, I'm truly relieved to say there is at least one thing that unconditionally gets my support, which is the score. The people who unfairly label Howard Shore's work as a ""re-hash of LOTR"" obviously didn't pay full attention, because when you listen to the score multiple times (and I admit it also took me several spins to really appreciate it), you discover a new rich and diverse musical tapestry once again masterfully woven by Shore. OF COURSE you hear the same themes when EXACTLY THE SAME places are visited as in ""The Fellowship of the Ring"" ... If someone deserves credit for ""The Hobbit"", it's Shore: his music is in my view the only aspect of the movie on par with the level of LOTR.***3D & 48 FPS***The 3D was good, no complaints about that. However, although I have no problems with watching movies in 3D, I start questioning its necessity.I am bewildered many people claim that 48 fps creates a ""TV-look"" with ""actors with clear make-up on a fake set"". I didn't have that feeling at all, but on the other hand - and this was the most surprising - the difference with 24 fps isn't THAT spectacular. After 30 minutes, I even had to remind myself: ""Oh, I'm watching 48 fps, right?"". Yes, the images look very clear and it does smooth fast movements, but the latter (which is positive) only sticks out a couple of times (and no, the motion never comes across as ""sped up"", so I was never distracted by the higher frame rate). All in all, I consider 48 fps to be an improvement over 24 fps (without diminishing the ""cinematic"" look of a film), but I didn't have the feeling I had witnessed a ""revolutionary new cinema experience"".***** CONCLUSION *****I didn't expect (or want) a replica of LOTR, but while ""The Hobbit"" isn't a bad movie, it isn't good either. I'm still perplexed I don't feel any urge to go see it again, unlike the LOTR films. We can only hope that Jackson recovers in time to save the next two films from unnecessary additions, lack of focus on Bilbo and a video game feeling. Well, at least we have new brilliant music to listen to!",The Hobbit

861,The Edge of Heaven,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1794567/,"(1) The single quality of this movie, as with all great art, is ""what is NOT said/shown"", but what the viewer has to make up in his own mind. This being a German movie, could it also be necessary to go back those 30 years, when Susanne (Hanna Schygulla's character) went hiking to India, so mid- to late 1970's. Could she have been this bit leftist-leaning person ? This could explain her resolve finally to support Ayten - after the EU/Turkey argument - and also the break-up with the completely absent husband, Lotte's father (only hinted at in the phone booth sequence). (2) The ""Bayram/Abraham's sacrifice"" (starts at scene one !) is the key underlying the film and uniting the countries and the characters: /SPOILER/ every one of them is responsible for killing whom he/she likes most but you can repent already ""on this side"".",N/A
862,The Edge of Heaven,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1916173/,"I usually comment on films right after I've seen them. However, ""Auf der anderen Seite"" (The Edge of Heaven), touched me in a way that few films do, so a month has passed. This story of two sets of mothers and daughters, a father and his son...and a gun seems familiar, but its resolution is anything but. To lay out the plot would be daunting. So much ground is covered, yet it unfolds effortlessly. F a t i h Akin's screenplay is elliptical--the story starts where it finishes--but by the end, when the opening scene is replayed, our journey with these characters puts us, indeed, on the edge of transcendence.Amid the desperation on display, small details brim over the images: a son waters his father's tomato plants pausing to taste the ripened fruit, a mother pits cherries that stain her fingers, another manicures her nails to avoid a quarrel, we imagine a bookstore's--specifically a German language bookstore in Istanbul--smell and the safety it can bring to a foreigner.... These domestic details are set against much larger, although finally insignificant, struggles: the cultural divide of immigrants, students revolting against an oppressive government, how imprisonment can deaden the soul. But F a t i h Akin wants the basic struggles of family bonds to be central here. It's the resolution of family rifts--small and large, emotional and physical--that are urgent.The choice of settings, music, lighting... all carefully selected to build toward one moment that catches us off guard. When a foreigner asks ""What is Kurban Bayrami?"" (a Turkish holiday) the many seemingly disparate elements that we've been watching--in good faith because they're so rivetingly told--suddenly come together, it almost knocked the breath out of me.Whether or not we as viewers have lost a father or mother or a child, through death, physical separation or emotional turmoil, we can understand what these characters suffer. And how all that can be healedthe willingness to have faith that good intentions can mend this troubled worldis something like a miracle to find illustrated on film. The weapons these characters lay down to pursue goodness don't necessarily have the effect they intend, but as we watch lives torn apart and then healed we see what they don't. And we carry that lesson out of theater with us.",The Edge of Heaven
863,Atonement,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1843657/,"The tragedy and poignancy of this wartime love story should've torn my sentimental heart out. But I found I was checking my watch repeatedly during the last hour since I figured out by then that nothing much of great cinematic significance was going to happen.A privileged and obnoxious precocious rich girl makes a false allegation regarding a decent and mildly likable working class man, and she is believed by virtue of her station in life, effectively ruining his life. This may make some deep statement about the entrenched class system in Britain, but this interesting point is never developed in favour of shallow Harlequin romance sappiness.I just didn't given a damn about anyone in this movie. Keira Knightley, despite her striking physical beauty, remains just as aloof and unlikeable here as in her incarnations of Elizabeth Swan and Elizabeth Bennett. And I expected I would identify more with McAvoy's character, as many if not most men hugely fear being misunderstood in relationships and thus vulnerable to vexatious allegations of sexual impropriety. But I found so little endearing in him--he by no means impressed me as the quintessential romantic hero who I wanted to get the girl despite ostensibly insurmountable obstacles.The Vanessa-Redgrave-as-Briony revelation at the end of the film was a mildly entertaining ""twist"", but still the fact that Robbie and Cecilia were casualties of the war before they could be reunited did not move me much at all.In short, it ain't Casablanca. The star-crossed-lovers-in-wartime thing has been done before Atonement. And it has been done better.Despite the invective of another review, I am very attentive to film music and I really liked the score. The incorporation of an old typewriter as a percussion instrument at points was striking and original and I really enjoyed it.The film really deserves a 6 (mildly entertaining and not a complete waste of time), but I give it a 1 in my attempts to offset the abundance of pathetically misguided reviews that are claiming to find cinematic genius here.",Atonement

I feel no connection to any of the characters or the acting. Gosling is this weird arrogant silent guy that we never learn much about. All the other characters are quite cliché. The coincidence is also pretty strange that Gosling happened to live in the same floor as the guy he wants to help with money problems is actually in dirty business with the guy sponsoring Gosling. Plus the movie is called ""drive."" I expected to see little more stunts than just unrealistic and unnecessary handbrake spinning in only one scene. The filming and setting were the only good things about this movie. Not even the music was catchy. I feel like I've been have a strange plot less and lifeless dream while watching this movie. NO substance at all and strange acting i will rate this movie maximum a 6.8. I don't understand what the hype is and why people are going crazy about it. It really is something just to pass time let alone a masterpiece. As if everything mentioned wasn't bad enough the violence is just downright ridiculous and again unnecessary.

It's suppose to be a gangstermovie but all they do is talk, talk, talk. Almost no action at all. Russel Crowe displays wooden acting which he has done in all his movies except from ""Proof of life"" and ""LA Confidential"". Denzel Washington doesn't look anything like the real Frank Lucas. He is way too handsome. And he plays the character too much like a nice guy and here is why that is a problem.I read an interview with the real Richie Roberts, who caught Frank Lucas, who don't understand why is Lucas represented as a good man in this film. According to Roberts, he killed more black people than the KKK, ruined several black families and he was a drug-lord. He was a murderer and a criminal, nothing more. And Ridley Scott makes him seem like a businessman who just happens to be moving cocaine and heroine.And the real tragedy of it all, was that Frank Lucas only got 7 years in prison, instead of the 70 years, he was sentenced to serve. Because he testified against cops that took bribes from him. And now, because of the movie he sees himself as a hero and a star. And that's how the audience will sea him as well. Nice going Ridley: you made a very, very, very long and really, really, really boring movie, making a murderer and a drug-lord seem like Martin Luther King.I know nobody will agree with me, but even the greatest moviedirectors in the world, makes bad movies from time to time and this is one of them.",N/A
867,American Gangster,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2675332/,"American Gangster is a biographical crime film directed by Ridley Scott and written by Steve Zaillian. The film is based on the criminal career of Frank Lucas, a gangster from La Grange, North Carolina who smuggled heroin into the United States on American service planes returning from the Vietnam War. It features Denzel Washington and Russell Crowe in leading roles,together with John Ortiz, Josh Brolin, Chiwetel Ejiofor, Norman Reedus, Ruby Dee, and Lymari Nadal in supporting roles.There was a time when no one noticed reserved driver Frank Lucas, but when the criminal kingpin he was charged with transporting through the city streets suddenly dies, Lucas seizes the opportunity to build his own criminal empire. In the following months, Lucas solidifies his status as Harlem's most innovative drug dealer by delivering a product that is purer than the competitors' and cheaper, as well. When innovative businessman Lukas attempts to go semi-legit by becoming one of the Manhattan borough's biggest civil supporters, however, street- savvy outcast cop Ritchie Roberts begins to sense a sizable shift in the hierarchy of the drug underworld. But Roberts is one of the few honest detectives operating within a corrupt system, and as he sets out to investigate the case, crooked detective Trupo does everything in his power to compromise the integrity of his idealistic counterpart. Upon clearing all of the usual Mafia-connected suspects, Roberts begins to believe that a previously unknown black power player has come out of the woodwork to dominate the local drug trade. While Roberts and Lucas may be operating on opposite sides of the law, the one thing that both men have in common is a strict code of ethics that separates them from their opportunistic colleagues. Now, as a confrontation between the two men becomes inevitable and the fate of each becomes inexorably tied to the other, it gradually becomes apparent that only one of them will emerge from the conflict victorious.American Gangster an epic, true crime drama, that although not entirely original in its premise is excellent in its execution.It maybe long at 157 minutes but immerses its audience with its twists and intricacies as it plays out and considers the logistics and consequences of crime and police corruption, with a plethora of show-stealing performances from the cast especially Washington's steely grip on his impersonation of Frank Lucas.",American Gangster

You'll enjoy the visual experience, no doubt.As for the story, some of the ""inspirations"" are so huge and so obvious that mentioning two or three of them would REALLY ruin the movie for you, and I'm not willing to do that. Lots of mysticism and ecology, if you like that stuff. If you're 15 or so, you'll have a great time thinking that it's the first time somebody makes something like this. If you're an experienced movie watcher, better leave your skepticism at the door, bring lots of pop corn and enjoy with the usual action-flick-with-moral-and-loads-of-clichés.I liked it, however: ""the movie that re-invents movies""???

It's also kind of a twisted version of Lola Runs.It just takes that ""what would happen if"" concept to another level (or is it dimension?). Every decision you make has consequences. The bigger the decision the bigger the consequences obviously. Which doesn't mean that small things don't matter.

I haven't seen too many art-house films, but I was pleasantly surprised by the tone which wasn't too serious, or pretentious. There were laugh out loud moments during a movie with themes concerning choice, destiny, and metaphysics.I was enamoured by the love story, it was feel good without being Hollywood.The visuals were amazing. I believe that Jaco explained that he used different DP's to film the different possible lives of Mr. Nobody. There were scenes set in the year 2092 that were absolutely stunning on the big screen.I found the soundtrack to be awesome.

The story is of a limply-functional family, whose good leg is dysfunctional, and of the way that their love for each other is solid, somewhere underneath the varying shades of crazy. This film. Oh, this film! I have never laughed harder, and at such true-to-life comedy--nothing silly or goofy or forced or fake about the lines. It felt more like watching a documentary (minus all the familiar faces) and every time the laughter became almost unbearable, a little dash of agony or melancholic sadness was thrown in, and spawned aching tears.

875,Hot Fuzz,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1596900/,"So here we have it, the eagerly awaited follow-up from the same team that brought us Shaun of the Dead. But whereas Shaun (hereafter shortened to SOTD) drew its inspiration primarily from zombie films (more specifically, George Romero's ""Dead"" films), Hot Fuzz throws its net a bit wider, taking in every buddy-buddy cop action film made in the last 20 odd years and combining it with a very British perspective. Think Midsummer Murder spliced with Bad Boys 2 and you should have the rough idea.Through a series of quick cuts we are introduced to Nicholas Angel (Simon Pegg), an outstanding officer in the London police force, a super cop with an arrest record 400% higher than anyone else. In fact he's so good, he makes everyone else look bad. So Angel is packed off to the picture-perfect village of Sandford, alone save for his beloved Japanese Peace Lilly. On arrival Angel finds it difficult to adjust to village life, constantly on the look out for crime in a place where there hasn't been a murder for over 20 years and the police station is so quiet that the staff spend most of their time eating cake and ice-cream. He also finds himself partnered with over-eager constable Danny Butterman (Nick Frost), the son of amiable Police Chief Frank Butterman (Jim Broadbent). Danny is obsessed with action films and believe's that Angel is his chance to live out his dreams of car chases and gunfights.With the set-up completed within the first 15 minutes it's on with the plot as people start to die in a series of grisly ""accidents"". Angel is suspicious but no-one believes him apart from Danny. With the body count rising though, the two need to work together to find out what's going on or could it be that Angel is just wound too tightly for country living? Pegg and Frost have been doing their double act for so long it's become second nature and it's nice to see them playing (slightly) different roles. Just like SOTD, they are ably supported by a cast of familiar faces from British film and TV. It's good to see Timothy Dalton having so much fun, playing the sinister Mr Skinner with a moustache-twirling relish. Other standouts include Paddy Considine and Rafe Spall as the Andy's, two detectives who spend most of their time verbally abusing Angel and Danny.The film is packed full of references, which I'm sure will take multiple viewings to catch. There's some inventively gory scenes which are sure to make everyone a bit more careful around churches and model villages, though they are a bit too obviously CGI. It's a shame that the action doesn't kick into high gear until the final third but with the plot not going down the most obvious of routes and since I was laughing all the way through I can't really complain. The film is a success in it's attempt to create a ""British"" action film, combining adrenaline-fuelled action with the mundane and everyday.",Hot Fuzz
876,The Curious Case of Benjamin Button,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2006248/,"I don't understand the appeal of this film. It has no plot (which is not necessarily a bad thing. Another Fincher/Pitt collaboration from 1999 comes to mind), the protagonist has no goal, and the film basically has no conflict.Massive Spoilers Below.Button is a FREAK. You would think his life would be a living hell full of torment and meaty conflict...but no. Button's life is wonderful. He rarely encounters hardship.He gets abandoned by his father, who shows up later and gives Benjamin everything he owns. He is taken in by a loving woman who cares for him every step of the way, keeping him far from anyone who would consider him to be a freak. He lives the good life growing up...or would it be down? He gets a job handed to him while sitting on a bench (a job that he loves so much that he would have done it for free, but he's getting paid!). He travels the world feeling no ill effects and not being taunted or ridiculed one single time for his disorder.Most difficult situation he encounters is being left without a life jacket when the tugboat encounters a German WWII sub, which the tugboat ends up defeating with such ease and rapidity, Benjamin doesn't even have time to do anything but crouch down for a minute and hide. The lack of a life jacket doesn't even come into play at all. A set-up with no pay-off. What was the point of that? The episodic nature of the story makes it difficult to remember whether Tilda Swinton's character showed up before or after Benjamin went to war, but it doesn't even matter. Swinton has an affair with Button, but Swinton's husband is a spy! Oh shlt? Nope. That is another set-up without a pay-off. More conflict avoided. It's an affair without any repercussions.The closest the film comes to a plot is the love story between Daisy and Benjamin, which is also the closest the film comes to displaying any sort of real conflict. Benjamin goes to New York to surprise Daisy only to find out she is with someone else. She rejects him. Benjamin goes to Paris. Daisy rejects him again. However, the rejections are only temporary, and Daisy forgives him entirely. More conflict avoided.From there on, they live a wonderful life. There is even a montage showing how wonderful their life together is. Neither one has to deal with any sort of conflict for a while. They just have sex and fun all day long. They eventually end up having a child together, and Benjamin decides to walk out on them to avoid the possibility of conflict arising from the fact that he will eventually grow young and Daisy will have to care for both of them.So despite his radical disorder (that nobody even really comments on, let alone ridicules him over), Benjamin goes through what some would consider a perfect life. He ends up with everything he wants and doesn't even have to work to get it.Hell, I wish I was born backwards so my life would be free and easy.How could a story with a concept so ripe with conflict completely avoid it?",N/A

Just seeing him going through the aging process backward in the film is beyond brilliance. Cate Blanchett is very good too as the women Brad Pitts character loves in the film. All of the actors really give it their personnel best in this timeless classic. The film is fairly straight forward even though it is weird, Brad Pitts character was born old and through the years of his life he starts to grow younger and younger. It's just an epic journey through the life of what this man comes across. The film is on for about 3 hours but when I watched it that time went very quick. I do think longer films are so much better than short ones for the fact that they are more descriptive and you can get amazed by the story more.

879,Veer-Zaara,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2092295/,"Yash Chopra's Veer-Zaara is a film about humanity, devotion, sacrifice, and the power of love. It is a visually stunning and emotionally touching picture about star-crossed lovers who meet once and are tied forever. Yash Chopra artistically combines realism with greatly unrestrained emotion and some overdone sentimentality. Although the love story itself, the separation and everything else is very typical, Chopra creates an entirely different film in the way it portrays the respect the lovers have for each other, the honour they pay to parents and elders, and their genuine willingness to sacrifice themselves for each other. It is a cross-border love story between an Indian and a Pakistani, yet their nationality is not what prevents them from being together. That's what really makes sense in this film. It flows very well through the stunning views of Indian and Pakistani fields and groves, and colourfully shows the bright sides of each country. The film does look a bit dated, but then it does not have a defined period of historical time, which makes it an all-time saga.The film also addresses women's empowerment through Rani Mukherjee's role of a Pakistani lawyer who tries to overcome society. There are many surprising and touching moments in the film. The love story is portrayed grandiosely, with larger-than-life orchestral music of heavy violins and piano. The movie soundtrack is perhaps the most beautiful soundtrack in recent years, and the fact that it was actually composed many years ago contributes to the epic mood of the film. Shahrukh Khan and Preity Zinta are great choices for the film. They resuscitate their characters with restraint and dignity and have a credible chemistry despite not having much physical interaction. Khan is the main soul of the film and he is believable in everything his character goes through. Zinta is beautiful and compelling as the intelligent and headstrong Zaara, and looks great in traditional outfits. Rani Mukhejee makes a great impact with her relatively minor but pivotal role of the tenacious, level-headed Saammiya. She is natural and impressive and leaves the film as a winner.Veer-Zaara, though a completely entertaining epic romance, is not the greatest film you'll see and it often goes over-the-top in its emotions. It is far from being flawless and has its share of loopholes where script is concerned. Having said that, it just doesn't matter here. This film is far ahead of anything it can be blamed for. It is about the main values a person should cherish in life: humanity, respect and love, and it conveys this message very well. It is one of those films which become classics instantly, and I recommend it to anyone, whoever and wherever he is.",Veer-Zaara
880,Adam's Apples,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1339998/,"This was a wonderful surprise at the (Cleveland) CIFF, a well-made dark comedy.Adam is a neo-Nazi on a sort of Danish ""probation for reprobates"", where society's sinners are given a gradual re-introduction to public life under the guidance of Ivan, a parish minister. Adam needs to negotiate a ""program"" for his several weeks stay; despite his efforts at being arch and cynical Ivan takes him totally in seriousness, setting ""baking an apple pie"" as Adam's goal. A battle of wills ensues between Adam and Ivan, with wonderful comedic support from Gunnar (Nicolas Bro in another wonderful role) the ex-tennis player and Khalid (Ali Kazim) as a not-yet-reformed terrorist.Everyone is coping here, but the central character is clearly Ivan (perhaps the funniest I've seen Mads Mikkelsen!). He comes across as ""Pangloss"" with a twist: ""everything is for the best"" in this world only in that the devil conspires to make everything a test of man's faith. He is completely deluded yet completely steadfast. This rational irrationality is perhaps the greatest challenge to Adam; no matter what he does Ivan retains his faithto a point where the comedy simply takes another course.Not to give away the delight of this comedy's surprises, the characters cope with life, each other, are exasperated and exasperating, consistently inconsistentthe trials of Job are well played out in this barely disguised absurdist romp.",N/A

882,Pride & Prejudice,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1213354/,"This film is one of the worst adaptations of Pride and Prejudice ever filmed and if Jane Austen were alive, she would demand that her name be removed from the film. Austen's novel is only superficially a story of the development of true love between Elizabeth Bennet and Fitzwilliam Darcy. It is also a commentary on the class structure of Regency Britain. This film focuses only on the love story, thereby disappointing viewers who hoped it would do justice to the novel.There are numerous problems with the historical accuracy of the film. In the film, the dance at which Darcy snubs Elizabeth is not the refined dancing done by the gentry, to which the Bennet, Lucas, Bingley, and Darcy families belong, but is rather the dancing of the lower classes. The gentry would not have been dancing as if they were at a peasant barn dance. There are costume and hair problems, too. The custom of the period required married women to wear white cloth hats to cover their hair and for women to wear bonnets when outdoors. Women of the Regency period were not so liberated as to forego the bonnet requirements in public. The worst historical inaccuracy is the early morning meeting of Elizabeth (in her nightgown and coat) and Mr. Darcy (sans cravat and vest) at which they admit their love for each other. This is an unforgivable liberty with the novel. No respectable young woman or gentleman would venture out of doors in such a state of undress or seek to meet someone of the opposite sex at such an early hour. But the worst thing of all with this film is the mangling of Austen's dialogue and the atrocious modern dialogue. Austen's dialogue needs no assistance from a writer who thinks he/she can write like Austen. The writer of the non-Austen dialogue not only lacks Austen's talent but also has no feel for Austen's style. The juxtaposition of the two styles is jarring.As for the acting, the best is done by Judi Dench, who clearly understands the imperiousness of the aristocracy. Brenda Blethyn takes some liberties in making Mrs. Bennet less awful than Austen's portrayal. Her portrayal is interesting and seems to work. Donald Sutherland is miscast. His affected British accent is terrible and he portrays Mr. Bennet too much as a father of the 20th century and not a father of the late 18th century. Matthew MacFadeyn's portrayal of Darcy is flat. I can't imagine anyone falling in love with his Mr. Darcy. Keira Knightly is a pretty Elizabeth, but her portrayal of Elizabeth Bennet is far too modern. Knightly focuses on the Elizabeth's forthrightness, but her portrayal completely lacks an understanding of the social mores and conventions of the time. She would have done well to actually read the novel before attempting to portray Elizabeth and to do research on the behavior of women of the period.If one is making a period movie, one must be true to the period. This film needed an historical adviser who actually knows something about the Regency period. It also needed a writer who has a better appreciation and understanding of Austen's text. I can only hope Emma Thompson decides to do a film of Pride and Prejudice in the near future to erase this abomination from our minds.The best thing that can be said about this film is that it contains many pretty scenes of the English countryside. Chatsworth is well used as Pemberly (as it was in the 1995 BBC adaptation). But pretty scenery and pretty actors cannot save this film. True fans of Austen will rush home to watch their DVDs of the far superior 1995 BBC production with Jennifer Ehle and Colin Firth or to read Austen's text in order to wipe this version from their minds.",Pride and Prejudice (2005)
883,Pride & Prejudice,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1209838/,"before i start, i would like to say this. i can read, have read the book, and i read the title of the movie before watching, as should you all. quite disappointed in all the pompous idiots filled with prejudice about the movie.I know that another version of the well-mined Jane Austen classic would need to be brilliant indeed. Such diverse and beautifully written characters and such a delightful plot, so deeply rooted in a profound understanding of human nature, are timelessly attractive to directors, actors and audiences alike. So give them a break. you couldn't do any better.Lets start with Mr Darcy. Darcys embodied by Olivier, Firth and now Matthew McFadyen bring differently significance to enjoy in the proud and socially awkward leading male role. Where Olivier and Firth gave us an aloof, arrogant Darcy encased rigidly in a shell so impenetrable it was almost impossible to believe he had been moved by Lizzie's sardonic criticisms or attracted by her spirited independence, McFadyen shows a more accessible Darcy. He's vulnerable, even fragile behind his stiff manners. His aloofness is more believably from social inadequacy than arrogance, yet he is believably constrained by his social standing to regard decorum, fortune and propriety in a wife's family as significant in his choice of a bride. His capitulation to Lizzie is therefore more believable.Similarly Garson, Ehle and Keira Knightley illustrate the lively intelligence, sharp-minded wit and wry humour of Elizabeth Bennet in equally shining ways that nevertheless bring out different aspects of the character. Keira Knightly's performance as Elizabeth Bennett is by far her best, as she sparkles in this role.The two have a chemistry that i had yet to see on the big or small screen - one that mirrors real life romances. the dislike on both accounts is obvious, watching it grow to love was beautiful and stunning. the love story is heart-felt and sweetly, deeply affecting to a level that modern romantic comedies rarely achieve. I found this movie to be a a richly photographed, memorable ensemble production in which the romance is predominant over the drama but does not eclipse it. though my one disappointment - the ending?! of course i wanted to see them kiss, who didn't? but the shots of them arguing in the rain, and as they draw close with the sunlight shining between them was breathtaking.Giving due significance to the rural environment which plays such an important part in the story, the cinematography captures wide frames of soft, misty fields, copses and winding country roads as an environment which underscores the gentle manners and passionately beating hearts beneath empire gowns and ruffled shirts. The surroundings both detract from the humans and function as appropriately natural settings for the dramas of human nature.Keira Knightley's swan-like Elizabeth moves with energy and grace, hotly opinionated and profoundly moved by principles and prejudices, and magnetically drawn by the seeming arrogance, reticence and gallant behaviour, finally revealed, of Mr Darcy. For two centuries Elizabeth Bennet has been a heroine much admired for her self-contained independence within a culture more conditioned to female submissiveness. Knightley's portrayal is true to the original.All in all, i must give this movie 5 stars, 10 out of 10, 100 % brilliance. The story itself, the characters, the actors, everything that was in the movie 'bewitched me body and soul'. i have never been more moved by a movie, especially not one where i found it to be as hilarious as it was moving.",Pride & Prejudice
884,The World's Fastest Indian,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1284927/,"We very much enjoyed this film, even though we had to watch it on a small screen in a relatively obscure theater. The true story of a New Zealand hero is a classic and deserved a great film. Here we have it. With minimal pretension and just the right combination of drama and laugh-out loud comedic relief, this film entertains on every level. One can't help but fall in love with the legend that is Burt Munro, and be inspired by his legacy of tenacity and endurance. Although the story is of a New Zealander in the 1960s, the journey Munro takes is universal. His determination to live his dream is a theme everyone can understand. I thoroughly recommend this film to all ages and walks of life - there's something in this film for everyone.",The World's Fastest Indian

It's not a ""guy's film"" at all but a serious look at the life of a man that was average by his own reckoning - by ours he's a hero. When you find yourself looking at that and saying ""I would have quit"" and it was only the beginning of the movie, well, that's some tough stock Burt Munro came from.And it's not tedious, not an uphill struggle all the way against insurmountable odds, none of those clichés. It's a great movie about a real guy and I can't imagine someone watching it and not being entertained, moved, and frankly, impressed.",N/A
886,Tokyo Godfathers,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2188658/,"Tokyo Godfathers, a 2003 Japanese anime from well known director Satoshi Kon (Paprika, Millennium Actress), is about an unlikely trio of homeless people that finds a baby abandoned on Christmas eve. Although the obvious inspiration for this story is John Ford's similarly titled 1948 Western Three Godfathers, the coincidence filled novels of Charles Dickens are an even greater influence. Like Dickens, Kon is interested in the lives of the poverty stricken. Also, Kon's film is just as full of incredulity straining coincidences and plot twists as well known Dickens novels such as Great Expectations. There are also some similarities to Dickens' Christmas Carol including numerous flashbacks and a character encountering what seems to be a future version of himself who offers him a second chance.Satoshi Kon's film is more than just a pastiche of his influences, however, he brings his own unique sensibilities to the table. For one thing, neither Dickens nor Ford would have dreamed of focusing a story on a transvestite who desperately wants to be a mother. The animation is always well done and it manages to draw just as much focus as the frenetically outlandish plot twists and turns. These narrative elements include chance encounters with figures from each of the three godfathers' pasts, an encounter with a yakuza boss and his would be assassin who only speaks Spanish, and a visit to a gender bending night club.Tokyo Godfathers does an excellent job of presenting its characters realistically and it even manages to be fair about some of their less savory actions. The film also comes close to working on an emotional level: there are some genuinely heart-warming moments but they are presented so quickly that their impact is lessened. Ultimately, this film has a few too many unlikely plot contrivances that go by a little too fast for it to be a great one but it works well enough often enough to make the film better than average.",Tokyo Godfathers
887,Tokyo Godfathers,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0934962/,"At first glance, I wasn't sure if I would like this movie. The ""miracles DO happen on Christmas"" cliché is very boring and I typically don't enjoy movies that employ it, but this is a very different kind of Christmas movie.We are given three homeless characters with complex personalities and backgrounds, who are as endearing as they are repellent. They take up the task of caring for a baby they found in the trash, and trying to bring it back to its mother. We learn the secrets that made these people homeless, we learn about the workings of human shame and desperation, and we learn that ""miracles DO happen on Christmas."" But in the least cheesy way possible!The plot is very slow-moving, but still, it is interesting and very carefully laid out. This would be a very compelling live-action movie, but the use of animation adds so much visual interest, particularly the expressive (and sometimes hideous!!) face of Hana, the gangly transvestite. The choice of music is unique and very fitting: the song played during a walking-around-the-city montage is reminiscent of Clockwork Orange.Interesting and careful story, complex and realistic story, tremendous visual appeal and excellent music. I guess this movie pretty much has it all!",N/A
888,Serenity,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1630251/,"After reading on the BBC that this was voted the best sci-fi movie of all time, I thought fair enough, I'll check it out. I am extremely disappointed. Lousy incomprehensible story line, lousy cheesy script, lousy acting, lousy effects..the lousy list just goes on and on! Most of the scenes from the movies have been stolen from other films, star wars, resident evil, blade runner, aliens etc..but unfortunately, that's just simply not enough to make a good movie. I can't believe people rated this garbage over 2001, alien, blade runner & star wars according to the BBC article. I also can't believe this has such a high rating on this site. IMDb used to be fairly reliable as a review source for movies, I can only guess that every 12 year old with a computer has now taken residence on this site and has destroyed any credibility it once had.",N/A
889,Serenity,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1152837/,"The others do a good job gushing about the movie. Sure we're fans and bound to like the movie more than the usual fare, but those looking for an original and thrilling movie experience, this will shock and amaze. The Firefly world introduced a fantasy home for many of us, with characters we truly cared about and dilemmas we could get behind. The best way to describe it is to take the best aspects of the Han Solo elements of the original Star Wars, and build a world around that. There's no grand theme or clear cut good and evil. There's just a band of fugitives trying to make their way in a dangerous sky. It's something folks can relate to, although most of us won't be in a space battle or fighting psychotic creatures anytime soon. The point of the name Serenity is the name of the ship, though in a deeper sense that's what our characters are in search of. Finding freedom and a home, and that's what the ship represents to them, and to the fans. So you understand why so many are so excited about this dinky little scifi flick. The movie captures that beautiful feeling but takes us on a ride that there's no turning back from. In my opinion, the one thing that makes for a truly GREAT movie is if you walk out of the theater a different person than when you walked in. This movie takes you on such a journey I didn't know if I would leave the theater at all. Sure the visual effects are stunning, but even the unfinished effects I saw meant nothing to me because it was the characters I cared about (and note that the digitally created ship itself is one of them, and I cared just as much for that than any of them). The humor is probably better than anything in the theaters this year, and the action is even greater. My screening actually came a week after Episode 3 was released, and I immediately washed my hands of Mr Lucas, and months later when I saw Fantastic 4... well let's not even talk about that one.This movie really does have something for everyone, and even in the core of the geek fandom, the range of people is total - men and women split it at least 50/50, uber-geeks and ""cool"" types, and a surprising amount of attractive people of all ages. Seriously though, don't trust the rants of the fans. Check out the movie for yourself. Give it an honest chance and I promise you will be taken on a journey that will turn you into a fan as well.",Serenity
890,Walk the Line,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1227066/,"At one level, this is the same old thing: success, booze, redemption, comeback. Nothing new at all here and the history changed to fit the formula. At another level  the one most moviegoers will see  is a concert with background intended to make the concert richer. If you had ever seen John and June perform, you will know that this movie version is a whole lot better. And you may also admit that the reason you went to see them wasn't because of their music, but because of the whole story of them and what they symbolized -- and how that colored the music.In other words, their lives were deliberately part of the show. They made it so, even punching up John's ex-con status and other tough guy attributes. The whole Carter family developed this as a marketing strategy long before John appeared, though their lives were artificially made in the mold of wholesome, white Baptists.So, if you follow these things, what we have here is a nice construction: Two stage performers who make their lives part of their performance, portrayed in another performance (the movie) that features the reverse: lives illustrated through stage performances. Managing all those layers as they have makes this mildly interesting.And the surprise of Reese is something too, though it makes sense if you know the type that southern women played as roles in those days.What's missing is all the interesting stuff. John's obsession with the devil, the theories of his brother being murdered or committing suicide, the long-term weaving of paths with Bob Dylan  holy and otherwise. The debauchery. The deliberate manipulation of religion in the 70s as part of the public relations of his comeback. His phenomenal loss of weight. The rivalry among his touring mates. Deep, deep, rivalry.Now wouldn't all that real stuff have made a better movie than the formula script we have here?As with all big movies these days, you have the movie proper and you have the beginning sequence. Studios (meaning financiers) take these very seriously and bring in a separate creative team, usually uncredited. This opening is far, far better than the movie itself. It has a whole different feel, obviously a different director and cinematographer. Obviously edited by a different crew.Ted's Evaluation -- 2 of 3: Has some interesting elements.",N/A

I was not sure what to expect when I heard they were going to do their own singing, but was I ever impressed. Their performances in this movie were brilliant, and I had chills down my spine. It was truly amazing how much Phoenix sounded like Johnny Cash-this was a role he was born to play, and he was mesmerizing. Totally sizzling. Witherspoon was positively radiant as June Carter, and talk about chemistry between the two actors. Talk about lightning striking! I only hope they are rewarded for their efforts come Oscar time. This was a truly amazing movie, filled with great music, a top-notch supporting cast and a terrific script which was wonderfully directed.",Walk the Line
892,Evil,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1501585/,"This was a big surprise to me because the DVD cover said ""Fight club in a school"", and I associated it with the well-known Fight club with Brad Pitt (that was excellent too,but very different).From the one side I hate movies that are so good they make me want to hit the sadistic step-father, to shake the complacent, frightened mother and make her defend her son by getting rid of that horrid husband-it's frustrating to want to do these things from your sofa! From the other side, I would not trade a movie like this for ""war of the Worlds"" for anything! It involves the viewer-the unfairness of it, the cruelty of it, and above all, the truth of it is devastating.All the actors were wonderful, and Andreas Wilson was absolutely superb-something in his manner reminded me very much of James Dean and Alain Delon. I hope we'll see many more movies from the talented team that made ""Evil"".For those reviewers who were a little upset thinking we would not see this movie in America-be happy for us-it's here!!",Evil
893,Evil,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1023287/,"In Sweden, Erik Ponti (Andreas Wilson) is the son of a remiss mother, and his stepfather gives sadistic beatings on him, using the most futile pretexts, without any interference of his mother. His dysfunctional family makes him a very violent teenager, culminating with his expulsion from the public school system in Sweden, due to a fight and aggression against another pupil. His mother sells some belongings of her and sends him to the elitist private school of Stjärnberg, as his last chance to complete his basic education. However, behind the name of the expensive and conservative school, there is a code of (dis)honor among the students, where the younger and those who belong to the lower social classes are humiliated by the veterans and those who belong to the high social classes without any questioning of the director. Erik feels like in hell while studying in Stjärnberg. ""Evil"" is a stunning movie, which shows the danger of the power in wrong hands. Indeed, it is a psychological study of violence, which leads to cruelty. It explains the social behavior of, for example, street children in Brazil, who are sent very young to state reformatories and become cruel criminals when adults. The story is very engaging and the performance of the cast is outstanding, highlighting Andreas Wilson and his greatest opponent, the sadistic Otto Silverhielm (Gustaf Skarsgard). This movie shakes the viewers and in the end, we are cheering to Erik's revenge, wishing him to kill his aggressors, in a total inversion of the moral values. The DVD released by the Brazilian distributor VF Vídeo Filmes shows also a total lack of respect with the Brazilian consumers: in the Extras, there is an interview in Swedish with the director Mikael Häfström and the making-of, both without sub-titles, as if Brazilian people could understand this language. My vote is nine.Title (Brazil): ""Evil  Raízes do Mal"" (""Evil  Roots of Evil"")",Evil
894,The Motorcycle Diaries,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0873398/,"The Motorcycle Diaries does a great job of sketching out the character of Ernesto Guevara de la Serna, without any pandering to our knowledge of who he will become. There are no cheap shots and only one 'Che' joke-to explain the origin of the nickname, which is a play on the Argentinian accent. It's a deeply felt examination of the events that inspired the development of a political consciousness, with only a few touches of the hagiography that has developed around 'el Che' and those not until late in the film. Gael Garcia Bernal is completely believable and very human in the role, and there's real chemistry between him and Rodrigo de la Serna (any relation?) who plays his friend Granado, leading to a lot of funny moments-important, as ther are many stretches of the movie where it is just them and the scenery. The cinematography is truly gorgeous, and reminded me how little of the South American landscape we ever see on film in the U.S. The cinematographer has pulled off a major feat in shooting a period film in slightly grainy, sometimes shaky hand-held. No crane shots or sepia tinting here-the film quality immerses you in Guevara and Granado's experiences and makes them feel very immediate, without sacrificing any sense of history. A film like this is long overdue, and it deserves wide distribution. While the plot revolves around Che's awakening to the social struggles of South America (which are ongoing) there is a rich sense of place, and people, and beauty here. It seems to me that this is the first South American film in a few years that is not a world-weary documentary about social or political problems (and U.S. involvement in them), to open in the U.S. market. It's about the life of Che, yes, but it doesn't forget the people and problems that lead him into political activity, and will hopefully inspire viewers to pay more attention to what is going on around them, not only in Buenos Aires, Cuzco, Havana or Chiapas, but right next door.",The Motorcycle Diaries
895,Lilya 4-Ever,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0843539/,"Director Lukas Moodysson has achieved a film that is so moving that it is hard to forget it after leaving the theater. Images come back into one's mind about this story about this girl. The tragedy of her life is something to be shocked and alarmed.To think there are out there, in the so-called civilized world, people that take advantage of girls like Lilja is mind boggling. Lilja's mother has to be one of the worst monsters ever presented in a film. This woman abandons her 16 year old daughter because she has found a meal ticket with a man that will probably end up leaving her as well.Lilja is beautifully portrayed by Oksana Akinshina. The actress and her character disappear in front of your eyes. The story is very true as thousands of naive girls are exported from what it was the old Soviet Union to other countries in order to force them into prostitution. This story is constantly in the news, yet more and more young girls are duped into going abroad with the promise of highly paid jobs that exist only for the people who exploit them.Her only friend is Volodya, also a very sad boy who is thrown out of his own house by an abusive father. Volodya and Lilja form a bond as they cling to one another. The little boy is street wise; he knows the fate that awaits Lilja in Sweden. Their friendship is the only thing they both have.The sad part of the film is the realization that so called ""normal"" and perfectly ""respectful"" people are the same ones that brutalize these children. They use Lilja to satisfy their sexual appetites, then discard her like yesterday's trash. To know that there are people like that in our society is a very sad commentary about our world.Contrary to what many people have commented about the film, I thought that in spite of the tragedy of Lilja's and Volodya's lives, it had a very positive ending because both are free to run around in a better place together, which is not a luxury most of us have on our time in this planet.Mr. Moodysson gives us a film that will shock; he dares to go where others wouldn't. A job well done..",Lilja 4-ever
896,Lilya 4-Ever,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0843522/,"It is not often that everyone is quiet after a movie at the cinema. Some were crying, others did not know how to act, ending up staring out in to the emptiness. For me, nothing was the same after I did leave the cinema. I know that it sounds like a cliché, but I tell you, it is not. Some of these people were laughing before they sat down, but the haunting beginning of the movie did wake everyone up. Every day you do wake up, when you are working you do hurry away; maybe you take your children with you to leave them at the nearby kindergarten. If it is a holiday, maybe you are of to meet some friends. In the evening you come home, you are cooking and eating. Maybe you do sit down with your wife and kids watching a good TV-show. When the night comes, you are wishing your child's a good night's sleep before you go to bed. It is not easy for you to know what is going on inside the apartment of your neighbour. The time that pass from the beginning to the end is the time the director Lukas Moodysson have to convince you that the reality is not as good as you may think, or maybe you already know, all to well.
The reality of leading character Lilja becomes slowly a part of your reality. You can choose to see Lilja in two different points of view. You can see her as a part of a fairly tale, and nothing more, than her life story will disappear after the movie in your shower. Or you may see her as she is; a picture of what life can do with people who are not as lucky as you, a picture of other girls in the same situation as she. The great acting of the 15 year old Russian actress Oksana Akinsjina makes it possible. I did almost forget that she is not Lilja when I did see the movie, it is heartbreaking when she is crying, and when she is happy her smile is the most wonderful you have seen that day. But a few minutes later you may see pain in her eyes.  If you are thinking about what is happing in the movie, you will understand her reactions. When it is painful then she cries without hope, when it is too painful she doesn't seems to react at all (exactly like you!) and you don't need to imagine to feel the pain she have inside.
The one that will become more close to her than anyone else is the street kid and male leading character Volodja act by the 12 year old Artiom Bogutjarskij (his first movie). I have worked with street children and his acting is very authentic. When everything falls apart for Lilja, Volodja becomes her last hope, he is never leaving her in her mind he is always close. He is the one who is always there, the one that catches her when she falls. Lukas said in an interview that Volodja are a shape of Jesus in the end you will understand. These parts are telling about the dreams of Lilja, whom makes it easier to understand her vision of hope. Lukas is the best Swedish director now and maybe of all time. The integrity of his actors is intact, that he manages to do it in a movie like this shows how good as a director he is. He has a moving respect for Oksana and the way he cares about her integrity is the thing that makes this movie worth looking. His manuscript is trustworthy and don't have any illogical lacks. Nothing is darker than it could be in the reality. All characters are three dimensional and even the evil characters are human, even the victims are not just victims.You may wonder if the reality is this dark. In a article in a Swedish newspaper Lukas Moodyson told that he had spoken with a social worker and he was told that some mothers do sell their own kids for 1 £ to the sex industry. Though the movie is fictional and not about her, many of the memorable things that are happening to Lilja in the movie did happen to Dangoule Rasalaite from Latvia between the 17th September 1999 and the 10th January 2000. Lukas read about her in an article. The reality is always worse than the fiction.The young actors do carry the weight of the movie with grace. Their acting against each other is moving, it is a special chemistry between them. Lukas has the gift of finding the right persons for the characters in all is movies, and Lilja 4-ever is not an exception. Last Monday Lilja forever won 5 out of 6 gold beagles (the most important Swedish film award) it was nominated to (Artiom was also nominated for best performance by an actor). The awards it won were for best movie, best picture, best manuscript, best direction, and the most important of them all, best performance by an actress. Trafficking is the third biggest illegal industry in the world; it makes this movie so important. Lukas Moodysson and Oksana did manage to wake up this nation, to show that our reality is not as good as we thought. We can see it in the reactions of the cinema public, how people are talking about it afterwards, and in the newspapers. The Swedish government are working for the possibility to show this movie in schools all over the former Sovjet Union. Lukas has said that if this movie can convince one girl to make other decisions than Lilja and to many other young girls; this movie was worth making.This movie is worth more than all the awards it has won and all the awards it will win. This movie can change your point of view, it is that message of hope it brings.

897,The Triplets of Belleville,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0815470/,"While a lot of the comments here seem to see this as the antithesis of American Disney- or Pixar-style animation, its blood lines are not as far removed from those examples as you might think.  Chomet explains in short documentary features on the DVD that the film was meant to look hand drawn, and though the character designs originated as loosely-rendered blue pencil sketches on Chomet's drawing pad, much if not all of what you see in the film itself is indeed computer animation.  The look of the film, according to Chomet, is actually heavily influenced by Disney's ""new"" animation style of the 1960s that was unveiled in the film ""101 Dalmatians.""At the same time, it can't be denied that this film is distinctly European in style, and likely to bore people who expect an animated film to be bright, colorful, loud, and not particularly subtle or complex.  Its wealth of detail is staggering, and can't be taken in through one cursory viewing. The little quirks of characterization and character design are numerous, but all the easier to discern because it's cinema in the classical sense of being primarily a visual medium, and there's not a lot of yammering for the sake of plot exposition or as a shortcut to characterization.  Those are meant to be gained through observation, and what a feast for the eyes it is. This is another example of a film at which simple people with simple tastes lob the tired old warhorse criticism ""pretentious.""  There's nothing wrong or shameful in having simple tastes, bit I wish they wouldn't feel thus obligated to publicly pee all over any work of art more subtle than a Roger Rabbit cartoon.I think special mention should be made of the soundtrack, which is a rich brew of sound layered on sound, but with a decidedly delicate touch.  Note the sound effects in the climactic car chase through the streets of Belleville.  Most filmmakers would be temped to goose up the excitement and chaos of the scene with loud, piercing sounds of crashing, screeching tires, gunshots, etc.  While these noises are present, they are in fact applied very lightly and delicately, sounding almost like the collision of toy cars and the shooting of toy guns, which lends the scene a surreal, otherworldly quality that the more conventional choice of loud, overbearing sound effects wouldn't yield.  It's been remarked here that the combination of minimalist dialog, strange characters, and baroquely complex settings are reminiscent of Jeunet, and I think that's the most apt comparison, particularly his earlier style as in ""Delicatessen.""The first scene is of particular interest in that it is in a different style from the rest of the film, designed to look like old black and white animation from the 1930s.  One of the conventions of animated shorts in that era was to include bizarre caricatures of celebrities.  Now I recognized Django Reinhardt, Josephine Baker, and Fred Astair, but who was the orchestra conductor supposed to be?  He has very distinctive features which lead me to believe he represents some specific real person, but nobody comes to mind.  Maybe he's someone better known to a French audience?  I'd be very interested to know.Some people seem to think there is a strong anti-American bias to this film. Does it poke fun at North-Americans?  Sure it does, but it also makes fun of the French (note the huge noses, receding chins, and tiny little mustaches, along with the Triplets' penchant for regarding whatever slimy thing they can yank out of the swamp as a succulent delicacy).  Admittedly this French caricaturing is not quite as barbed as the swipes at American culture.  But come on, we're big boys.  We can take it!  Just gnaw on a few freedom fries and suck it up already.  Actually, this film sort of sums up the history of France's attitudes toward American culture over the last 70 years.  They adored us in the 1930s, but the honeymoon has been over for a while.One more detail.  To an earlier commentator who found it hilarious that in the song ""Belleville Rendezvous"" the Triplets sing the phrase ""ca-ca,"" they are in fact singing ""can can"" (""voodoo, can-can"").  The characteristic French pronunciation ""cahn-cahn"" just makes it sound a lot like ""ca-ca.""",The Triplets of Belleville
898,The Triplets of Belleville,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0815449/,"From the moment I pressed play on the DVD remote, the whole family was transfixed by this wonderful movie. It was so good, that we immediately watched it again. So what was so good about it? Well, firstly Bruno has to be the best dog (either animated or live) in any movie. The subtle observation of its daily routines are among my favourite scenes. Second, the humour is refreshingly dark and constantly surprising (it's not too far removed from Gary Larson's The Far Side). The scene showing the expansion of Paris to convey the passing of time had us in hysterics. Thirdly, it's just so imaginative. Everything is exaggerated beyond belief. If you like your animation to have a touch of realism, then stay away. In Belleville, things are grotesquely exaggerated. I've noticed a few negative comments about this film, which raises the question of who is going to like it and who isn't. I guess the fairest comment I can make is to say that this probably isn't mainstream stuff. If your favourite movies are summer blockbusters, then maybe this isn't for you. If, on the other hand, you like discovering quiet gems from time to time, stumbling across something a little different on a cable channel, then this could be just what you're looking for.",N/A
899,Joint Security Area,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4476258/,"When ""Joint Security Area"" began, with non-descript military figures of various origins walking around and discussing dull events in different languages and accents, I was prepared for a tedious military/political thriller like ""A Few Good Men"".I should have trusted Park Chanwook.This is, after all, about the demilitarized zone in between the two Koreas, perhaps the only place on Earth where soldiers of either side come into relatively friendly contact with one another.This has to be one of the most fascinating contemporary topics, and the movie really comes alive when flashbacks of the soldiers interacting play out. This is, thankfully, the majority of the run-time.If the movie has a failing, it's the framing story - showing a young woman investigating the mysterious shooting that resulted from the unusual north-meets-south dynamic - this part doesn't work so well on its own. I think Park wasn't able to find a vein to really connect these scenes with the reader. Perhaps they could have been stripped back, left out, or approached some other way.",Joint Security Area
900,The Count of Monte Cristo,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2217694/,"Alexander Dumas wrote this inspiring story in 1844 and has since become a mainstay of classical literature, stage plays and films. The story as he penned it, tells the tale of a young and naive sailor named Edmond Dantes (James Caviezel) living during the Nepolonic era. His fortunes are set. He is to be the new ship's Captain, marry his betrothed Mercedes (Dagmara Dominczyk) and live a good and long life. However greedy, envious and jealous men Lt. Fernand Mondego, (Guy Pearce) James Frain as Prosecuter Villefort and Danglars (Albie Woodington) betray him and further conspire to have him arrested and imprisoned. Suffering years of lonely despair in the Château D'if, he is befriended by another prisoner an Italian priest named Abbe Faria (Richard Harris). The kindly old man educates Edmond in return for companionship. Upon the old man's death, Edmond is bequeathed a fabulous treasure map. With his good friend Jacopo (played adroitly by Luis Guzmán) he prepares to return from the grave and exact revenge. This movie is definitely more exciting than most and despite it's having dark dramatic scenes which promises more than is delivered, the result becomes an excellent companion to the original Dumas novel. ****",N/A
901,The Count of Monte Cristo,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0729676/,"I hired this one on a whim, remembering that i had seen the trailer and had been vaguely intrigued.  I have to admit, having gone in with little expectation, i was flawed!  This was one of the better movies that i have seen in a long time.  Jim Caviezel's performance is slightly whiny to begin with, but in the context of the whole story, the reason therefore is appreciated and makes his transition and growth as a character that much more riveting to watch.  I absolutely loved him as Edmund Dantes then the dynamic Count of Monte Cristo and cannot have imagined a better choice.  He was definitely not bad on the eyes either.  Every scene had him looking more dashing and more handsome than the one before.Guy Pierce surprised me with a performance that was totally believable.  His dry humour only made him more appealing, very well acted.The entire epic, though long, never gives you the impression that you have been sitting still for ages.  It moves along swiftly and always had me gripped, from the action, suspense, and even to the humour that was evident from time to time.  The love story surprised me most of all.  Instead of taking on a highly sexual slant, as all these new films do, it was understated, the female lead doing an admirable job of portraying the wounded lover, who has always longed for her Edmund.  I loved the innocence that she managed to bring to the role, a really terrific actress and a really beautiful one as well.Wonderfully scripted, exceptionally carried out!  This has to be the best adaptation yet!An emphatic 10!",The Count of Monte Cristo
902,Waking Life,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0976910/,"Waking Life is probably one of the most randomly amazing works that I have seen. It's lack of a plot, random events, and constant motion give it the dreamlike feel. The ideas are all so intriguing that I don't understand how anyone can hate this movie. I can understand that it could be hard to sit through if you're tired, or if you refuse to contemplate the endless possibilities presented. I'll also admit that some people would find it very hard to watch the animation, but to me it keeps your attention. I tried to imagine what this movie would have been like if it hadn't been animated and I don't think it would have had the impact on as many people as it has if it weren't for the animation. I think that anyone who enjoys the topic of dreams would find it worthwhile. I could watch this movie over and over and still find something that I hadn't noticed before. If you don't like movies that make you think, don't watch it. But if you want a movie that gives you a lot of things to think about and allows you the freedom to interpret it in many different ways . . . check it out!",Waking Life
903,Waking Life,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0722310/,"This is one of the most thought provoking films I've ever seen. It's also visually stunning and perfectly acted: every single one of these people seem to be just giving their own opinions as if you were overhearing/having a meaningful conversation with them. We can chalk this up to the genius of Linklater who over the years has shown not only the pretentiously humorous coffee house crowd cliches but also the searching, often deeply insightful side of our generation that the media overlooked when we were dubbed slackers. In films he has written: ""Slacker"" and ""Before Sunrise"" and in his films of stage plays Bogosian's brilliant, Chekhovian ""SubUrbia"" and the faintly melodramatic ""Tape"", Linklater has always been fascinated with the question of what we should doing with our lives. Our responsibility is to contribute something lasting and meaningful to our society. But what exactly is that? Where and when should I do it? Who with? How do I know if I've really found it? Why is it so important again, anyway? I saw this movie for the first time late last night and 5 minutes before it started I had fallen asleep and was hoping I'd be able to make it all the way through the film. From the first frame I was riveted and completely awake and remained so even after it was over; contemplating all the myriad viewpoints the film had thrown at me.This movie is so exciting and bursting with ideas that I'm going to buy the DVD as soon as I possibly can and watch it over and over trying to absorb it all.See this film. It will remind you of how thrilling it is to be an active thinking, feeling member of the human race.",N/A
904,Remember the Titans,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1089511/,"This movie received a lot of criticism for being a little too ""light"" in it's depiction of racism in that time period. However, the fact that Disney decided to take on the topic at all astounds me. I think that this movie is incredibly effective and an excellent football movie. It really sucks you into these characters and make you feel for them. I am emotionally affected by this film no matter how many times I've seen it, and I think that this movie will stand up over time as one of the most endearing sports classics of all time.Quote that i believe defines the movie: ""I don't care if you like each other, but you will respect each other.

Of course, it's the 70's and racism is still rampant. I love the message that people will mesh anyway despite outside complications. Julius' and Gerry's relationship was really profound and special. It crossed a lot of lines. Denzel was remarkable as Coach Boone. He took no crap, yet was scared to lose his position underneath. There was tension everywhere and it worked for the film. The players were really memorable to me. Blue, Rev, Sunshine, Petey, and Louie Lastik were adorable and hilarious. A great ensemble cast effort. The guy who played Yoast was good as well, because he had to learn to overcome prejudices he had that he never knew he did. Even better, was the fact that it's a true story which makes it all the more sweet. I watch this movie over and over and can practically say every line by heart. Great, great film.

906,"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon",https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0636728/,"Spoilers herein.Ang Lee is one of two best mainstream directors working today who has deliberately worked in different styles, genres, artistic philosophies even. (The other is Ridley Scott.) Here he tries to inject art and majesty in a common vehicle. To remain true to the vehicle, he must use a thin story (though with numerous threads) and an understated acting style. I think this understated focus on faces helps make the subtitles more palatable than they would be otherwise. They are also larger and higher than normal, so one's eye doesn't have to jump so much from face to word. There's no question that this film was conceived with the western reading eye in mind.Lee pumps up the skeleton well enough with grand vistas and wonderful sets. The vision is surreal, which befits the mythical drama. In this and several other ways, he greatly surpasses the `Star Wars' feel. I must say that the final cave/warehouse was too theatrical -- it just didn't fit the rest. Some of the mattes are annoyingly fakey. The bambootop fight was ungraceful. But those are relative nits.What I wanted in this film was a whole new level in choreographing the CAMERA during fight scenes. I know this is a hot topic among directors just now, and think he is quite up to the challenge. He has already shown mastery of the inside, emotional camera, and the notion of bringing this to dance excited me. He teases with some spectacular camera movement, but it is always in a conventional frame. Guess he wanted to sell a lot of tickets instead of reinvent the medium.What I mean: with the fights, you have several characters, the two (or howevermany) fighters, the swords, the viewer and the camera. In a good film, some of these will merge. In a masterful production that merger will shift so that the camera is the sword, the viewer, then the fighter. (Here, the green sword IS a central fighter.) But add to that the complication of the idiom: each fighter and weapon is actually just a token for the master. Each fight is a battle between invisible characters, whose perspective the camera can also take.Lee plays these fights too safe, and it really annoys because he shows us ever so fleetingly what he can do. Sometimes, the camera is the sword, sometimes the master, but in teasing glimpses only. He's concerned with making sense, and that requires sticking to convention. Maybe as he gets older, he'll do this again, but with more multidimensional vision, more enlightenment, less concern for the general viewer.But check out the fight scores. This drummer knows the dimensions we're talking about, because he follows Lee's camera when it leaves the body. Cool.This film also has the sexiest literary scene I've ever experienced. (And that counts the lush ""Pillow Book."") It will be worth owning for that 15 seconds alone. Watch Jen's calligraphy, obviously done by a master. You won't ever forget it now that I've pointed it out. Watch the subtle camera movement. The whole of `Quills' in a few seconds! That reading eye again.",Unknown.

907,"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon",https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0636572/,"As Ang Lee, I grew up reading wuxia novels in Taiwan. Those novels usually mixed engrossing history, thrilling action, enchanting romance. But when these novels were made into movies or TV series, none of them could match my imagination. It's either because of wrong casting, bad acting, tedious costumes, sloppy storytelling, minimal budget (so everything is shot in studio rather than in the grand Chinese landscapes as they were told in books), fake action... I could go on and on. Now Ang Lee finally made a wuxia film that captures my imagination and fulfills my dream of childhood.
The casting of CTHD is perfect. No disrespect to Jet Li, but Jet Li would not make Li Mu Bai into what he should be: noble, wise but weary. Chow Yun Fat conveys the unspoken feelings of Li Mu Bai in a way I can't imagine anyone else can. But he's known for his acting, Michelle Yeoh was known for her fighting skills. Here in CTHD, she proves herself as an excellent dramatic actress. The secrete longing for Li and the confusion of Li's true feelings were clearly conveyed by her eyes. The scenes between them are heartbreaking. Zhang Zi Yi is a true discovery! What a wonderful talent to steal scenes after scenes from the veterans around her. She ran from looking innocent, haughty, feisty to loving and distraught. She made the complex Jen a real flesh and blood believable human being. Chang Chen made a perfectly sexy and charming bandit.The scenery and the photography was beyond belief. The majestic landscapes of China match my imagination when I read all the beautiful Chinese poems of the Tang and Sung dynasties. No wonder those poets could come up with those masterpieces. They sure had the best inspiration. Peter Pau not only captured the landscapes and the settings, he also managed to capture the fast-as-lightening action wonderfully. The shot of Jen gliding over water just lodged in my mind. The soundtrack is also excellent. Tan Dun used different instruments to match the different locales. He mixed in Central Asian music in the desert sequence and Chinese flute in the Southern China scenes. Yo-yo Ma's cello in the main theme makes me want to weep everytime I hear it.The storytelling was also done expertly. As a romantic-at-heart, I love the desert romance between Jen and Lo. It's one of the most charming and believable love stories that I can remember. Most people gave credit of the fighting to Yuen Wo Ping. I'd give kudos to Ang Lee. I've seen Yuen's martial art films before, but they're never done in such an imaginative and artistic way. The artistic vision has to come from Ang Lee.To sum it up, three cheers for Ang Lee! You not only fulfilled your childhood dream, you fulfilled mine too. It's such a pleasure to finally see a wuxia novel be done right. Thank you! Thank you! Thank you!","Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"
908,All About My Mother,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5760897/,It's narrative is a little too similar to Almodóvar's other films but All About My Mother is still an incredibly moving drama that's funny and emotional. Cecilia Roth gives an incredible lead performance with great supporting performances from Penélope Cruz and Antonia San Juan. Pedro Almodóvar's direction is amazing and it's beautifully filmed. It's well paced and the music by Alberto Iglesias is excellent.,All About My Mother
909,All About My Mother,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1073927/,"Departing more and more from his more usual farcical style while retaining many of the elements that have made him the kind of storyteller he is today, Pedro Almodovar ended the year 2000 with a striking, passionate film that unless you had a rock for a heart you would never grasp its ultimate, compassionate essence.Manuela (Cecilia Roth) is at the center of this story, and through her unimaginable tragedy -- her son Esteban (Eloy Azorin) is killed in a freak accident while trying to get the autograph of his favorite theatre actress, Huma Rojo (played with great dignity by Spanish legend Marisa Paredes) -- she is able to reassemble the pieces of her life even though the people she encounters within her future bring her right back to her past.Almodovar films this in a completely non-exploitative way though there may be times when it feels as though it is, but being a Spanish film maker, I can see and appreciate where the growing passion reflected in many of its emotional scenes is coming from. The tragedies of these women, and of one of the more gender-confused men, all lead to that last gesture of maternal compassion, and the fact that Manuela decides to let her ex-lover Esteban, now a trans-gendered female, learn that not only did he have a son who died and loved him blindly but has another infant son borne from a nun (Penelope Cruz) is the core of what human relations are about: love which transcends errors, sex, character, even the absence of a father. A fascinating movie experience that resonates and brings the real Almodovar into the spotlight.",All About My Mother
910,Cast Away,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1701381/,"it's not my first time to see this movie but it's been a long time since i last saw it, so i found myself, this time, pondering over the high spiritual meanings in this zemeckis masterpiece and decided to share my thoughts with you.the idea that obsessed me after watching the movie is the spiritual aspect versus the physical one i.e spiritual loneliness versus physical/real one. the movie is inspired by Daniel Defoe's ""robinson Crusoe"", where the hero goes through a tough spiritual trial on an isolated island for 20 years, an experience which embodies the maxim of ""necessity is the mother of invention"".tom hanks is an employee at Fed Ex, he goes on a business trip to deliver some parcels, unfortunately the plane crashes, he miraculously survives but is thrown on an isolated island for four years. on the island he begins to search for every means to survive both spiritual and physical death. he manages to make a house, a fishing net, to light fire and finally make a boat that would take to the middle of the sea where he can find rescue.but the movie can't just be summarized in those few words it is the battle of man against the wildness of nature and the harshness of isolation. furthermore, it is man's journey inside himself, the hero discovered his abilities and re figured his true self when he was stuck in a situation where he can't find any hand. he was a strong person who didn't give up to the difficulties surrounding him everywhere. he rather managed to maintain hope, even if it is fake, find himself a source of consolation to overcome his loneliness and fill this void, emptiness, vacuum ...etc, he , thus, invented the character of ""wilson"", kept communicating with the picture of his beloved. i think,otherwise, he would have gone mad.when hanks goes back to his comfortable,civil life and joins his old community i felt that, may be, he is more lonely than he was on the island, then come the final scene to confirm my feelings. he is standing all alone at a crossroad not knowing which direction to follow or who to go to.Robert zemeckis did an excellent job in this unique movie. the shot sizes, the camera movement, the transitions, every visual element in the picture was perfect. the cinematography was also great especially the water scenes, the lighting was so convenient for the setting of the events.on the other side, tom hanks controlled this movie from the beginning to the end; though he scarcely spoke throughout the movie his performance was outstanding in addition to the physical effort he exerted in many scenes. it was very intelligent to make him lose a lot of weight, since he stayed four years on the island eating only crabs and coconuts.i remember the scene when hanks kept switching the lighter on and off several times after he came home, which sharply contrasts with the suffering he has gone through to light fire on the island. as for the final scene between Helen hunt and hanks, i found hunt so cold, just didn't like her.to cut it short, the movie was a masterpiece",Cast Away

918,Fireworks,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1712091/,"Takeshi Kitano's 'Hana-Bi' is something of an oddity. True to his previous efforts as director, the film contains its fair share of shockingly-graphic violence, and yet at its heart lies a touching tale of love, loyalty and devotion. For the entire running time, Kitano (who, aside from directing, also wrote and starred in the film) treads a perilously fine line between the two thematic extremes; it is an intricate balancing act that, if attempted by a less-talented filmmaker, might very possibly have turned into a complete cinematic disaster. Nevertheless, the director manages to pinpoint this perfect centre of balance, and the clash of beauty and violence combines to create a jarring amalgamation of conflicting emotional responses. We, as the audience, as simultaneously repulsed and entranced; as a whole, 'Hana-bi' is one of the most beautiful film experiences of the last decade or so.The title of the film itself acknowledges these opposing visual styles. Whilst the Japanese word 'Hanabi' translates to 'Fireworks' (the title under which it was released in the United States), the addition of the hyphen to the title ('Hana-bi') emphasises two individual components of the word, which translate respectively into ""Fire"" and ""Flower,"" the collision of destruction and beauty/renewal. Much of the film concerns a cop named Yoshitaka Nishi (Kitano), who is forced to retire after a shooting on the job leaves his partner, Horibe (Ren Osugi), paralysed, alone and confined to a wheelchair. All the while, Nishi is still coming to terms with the impending loss of his wife, Miyuki (Kayoko Kishimoto), who is slowly dying from leukemia. As any grieving husband might do in such a situation, Nishi decides to quietly rob a bank, and he then uses most of the proceeds to fund a final loving family holiday for his ailing partner.The scenes between Nishi and his wife are among the most touching I've ever witnessed. Miyuki has only two lines in the entire film, and so the couple spend most of their time in complete silence and quiet reflection, and yet you can truly sense the affection that they both have for each other. Their love is completely unspoken, and this makes it all the more touching when Miyuki does finally speak. Another touching character is Horibe, the loyal police force partner whose crippling injury leaves him alone and depressed. After attempting suicide, Horibe receives painting materials in the mail, and he commits his emotions to canvas, finally uncovering a reason for his continued existence (importantly, the artwork we see in the film was actually created by Kitano in 1994, after a near-fatal motorcycle accident). The film's phenomenally moving soundtrack was composed by renowned Japanese composer Joe Hisaishi, in his fourth collaboration with the director.There are very few negative criticisms that can be said of 'Hana-bi.' One possible item is that the film's unusual flashback structure made some plot-points difficult to follow, and I'm still unsure of which cop's lonesome widow Nishi was in the habit of visiting. However, that's the only critique that springs straight to mind. All in all, 'Hana-bi' is a gloriously assorted blend of violence, love and gentle humour, and a first viewing is not likely to be forgotten in a hurry.",Hana-Bi
919,Fireworks,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0419357/,"Hana-bi (1997) is Japanese film maker Takeshi Kitano's masterpiece along his Sonatine (1993). Hana-bi reminds me pretty much of his more recent film, Brother (2000), which still has much more humor and positivism in it. Those who have experienced Sonatine may ask can a film be even more beautiful and brilliant, but Hana-bi is at least as masterful, if also different. The film stars again the director himself as Nishi, a police man who learns his wife suffers from some extremely lethal disease which has taken her speech, too. She is going to die soon, and all Nishi has in his mind is to make his wife's last weeks as enjoyable and nice as possible. He is forced to deal with Yakuza in order to get some money for her medical care and other plans he has for her last days, and that leads of course to troubles with the gangsters as Nishi isn't able to pay back his loans. Nishi's partner is another tragic character, who is shot and paralyzed for the rest of his life during one shoot out. Also one of Nishi's partners is shot dead in a scene, which belongs to the film's most powerful scenes and it is shown as a flashback, in the usual silent and symbolic style of the director. What follows is all the great elements we've learned to wait from this artist from one of the greatest cinema lands in the world, Japan.Hana-bi is almost unbearably sad and emotional, and its most tragic character is Horibe, the partner who is paralyzed and totally abandoned by his wife and children after he loses his ability to move and be like his used to. The scenes in which Horibe tells to Nishi about his loneliness and that everyone has left him are extremely powerful and really make think about the values of one's own life for the second time. Horibe finds some kind of way to express his sadness through art and painting, and he gets a great gift from Nishi, one of his last friends who understands him and would never leave him like the others did.The shoot out flashback is also one memorable segment in this film, and it is in its slow motion one of the most beautiful, yet shocking depictions of violence ever possible. Hana-bi has some very strong scenes of violence, and it all erupts again as rapidly as always in Takeshi's films. Weak souls resort to violence very often, and the result is always just more violence, death, depravity and pain, both physical and emotional. I will stress again that those who think Takeshi's cinema is gratuitously violent (or Japanese cinema in general, i.e. the work of Takashi Miike and Ishii) miss the whole point as his films absolutely never glorify violence or present it as a noteworthy tool; his films analyze violence and show many aspects of it, without hiding or embellishing anything. His films are as important in this level as they are in cinematic element level as some of his usual trademarks are absolutely unique and stunning, and Hana-bi is definitely not an exception.The music is again by Joe Hisaishi, who composed Takeshi's films Sonatine and Brother plus some others. The soundtrack in Hana-bi is again one key element of the film, and it is perhaps closer to Brother's than Sonatine's, but still all these three films have unique and masterful soundtrack which is full of emotions. The greatest element of all, however, in Hana-bi are the paintings by the director himself, who painted them after his nearly fatal motorcycle accident in 1994. They are stunningly beautiful and staggering as they combine different types of nature's beauty in very unique way. The animals combined with flowers are so wonderfully effective and their power is taken even further by the music. This symbolism creates so powerful experience that it almost requires the viewer to cry for the characters, but also for the cinematic magic this director has created.
The usual wry humor of Takeshi is almost completely missing in Hana-bi, but there are some little bits, which are still in right places and work as fine as they always do. Still, this is the most inconsolable film of Takeshi, and be sure to watch the whole film the end credits included, since there's one extremely purifying image coming, in the tradition of the finale in Brother. Despite Hana-bi being so sad and harrowing, the very end is again very relieving and belongs among the greatest endings of all time. Another film with similar ultra-powerful image at the end is Lars von Trier's Breaking the Waves, another masterpiece from the 90's.I just cannot imagine loving some other film maker's work more than Takeshi's, and he is among the greatest cinematic artist I know, and it is not a surprise he's from Japan, since Asian film makers are usually the most personal and stunning and don't have any restrictions for their work like in Hollywood film makers usually have as they have to keep the ratings and commercial things in mind. Fortunately Takeshi has been able to do his films completely free, and I really hope he can continue it for many years to come. Hana-bi is his brightest masterpiece. 10/10 immortal cinema.",Hana-bi
920,The Game,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1989184/,"I have to say I didn't expect this. I didn't have great expectations when I saw this. Especially considering the cold reception given to it by critics and audiences alike. But it is one of the most original Hollywood thrillers ever.The story is about an investment banker named Nicholas Van Orton(Michael Douglas in one of his best roles) who is greedy and self centred and who lives alone in his huge mansion. His brother(Sean Penn) gives him a card telling him to contact the company and it is his birthday present to him. What follows is absolute edge of the seat stuff and it shows David fincher at a time when he made some of the finest movies ever seen in Hollywood. In the midst of all this, he meets a waitress named Christine. Revealing more might spoil the movie for you as it is a fun roller-coaster ride with many twists and turns.What impressed me about this movie was the atmosphere throughout the movie. It is classic David fincher with the dark tone and great background music. The camera work is excellent especially in the scene where his father falls down to his death. These scenes also show another side to Nicholas van orton and indicate why he became the way he is. He starts out as a one dimensional guy but then when faced with crisis he shows so many sides. I feel the game is more a character study because it shows the myriad changes in his behaviour throughout the movie. Rather than depending on gimmicky twists and quick editing(which is the popular way of making movies today), The Game depends solely on atmosphere and the strength of its performances. Deborah Kara Unger gives a great performance as a character with shades of grey. She is the perfect person for this character with her mysterious look. Sean penn as usual gives a great performance but unfortunately he doesn't have much screen time.Another aspect of the movie is the dark humor. Michael Douglas gives certain comments with a deadpan delivery that makes it even more humorous. In many ways the Game can be described as a satire on society and how people forget the most important things in life when pursuing success. It is interesting how facing a crisis brings out the most basic emotions in people and how it changes people is the basic theme of this movie. We experience the same emotions as Nicholas and thus it becomes a ride where we don't know the truth till the last moment.I had tears in my eyes at the end and the credit should go to the direction and the music. The slow motion sequence at the end is also well done and this has got to be one of the best endings of all time.10/10",The Game
921,Breaking the Waves,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0959438/,"Lars von Trier's Breaking the Waves is the kind of film that makes me proud to be a film-goer and exceeds anything I could have possibly expected from the man who made Element of Crime. That film had some clever experimentation (and so does this one) but this film is the kind that's beauty and power echoes in your mind hours after you've watched it. This is a flabbergasting work of art that portrays a woman's quest to please God and does so with the complexity and emotional power of a Bergman film (not to mention the fact that the film portrays a woman's intense suffering in world sternly ruled by men with the power of a Dreyer film). If von Trier made nothing else of any merit for the rest of his career, if all he did was make marginally interesting film experiments, I wouldn't hesitate to call him a great filmmaker on the soul basis of this film. Anyway, you get the picture The film stars Emily Watson as Bess, a shy and neurotic girl who is filled with joy to be with her new husband Jan (Stellan Skarsgard who is exceptional). When Jan is paralyzed after an accident at the oilrig he works in, he is in danger of losing his life. He convinces Bess to see other people and Bess wants nothing more than to make him happy and to prove to God that she loves him. After some disastrous complications, Bess is led to believe that she can please God and save Jan's life by having numerous sexual encounters with strangers in town. This sounds like a grungy tale, but von Trier tells it with such humanism and focus on his themes that we never feel like he is rubbing our faces in drear. And Watson is delightful, frightening, and heartbreaking as a woman who will stop at nothing to please those around her. Her one-sided conversations with God (in which she looks up in the air submissively and pleas and then looks down with a deep voice of wrath and scolds) are both funny and sad, not to mention the fact that they reveal seemingly endless amounts of details about who she is. The film is made with a hand-held camera and a visually stunning solarized style. This style does not make the movie; it just adds richness to each scene in the way it gives each face such shadowy texture. In the end, von Trier seems to believe in God but does not believe in the churches that try to codify what he wants. All of this works because of von Trier's passionate desire to understand how one can please God under horrendous terms; the epilogue, that takes the already-great material to a new level and shows how inspired von Trier is, starts with a moment of sad irony and then leaps to the skies with an image that fills the most atheistic person with questions and the more religiously spiritual people with hope. Here is a film that reaches for the stars and makes it there.",Breaking the Waves
922,Ed Wood,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0338094/,"I hear that ED WOOD took just $6,000,000 on its initial cinematic release in the USA.  I'm not surprised.  The extraordinary thing is that the film was financed and released at all.  Had it not been for the prestige that Tim Burton had already earned from his previous projects, ED WOOD would no doubt have foundered long before the cameras began to roll.  The result could have been another 1941  but it wasn't.  What came out of Tim Burton's fascination with the `Worst Director of All Time' was something very rich and strange  perhaps the most un-Hollywood Hollywood picture of the 90s.I see two main themes in ED WOOD.  The first is the dreadful fear that hovers over everyone who enters the creative arts  `Am I any good?'  `Is my work any good?'  `How do I know if it's any good?'  `What if I think it's good, but everybody else thinks it's rubbish?'  Artists use all kinds of strategies to deal with these fears  some become eccentric, others arrogant, others diffident.  Without the right to fail, no artist is likely to take the sort of risk that sometimes, just sometimes, leads to great work.  Tim Burton knew this.Edward D Wood Jnr believed himself to be a creative artist.  Oh, how he believed.  But he still failed to create anything worthwhile.  And this leads to what I believe to be the second theme of the movie, and the reason why I think it failed commercially.Look at all the things Ed did right.  He believed in himself.  He followed his dream.  He worked hard.  He was an entrepreneur  he did his best to make others believe in his dream and help him to turn it into reality.  In short, he did all the things that the self-help books, the daytime TV shows, the junk ballads and the feel-good movies tell us will give you success. Just wish upon a star, work all the hours there are to turn your vision into reality and you will succeed.  Ed did all of these things.  And still he failed.  He died short of his 60th birthday, living in a crime-riddled apartment building, drunk, broke, supporting himself and his loyal wife Kathy by writing formula pornography and making sex instruction flicks on 8mm.America doesn't want to hear this.  Hollywood doesn't want to tell America this  that you can try and try and try and still get nothing but heartbreak.  This is why ED WOOD is such an un-Hollywood film  and why it's one of the best Hollywood films of the 90s.",Ed Wood
923,Ed Wood,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0338256/,"Without question it's Tim Burton's best, most complete work and Johnny Depp is superb. Perhaps it's the total understanding of his subject that allows Tim Burton to fly so high here. The beautifully tailored script gives room for some exquisite character drawings, Martin Landau as Bela Lugosi, Vincent D'Onofrio as Orson Wells. ""When you re-write a script it gets better and better"" tells Ed/Johnny to his girlfriend with a smile full of innocence. What a performance! Johnny Depp is a unique kind of actor, we never had anyone quite like him. How can he manage to disappear behind a character and still bring with him his full bag of tricks, I don't know, but he does. I only wish he wouldn't get lost in mediocrities like ""Nick of Time"" ""The Astronaut's Wife"" and ""Secret Window"" He belongs to the world of real, great filmmakers. Better to risk with an original idea by Emir Kusturica than a ""safe"", tired, Stephen King thing. Johnny, remember, we're looking at you for clues about ourselves. More Ed Woods , please!",Ed Wood

Boom. Boom.""This movie belongs to three actors. Personally I think Di Caprio deserves the Oscar that year. Taking nothing away from Tommy Lee Jones (an actor I like) in The Fugitive, but I think he was the least deserving that year. amongst some great nominees. Depp (with a gingerish hair do) is the movies emotional core and continues to be great. His face and eyes are so expressive. And finally Darlene Cates as Gilbert's obese mother.Juliette Lewis, Mary Steenburgen, Kevin Tighe and John C Rielly are all good but the movie belongs to those 3.It's a slow burner and I can see why it's not for everyone, but I enjoy think it's great. No over use of CGI or special effects at all. No gun fights or chases. Just wonderful performances telling a story.What's Eating Gilbert Grape recieved good reviews and Di Caprio was nominated for an Oscar, but the movie only grossed $10 million at the domestic box office, not landing a place on the top 100 highest grossing movie of the year.",What's Eating Gilbert Grape
925,What's Eating Gilbert Grape,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0331840/,"What's Eating Gilbert Grape is one of those little treasures that for the most part most people do know about, mainly due to Leonardo DiCaprio's knock out performance as Arnie Grape. But both he and Johnny had this great chemistry together that made what could have been a very boring movie into an extremely touching piece of film that meant more and more to me as I grew up. When I was a kid and watched this film, I just loved laughing at all of Arnie's jokes not realizing why he was so silly. As a teenager I could start to relate to having a little more pressure with a job and school. Then as an adult and having my mother become ill, I could relate completely to Gilbert in his frustrations of just wanting to be young and enjoy his life. I think that's why this film is special to a lot of people, those who have felt the added little pressures in life and makes you think on what's eating at you? This is the story of Gilbert Grape.In the small town of Endora, Gilbert Grape is busy caring for his mentally handicapped brother, Arnie. His morbidly obese mother, Bonnie has done little except eat since her husband died, and longs only to see Arnie live to the age of 18. With Bonnie unable to care for her children on her own, Gilbert has taken responsibility for repairing the old house and looking after Arnie, who has a habit of climbing the town water tower, while his sisters Amy and Ellen do the rest. The relationship between the brothers is of both care and protection, as Gilbert continually enforces the 'nobody touches Arnie' policy. A new ""Foodland"" supermarket has opened, threatening the small Lamson's Grocery where Gilbert works. In addition, Gilbert is having an affair with a married woman, Betty Carver. The family is looking forward to Arnie's 18th birthday. A young woman named Becky and her grandmother are stuck in town when their car breaks down. Gilbert's unusual life circumstances threaten to get in the way of their possible romance. His affair with Mrs Carver ends when she leaves town in search of a new life following her husbands death,. Becky becomes close to both Gilbert and Arnie and as she talks to Gilbert she begins to unlock some buried hopes, dreams and happiness. Later on, Arnie tries to run away yet again from his bath and in his frustration Gilbert finally snaps, hitting Arnie several times. Guilty and appalled at himself, Gilbert takes the car and runs out without another word, fearing that he is leaving his family just like his father and brother did.What's Eating Gilbert Grape is just an incredibly beautiful and touching movie that will always have a special place in my heart. It makes you laugh, cry, and think about how precious life is. All the characters are relatable or likable in some way. Even in the smallest of all towns where it seems like it's just dead, there is life. That's what this movie is about to me, everyone has a story and everyone has an experience to share. This is just a terrific film, quality acting and a heart felt story, I very much recommend that if you get the chance to watch it. If anything for Leonardo DiCaprio's incredible performance and Johnny Depp singing to him ""Match in the gas tank, boom boom!"".10/10",What's Eating Gilbert Grape
926,Tombstone,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1737664/,"Probably the best Western I have ever seen, if mostly due to Kilmer's outstanding portrayal as Doc Holliday. He lacks, in my opinion, much of the gruffness of John Wayne which, although good, gets boring after so many films. The look on Ringo's face when he realises his opponent is Holliday, not Earp, is priceless, and shows you just how great a reputation Doc has that a man praised as ""The deadliest pistoleer since Wild Bill"" is now making excuses not to go up against him. Russel's performance is also commendable, showing a man who has seen too much blood in his life and wishes simply to settle down, but Kilmer simply cannot be ignored as the drunken but suave gambler.",Tombstone

928,The Remains of the Day,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2055008/,"This is the Quintessential period piece! The flow of it is so seamless, that like classical music or a beautiful piece of art - you never tire of it. It marks the end of the expansion of prosperity, change and invention of the Victorian and Edwardian eras, that for the first time in history, brought into existence a large, educated middle class. It is the span of this society and it's events that were both passed on to us as a nation, and have had a greater influence on our modern day than any other period. As they were the beginning of the modern era. By the 1930's we come to the end of the rigid class system that had evolved during these periods. This story is in fact all about the servants and is seen from their perspective. Regular working class people, their lives and loves - they are it's real champions. I believe it to be the finest film ever made on the subject, and one of the finest films period. Easy on both the eyes and the mind, it is effortless to watch. And one of only 3 films that I find myself returning to over and over again, more than any others. Anthony Hopkins and Emma Thompson who have so many great performances, do their best work here. Here in cinema is a display of excellence in the ordinary, and a celebration of both understatement, and unrequited love. We are only observers here in the sense that there is nothing to figure out, and what we observe is the perfect Servant. One who applies himself wholeheartedly to his craft, and finds contentment in doing his job well. A rarity in both life and cinema. I find it very telling that perhaps the finest English film was a collaboration of men from two former colonies - India and the U.S., a Japanese author, a Celt in the male lead, and a screenwriter from Germany married to an Indian, who has spent most of her life in India and America. These are the people that school us in the culture that birthed our own, and so much of modern western civilization. None of them are English.The perfect fit that I think James Ivory often reaches for is achieved here. It is a movie without sex, violence, or bad language, which are often added from a lack of strength, not as proof of it. This movie is a tribute to everything good that is England. Merchant and Ivory couldn't have done better.http://fullgrownministry.wordpress.com/2013/04/08/true-faith/",N/A
929,The Remains of the Day,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1197055/,"Wow, what a wonderful movie this turned out to be!I didn't check this movie out until the fall of 2004 after reading a number of positive reviews, enough to pique my curiosity. I was glad I did. In fact, I was so impressed with this film that a week later I went out and bought the book, which is even better. First of all, the film is a tremendous visual treat. There are some great interior scenes of the Darlington mansion, and great colors inside and in the surrounding outside scenery. This is simply a beautiful film. Second, the acting of Anthony Hopkins and Emma Thompson was spectacular. They were riveting. The way they deliver dialog and the expressions of their faces.....magnificent acting. Thompson's sad look in the back of the bus near the end of the movie is the saddest, most haunting look on a person's face I have ever seen in 50 years of movie watching. Hopkins, one of the best actors of this generation, provides a tremendous character study of a man who has been taught that to be the best in his profession, he must suppress all emotion. In doing so, he never learns to think for himself and he misses out on what could have been the love of his life. In that regards, this is a very frustrating story.However, this isn't just a tragic romantic story. Hopkins' character is wonderful example, too, of unselfish devotion and dignified servitude in the face of any kind of circumstance. This is an extremely beautiful, intelligent and sensitive film.

930,Naked,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0325874/,"If you liked Pi or The Cruise then you should check out Naked. It's an amazing exploration of a man descended into nihilism, who leaves victims of his intellectual bullying (and misogyny) everywhere. No, it's not PC. Yes, it feels so real. Sorry to gush, but I loved this film.I like American Existential Anti-Heroes. I wasn't really prepared to confront an English Existential Anti-Hero. Wow, what a different take on a similar stimulus.This film is a monument to gritty realism, without being self-conscious about it. You can taste this movie. But you never feel like it was faked or forced. The camera work and the lighting never get in the way. I usually notice such things, and here it was invisible and completely immersive. David Thewlis throws every bit of his body into this movie. Even the great closing credit scene.I would be remiss if I didn't point out the fantastic black humor, especially since some people said it wasn't funny! Sophie wails in the most sustained way I have ever seen in drama. And it's hysterical, even as you're hurting with her. The frantic Scottish kid made me rewind again and again. While I agree that the ""landlord"" character could have been over the top, his reaction to Johnny flailing on the floor made me laugh out loud. The two characters are really barely distinguishable but that one is a dandy and the other has a fondness for the gutter. As the poster-hanger beats the crap out of our anti-hero you can't help but laugh. And then you nod along as Louise tells him he had it coming in her terrific and constant deadpan (with an occasional suggestion of a smile).As our protagonist points out, in the end, all the books, and all the learning, and all the discussion, still don't help you understand the point of the cruel joke of life. Yes, it's an old dorm-room discussion that freshman are still having for the 1st time. But that doesn't make the question and the questioning any less desperate. It is human to cry out in pain, even when it's self-inflicted. The references to making a choice for self-destruction are throughout the dialogue, but not so much so that they hit you in the head.Naked is depressing and euphoric at the same time. Yes it's often ""awful"", but how can you not cheer for someone who loves life and is trying his hardest to fully engage it? And not one character (or question) gets a pat Hollywood ending or moral -- woo-hoo!This movie is why people can call film a legitimate art form. It provokes thought, it is drama, and it is beautiful. It thrills me.Someone asked if the dialogue was improvised.

931,Naked,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0325842/,"Having a bad day? Then check out Mike Leigh's masterpiece; the tale of Johnny, a mid twenties Mancunian drifter who heads down to London (having nicked a car) and tracks down an old girlfriend. He seduces Sophie (the excellent Katrin Cartlidge), unleashes a display of venom on his old lover, Louise (Lesley Sharp) and staggers off into the night when both women become too much for him to bear. His odyssey takes him to a world of the homeless, including an illiterate Scot (Trainspotting's Ewen Bremner) and his long suffering girlfriend (Susan Vidler) and a lonely nightwatchman (Peter Wight) guarding empty space. It's during this lengthy scene that David Thewlis proves to be one of the most versatile actors of his generation, delivering a speech of bleak complexity and pre-millennial doom that leaves most viewers reeling. Juxtaposed with Johnny is Louise's rapist Yuppie landlord (Greg Cruttwell), perhaps the weakest character in the movie. He's rich, crass and brutal, but also appears to be a sneering cartoon character, overshadowed by Johnny's hard edged intellect. Naked is the flip side of Leigh's previous movie, Life is Sweet. A bitter tale of loneliness, depression and Thatcher's wasted youth that seemed to be forgotten by most home grown film-makers in the mad rush to emulate Wall Street. Had a bad day?

The script of the movie, which is a mix between a gangster story and a drama, is unique and the actors are splendid. It's nice to see Robert De Niro starring in a gangster movie without being one of the gangsters himself. The movie is cool, emotional and has a deeper morally message at the same time which is why the movie is still printed in my mind today, two years since I saw it the last time. a one of a kind movie which I will not hesitate to salute with a maximum score of 10!

934,A Bronx Tale,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0319369/,"This might be a matter of taste, but ""A Bronx Tale"" remains Number 2 on list of Favorite Movies of All Time.  It just happens to be one of the most deeply moving, powerful films I've ever encountered.  Yes, some may consider this a simple story, but that's the beauty of it.  It's a down-to-earth, coming-of-age story that perfectly mirrors the life of a boy like C growing up in the Bronx at such a hectic time.  Of course, this is based on Chazz Palminteri's real life experiences, and I envy Chazz, being an aspiring screenwriter/director.  I wish I had life experiences like that to put on film.  And I have to commend my man Bobby D for bringing these images to life in such a vibrant, engrossing way.DeNiro captures every element of the 1960's Bronx, with a great opening sequence featuring doo-wop singers sweetly singing the movie's theme.  He captures so many elements of the period, and it was nice to see only one goof was captured.  It was interesting to find out that most of the movie was actually shot in Brooklyn--my hometown.  Then again, the two places are alike in their own simple ways.  Bobby D has a short, but memorable role (which is against type) as a working-class bus driver.  He's desperately trying to get by and support his son, Cologero (I think that's how to spell it...LOL), and disapproves of his son's new ""job"" with gangster Sonny (Chazz, who gives a landmark performance).  The interactions between DeNiro and his son are extraordinary in the way they mirror the way a real father and son would argue in those situations.  As I said, it's the whole down-to-earth quality of this movie that I think made it tick.  It's nothing pretentious.  This is a simple movie about humanity.  The gangster plot is merely a backdrop. 
The only other movie I've seen him in was ""Crimson Tide"" in a very small role, but Lillo Brancato (who plays DeNiro's son in the later years) is a revalation!  He gives one of the best performances I've ever seen and I'm surprised I haven't seen him in any more recent movies.  And I have to say DeNiro did a dynamic job of casting.  As far as I know, Brancato and Bobby aren't related, but please tell me if I'm wrong, because they look EXACTLY alike!  If you've seen any of DeNiro's very early films, Brancato is a mirror image of him.  Is it coincidence or what?  I've rarely seen a film where the son/daughter even directly resembles the parents, but Brancato has the DeNiro nose and everything.  If you observe closely, there's a scene where Brancato is wearing a black jacket and a black hat, and if you were to see this in a split-screen with DeNiro in ""Mean Streets"" it would be uncanny.  There are so many people I have to commend for this film.  That also includes the supporting cast.  Taral Hicks as C's love interest was also impressive.  And of course, you can't have a movie directed by DeNiro and starring DeNiro without his main amigo making an appearance.  Hopefully, you haven't read the cast list on the IMDB.  Because I was surprised and overjoyed when ""the man"" appeared in the final scene. 
There are many lessons on life to be drawn out of this film, some of which given by Chazz's character Sonny, who plays the most likeable gangster I've seen in cinema.  Yet at the same time, you can't consider him ""too nice."" Which was a good move.  Sonny was a nice guy in the core, yet he still has a heart of a gangster.  In a great monologue, he explains how he'd rather be feared than loved.  And of course there's the great monlogue that everyone remembers:  the car door scene.  That was really an unforgettable speech. Plus, there's funny moments, too.  The gambling scene in the basement, for example.  ""Get in the f**king bathroom!!!""  LOL...that was hilarious. 
To add to the emotional intensity, we have an interracial relationship between Brancato and Hicks at a time when Bronx was heavily segregated and whites wanted absolutely nothing to do with blacks.  The scene where the boys beat those innocent black boys down was an extremely powerful scene. And through DeNiro's direction, we feel the characters' every emotion.  I like how he used the doo-wop music to contribute to the soundtrack.By the end, I was almost at tears.  I'm virtually tearing up just writing this review and looking at this masterful drama in retrospect.  This is something ONLY Bobby D and Chazz could've done!  No one could've done it better!  For me to be this deeply moved by a motion picture is unprecedented.  I wish I could be thanking the two guys in person.If anyone hasn't seen this movie, please don't hesitate to pick it up!  This is one of those great, underrated masterpieces that you feel sad after finding out about its poor success.

The writing is top-notch, in no-way predictable and the voice acting by Kevin Conroy as Batman and Mark Hamill as the Joker truly amazing and bone-chillingly scary.The only complaints is that the animation could have been better at some points, but that is because it was originally meant to be a straight to video release before Warner's saw what a masterpiece they had created, and also it should have run for a little bit longer, but oh well.

936,Hard Boiled,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0983360/,"There can be few cop movies which can boast a body count higher than Spielberg's entire Omaha Beach Landing in the first 5 minutes. Possibly no cop film except, of course, Hard Boiled.Hard Boiled is John Woo's Hong Kong swansong, and many regard it as his finest film. It stars young Chow Yun-Fat and Tony Leung Chiu Wai, two of the finest actors in Hong Kong; the usual ""maverick cop hunts big boss bad guy"" routine; oh, and lots and lots of blood. Imagine a slightly more realistic version of the Arnie midi-gun sequence in T2  more realistic in that when someone starts firing a midi-gun and blowing up cars, the cops get killed. That, in a nutshell, is the plot of Hardboiled. All two hours and six minutes of it.The plot  well that makes about as much sense as a wolverine in a fruit salad, but I'm not sure addicts of HK Cinema care too much about that. Tequila (maverick cop and certified nutcase with a heart of gold - Chow Yun Fat) shouts and swears at his boss, shoots up bad guys, gets drunk and ends up (implausibly, if iconically) in a hospital, holding a baby in one hand and a shot gun in the other. Tony Leung lives Miami Vice-Style on a boat (alas, no Alligator) while committing murder, getting paid by the HK Police, and wearing loose tee-shirts with white jackets.If all this sounds like style over substance  erm that's 'cos it is.The film definitely has its moments. In fact, like most John Woo films, it seems mostly to be a series of moments strung together to feature length. It also has some real grit. I appreciated the scene where a regular cop kills an undercover cop by mistake in a raid. Realistic, and not something that Hollywood would ever broach (the closest to this is in a truly class film like The Reservoir Dogs).However, while this is a true Hong Kong bullets and ballet classic, Western audiences are likely to feel slightly cheated by its totally bonkers story. Less bonkers than many, perhaps, but that's not really saying much.I enjoyed it. It was a guilty pleasure, but I'm man enough to admit I enjoyed it. John Woo has yet to make a better film. And has never yet made a sensible one, so don't blame him or me if you find it a bit daft. 5/10 (but watchable).",Hard Boiled
937,Night on Earth,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1494083/,"It's at times a little telegraphed, even heavy handed; the links between the five stories being arbitrary, almost tenuous introductions to another morality tale, but there's lots to like regardless. Roberto Benigni is excellent as the offbeat cab driver who likes the company of pumpkins and sheep, and his funny segment is juxtaposed quite beautifully with the more heartfelt and raw finale. My favourite segment, however, is the equally funny New York section starring Giancarlo Esposito, which is basically a culture clash between a working-class New Yorker and a foreign immigrant's first night driving a taxi. It balances both the humour and drama perfectly, a harmony which isn't met so successfully in the rest of the film. Yet, Jim Jarmusch's tale about disparate lives intermingling during one night is both original, bold (filming across the world and in native languages has to be applauded), poignant, and very funny.",N/A
938,Night on Earth,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0297285/,"Since I have almost seventeen years of experience in the taxi business as a dispatcher and driver, I have to say that ""Night on Earth"" is one of my favorite movies! This movie gives a very real and comical portrayal of life in this line of work. I've known people who were given great opportunities, and rejected them. I've personally kicked drunk idiots out of my cab. I've had blind people tell me which route to take. I've had people who were so ""down and out"" tell me their life story. This is a film that portrays what taxi driving is all about, and it is not limited to the USA. People are the same all over the world! This movie is not yet available on DVD in the USA, but I really hope it will be soon!",Night on Earth
939,The Double Life of Véronique,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0293479/,"Cinema--it is said or more accurately theorized--was originally intended as a way to create an experience that can be shared by all. However, while watching this film for the first time, and the many times i've experienced it since, i've felt, like almost all the characters in this picture, a profound sense of loss and loneliness.An absolute magical exploration on the duality and also the polarity of identical strangers, The double life of Veronique is a film you MUST watch very closely and pay strict attention to. Every scene of this film, in some respect, matches other scenes to come. You'll have to pay attention to subtle clues and details as well as the metaphorical film language to notice them. Fear not! THIS isn't some kind of intellectual thinking persons picture. HOWEVER some profound questions are raised here about the very existence of SELF as well as the definition or what we define as human experience.There isn't much you can say about this film that hasn't already been said and if you've never heard it said please allow me to say it: This is one of the greatest films ever made and I strongly recommend watching this film alone. Why alone? Perhaps this is odd to say but the loneliness that haunts this film is surprisingly comforting. Only the magician (Krystoff Keislowski, Director) knows what he intended for the viewer when he made this. For the true answer go ahead and drift into the unique world that this film offers and allow yourself to be a part of cinema's greatest lullaby.",The Double Life of Veronique
940,The Double Life of Véronique,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1249835/,"St. Veronica, often called the patron saint of photographers, was, according to legend, one of the women who followed Christ to his crucifixion. At one point she handed the weary savior a cloth to wipe his face on. He did so, and when he handed it back to her, there was imprinted an image of his face on the cloth. The name Veronica, indeed, is a corruption of the Latin ""vero icon"" - the true image (yes, a contradiction in terms, I know). When Kieslowski's Veronika is unknowingly walking to her death, that is, to the audition that will lead to it, the French Veronique unknowingly photographs her from the bus in the Krakow square, while frantically trying to get snapshots from the ongoing riot.Veronika, of course, ends up straining herself too hard singing, and because of her heart condition, snuffs it while singing those beautiful lines from Dante's Paradisio, about the ascent to heaven. Veronique, in turn, for some reason realizes that she has to give up her own singing career, and, seemingly without a single moment of regret, instead dedicates herself to teaching the music of Van den Budenmaier to untalented, bratty schoolchildren. There is little doubt, after watching the movie, that the Polish Veronika did indeed, somehow, die so that the French Veronique might live.The opening sequence of the movie also contains the outline of Christ's life. Veronika is shown ""the star that will start Chrismas Eve"" (oh, the horrifically nonsensical astronomy we teach our children... but I digress. ;-) ), and immediately afterwords we are taken to France, where the child Veronique is being told about the leaves of spring. Christmas is the birth of Christ, while spring is the time of Easter, and his suffering and death.So, is this, indeed, Kieslowski's very radical, and breathtakingly beautiful, take on the story of the suffering of Christ? Discuss, class. ;-)",N/A
941,Misery,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0285826/,"Writer William Goldman and director Rob Reiner do Hitchcock proud with this one. It has all the elements: a seemingly innocent place and situation invaded by a growing sense of sinister dread until a breathtaking climax. The intelligent script is peppered with moments that will either make you cringe or make you laugh, depending on how morbid your sense of humor is. It is a harrowing movie to watch the first time around. The crew has done a good job of making you feel Paul Sheldon's pain. Few films torture the audience like this one. In fact, I venture to say this is the best film of its kind since ""Psycho"" thirty years earlier.The acting is good all-round. Farnsworth steals every scene he's in with his sardonic and relentless sheriff - he did not get enough accolades for what would have been a routine part in a lesser actor's hands. Caan is solid and underplays beautifully, and the inimitable Kathy Bates carries the film with her alternately hysterical or ridiculously-sappy Annie, the psychotic Sheldon fan. Her performance is a throwback to Hollywood's old days - it's not subtle, not quiet, and borders on over-acting. This is not method acting, this is showing off. But Bates makes it work, investing Annie with enough pitifulness to make the character complex and, thus, hold the role together. This movie is famous, of course, for making Kathy Bates an overnight sensation as everybody went into the movie wanting to see what Sonny Corleone looked like as an older man, but left with accolades for Kathy Bates on their lips. She is absolutely terrifying and unforgettable in this role and perfect for it. Brilliant performance that elevated a 7-star thriller to 9-10 classic status.",Misery
942,Misery,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0285833/,"Based on the novel by him, 'Misery' is a real Stephen King film. It is a drama film, but also a thriller and sometimes even a horror. In one scene the horror is very clear, you will know what scene I mean.Writer Paul Sheldon (James Caan) gets in a car accident. He is helped by Annie Wilkes (Kathy Bates) who claims she is his number one fan. In his latest novel Sheldon has killed the favorite character of Annie making her a little mad. She keeps Sheldon in her home; he has to bring the character back to life in his next novel.Bates, who won an Oscar, is terrific as Annie, one of her finest performances. James Caan who is in bed or a wheelchair most of the film is very convincing. The room he is living in is one of those spaces in the movies you will not forget very soon. Directed by Rob Reiner this is a great film, although it could be a bit slow for some from time to time.",Misery

This movie is fantastic!While it may be a rehashed version of a popular Japanese book, our buddy Miyazaki gave it an excellent treatment. Production costs for this movie almost broke Ghibli's bank in 1989, and it shows. It looks great, it sounds great, and it feels great. We start with a young witch named Kiki. She's closing the gap on 13, which is the time when young witches must leave home and forge a life of their own for one full year. After a bittersweet ""goodbye,"" she finds herself in a beautiful oceanside town. At first, she's treated with bewildered looks and sneers (after all, how crazy would it be if some random little girl on a broom started buzzing around YOUR house?). But before long, she institutes a flying delivery service and becomes a local star. Every bit of this movie is worth watching. I have nothing negative to say at all. From first frame to last, it's a classic. No, a legend.",Kiki's Delivery Service
944,Glory,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2586422/,"Classic Civil War film with an interesting screenplay written by Kevin Jarre , based on the personal letters of Colonel Robert Gould Shaw, and the novel Lay This Laurel, by Lincoln Kirstein . Robert Gould Shaw leads the US Civil War's first all-black volunteer company, fighting prejudices of both his own Union army and the Confederates . The story is based on the 54th Massachusetts Volunteer Infantry, the first formal unit of the US Army to be made up entirely of African American men, as told from the point of view of Colonel Robert Gould Shaw (Matthew Broderick) , its commanding officer during the American Civil War. Captain Robert Gould Shaw leads a company of Union soldiers from a Massachusetts Infantry Regiment in an attack on Confederate troops at the Battle of Antietam, on September 17, 1862. His regiment suffers heavy losses, Shaw is wounded, and later loses consciousness. He is awakened by a black gravedigger named John Rawlins (Morgan Freeman) and sent to a field hospital. While receiving medical attention, Shaw is told that President Lincoln is on the verge of passing the Emancipation Proclamation; freeing slaves in rebel held territory. While on leave in Boston, Shaw is promoted to Colonel, and given command of the 54th Massachusetts Volunteer Infantry, the first all-black regiment . Shaw was approached by his father (Peter Michael Goetz) while in camp in late 1862 to take command of a new All-Black Regiment and writes a letter her mother (Jane Alexander) . He accepts the assignment , and asks his friend , Cabot Forbes (Gary Elwes), to be his second-in-command . At first he declined the offer, but after careful thought he accepted the position. Shaw's letters clearly state that he was dubious about a free black unit succeeding, but the dedication of his men deeply impressed him, and he grew to respect them as fine soldiers. On learning that black soldiers would receive less pay than white ones, he inspired his unit to conduct a boycott until this inequality was rectified . Their first volunteer soldier is another of Shaw's friends, an educated black man named Thomas Searles (Andre Braugher). Later on , join other African-American soldiers (an utter all-star-cast : Morgan Freeman , Denzel Washington) and a tough Sergeant Major Mulcahy (John Finn). At the ending , Shaw volunteers the 54th infantry to lead an assault on Fort Wagner. After nightfall, he leads the men in a charge upon the fort. Numerous soldiers in the regiment charge up the parapet and die in the fighting too .This wonderful film with an enormous attention to period detail is full of thrills , with battle scenes are truly breathtaking , historical events and moving scenes . Intelligent in its storytelling drama , it turns to be a thought-provoking and powerful story with several emotive moments . The picture's strength belongs to the powerhouse secondary casting with top-notch performances from Morgan Freeman , Andre Braugher , Jihmi Kennedy , Cliff De Young , Bob Gunton , Richard Rhiele , Donovan Leitch among others . Epic and stirring final battle carried out by Shaw volunteers the 54th infantry to lead an assault on Fort Wagner . Colorful cinematography by the British Freddie Francis , a magnificent cameraman and also filmmaker . Special mention to the marvelous soundtrack, composed by James Horner in conjunction with the Boys Choir of Harlem , one of the best of the cinema's history . Lavishly produced by TriStar and stunningly directed by Edward Zwick .The film deservedly received Academy Award nominations for Best Editing and Best Art Direction. It won a number of awards from the British Academy Awards and the Golden Globes. Denzel Washington won the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor for his splendid portrayal of Trip , the proud and upright soldier . Rating : Above average , two thumbs up , it's long overdue and moving tribute to the African-American soldiers who fought for the Union cause in the Civil War . This is an admirable effort with true social significance that results to be surprisingly entertaining.",Glory
945,The Killer,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0987973/,I first watched the killer on recommendation i thought i would hate it...how wrong i was.It was obvious i was watching a classic from the opening credits with a lingering shot of hong kong and a somewhat sad tune playing in the background. The story starts with ah jong an assassin hired to pull off a hit job at a nightclub during the assassination he accidentally blinds a piano singer-jenny.Feeling guilty for what he has done he decides the only way to redeem himself is too help her get a cornea transplant and the rest...you will have to find out yourself.John woo is known for directing heart pounding action sequences and these are as heart pounding as they get the final shoot out in the church is tense and exciting.The cinematography is excellent and often beautiful th camera works wonders and extreme close ups of faces are used effectively SPOILERS AHEAD.The ending of the killer is possibly the most downbeat in the history of cinema and nearly brought me too tears(ah jong's eyes explode after being shot several times).The killer is something you do not see in modern day movies...a film with a true meaning this story is of ethics honour and redemption and thats what makes it a classic.,The Killer
946,Back to the Future Part II,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2532491/,"I recall liking this pretty well when I saw it a quarter of a century ago, but this time, watching it on the heels of watching the original Back to the Future, I was pretty disappointed.The sequel has several notable differences from the original. For one thing, it's much more sci-fi-ish. The first movie took a sci-fi principle and built around it a movie whose charm was based on human interaction. The sequel is a bit more interested in it's sci-fi elements, and a little less interested in people.But the real problem is that this movie is much less well constructed than the original. In BTTF, everything is neatly set up. Everything that happens flows logically from a previous event. But BTTF2 is much more of a mishmosh, with a rambling story and loose threads. Even the way the movie begins is antithetical to the first one. The first time around, Doc is keenly aware of the dangers of fooling with history; in this movie, he chooses to change things around.It's also also just not nearly as funny as the first one.BTTF2 picks up towards the end. The last half hour or so has Marty returning to the scenes of the original movie, and it's cute to see the way he has to change events without letting the first time traveling Marty see him. It is in fact references to the first movie that are the best part of the second. Which just proves how good the first one was, and how idea- poor the sequel is.",Back to the Future Part II
947,Mississippi Burning,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2473114/,"Two FBI agents go to Mississippi in 1964 to investigate the disappearance of three civil rights activists. Based on true events, this is an absorbing drama about one of the most explosive chapters of American history. Hackman is terrific as an agent who doesn't condone the racism, but understands the culture of hatred, having grown up in the South himself. Dafoe is equally good as a young agent who struggles to reconcile his idealistic views about justice with the reality he confronts. McDormand is also fine as the good wife of a redneck sheriff. Parker wisely uses a documentary approach to infuse the events with a sense of authenticity.",Mississippi Burning
948,Predator,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0971857/,"One of the classic sci-fi movies and one of the most entertaining action movies ever made. Certainly one of the best Arnold movies, along with Terminator 1 and 2. Mix a simple but effective story, one cool alien, well directed action scenes, Arnold kicking ass and you get an top notch action movie. Sure, there are some exaggerated macho performances, but John knows how to do it with style.So if you're a young (but not too young) movie viewer who haven't yet seen Predator, be sure to do so to get a sample of action 80's style with Arnold at his peak.Rating: 8/10",Predator
949,Evil Dead II,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1587402/,"This is one of the few horror movies I truly enjoyed, because the film offers a great combination of horror and comedy. It adds up to a very entertaining 85 minutes.There's a lot to like in this kinda-goofy movie: nice visuals; good humor to counteract the scariness and gore of a horror story; a small amount of ridiculous theology compare to what usually is offered in this genre, and some totally outrageous scenes. They include a woman's head loose and then biting a man's hand with the rest of her body running around with a chainsaw; a hand with a mind of it's own, monster-type grandma and grandpa in the cellar, chase scenes through a forest with trees coming to life and attacking people, on and on....wild, wild stuff.My main complaint is not enough lulls. There is too much action, and it's so intense it's almost too much to watch in one continuous sitting even with its fairly short length. One needs a break once in a while!There is no credibility in here, but that's okay since I think most of this is played for laughs more than horror. Bruce Campell suffers physical damage that would have killed a person many times but within seconds, he's back to normal. Campell, by the way, must have set the all-time record for making rubber-faced wild faces in a movie, more than Jim Carrey. However, this movie certainly isn't one to be scrutinized for realism. You have to look at it, with all the gory scenes and shocking violence as not much more than just tongue-in-cheek satire on horror movies. It's great fun.",N/A
950,Ferris Bueller's Day Off,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2320719/,"Let me first say that the main story here, involving the kids, contains many iconic scenes.The problem is the sub-plot about the misadventures of the school's principle (Mr Rooney) which seems to come from a different and inferior film. Its lazy slapstick brings to mind the worst parts of Police Academy or Home Alone.But the problem is deeper than that. It is philosophical.For here we have 3 affluent kids who have pampered lifestyles (particularly the insufferable Ferris), and our sympathies are supposed to lie with them. Meanwhile the butt of the joke is someone who actually has to work for a living.The cruelty with which he is subjected to humiliation while the kids swan around at others' expense is actually quite sickening. It is like seeing aristocrats gorging themselves and then being invited to laugh at their servants.It is no good saying that he is an authority figure. That would only work if the kids were of a lower standing in society as he is. If they were Chaplinesque hobos who needed to kick a cop up the behind or they were acting out of necessity, you could understand it. But they are entirely selfish.Ferris Bueller is an impossibly perfect youth, good looking, pampered by his parents, with a beautiful girlfriend and an assortment of gadgets which would have cost his adversary, principle Rooney, a year's wages back in the mid 80s. We are constantly told how popular he is in school. Why? I imagine a real life Bueller would annoy the hell out of most people.His friend Cameron has access to at least two cars, one of which is a fabulous Ferrari which his father keeps in a large garage overlooking a specular wooded area.And we are supposed to care that these, and Bueller's girl, go on a joyride? Rather like in the old Road Runner cartoons, which suppose our sympathies should lie with a one-dimensional annoying character rather than the harassed workaholic, I guess many people were hoping that Bueller would get his comeuppance in the end. Alas no such luck.",Ferris Bueller's Day Off
951,Down by Law,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0231922/,"One of the most frequently heard criticisms of Jarmusch's work is that the pace is slow. I would like to make a case for patience. After all, if true beauty and grace were delivered in one massive hit, our poor brains and hearts would not withstand the blow. In Down By Law, Jarmusch invites us to take some time, some real time and devote it to getting deeply involved with his characters. Men in crisis. Misfits, jailbirds, heartbreakingly human. We accompany them on their journey, their escape from their confines. It is a truly epic journey on a small geographical scale. We watch as they begin to mirror one another, as their individual egos become inextricably enmeshed in one another. We watch a friendship form. And how can we begrudge the time Jarmusch takes for this glorious exposition? How can we do anything but marvel at the fine detail in which the scenes are drawn, at the subtle movements of our heroes? Every gesture signifies worlds of meaning and consequence. And Jarmusch does it better, with more skill and with more compassion than anyone. If you are prepared to get involved, if you are brave enough to commit to the journey, you will be rewarded with a kind of epiphany that few films can offer.",Down By Law
952,The Goonies,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4535953/,"Astoria Oregon is famous for two things. It's the filming location for The Goonies and it was the termination of the 18th Century Lewis and Clark Expedition. This is no coincidence. Kids want to believe in exploration and empowerment.1985 was right about the time when Nintendo emerged as a new past time for kids to hold up at home staring at a screen. And if kids did go out, they were likely headed to an arcade.Know your market. Donner and Spielberg knew exactly how to tug at the heart strings of kids looking for excitement and adventure. It's an hommage to exploration and Fantasy at a time when Children were considered an emerging market for toy and film companies; hence the popularity of the film.The Goonies wouldn't work in modern times. It's not believable that kids would hop on their bikes and go on an adventure. Kids in the suburbs need mom's car to go anywhere.Throw in an amazing soundtrack and stellar editing... I show this film to my 13 year old students every year. And they love it because we all long for some outdoor adventure in this age of smartphones, social media and video games. You need to be a kid or young at heart to really get this flick.",The Goonies
953,The Color Purple,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0959161/,"Steven Spielberg is, ironically, the most unfairly underrated man in Hollywood. There are so many directors that are content to make blatantly unoriginal works but Spielberg is the most original and ethical crowd-pleaser in America. And yet he is considered one of the men who ruined cinema. People complain that his Jaws was so successful that it encouraged producers to make hackwork movies that will undoubtedly make millions (bringing Hollywood cinema to where it is today). First of all, George Lucas's Star Wars is more responsible for this. Secondly, who are we to blame Spielberg for the deeds of the producers/filmmakers who were (superficially) influenced by him? What annoys me even more than this is that so few people realize that his films keep getting better as his career goes on (with the exception of Schindler's List, Amistad, the Jurassic Park movies, and Saving Private Ryan). Jaws is probably his least impressive extremely impressive film he has made. The Color Purple, for example, which was made in the 80s, is one of his best films to date. It is so dripping with complexity and detail; it differs from Schindler's List and Saving Private Ryan in the sense that, when you watch it, you don't think, 'Oh this is a movie about the life of an African American family in the early twentieth century.' 'Themes' and 'topics' fade away and the film just becomeslife. It is about people, not historical figures. Danny Glover plays Albert, a nasty man who marries Celie (Whoopi Goldberg). He is furiously disappointed with the fact that he did not get to marry Netti (Akosua Busia), Celie's sister. As a result, he beats Celie and, as a result of that, Celie becomes painfully quiet and unable to smile without putting her hand in front of her mouth. The relationship between Celie and Albert is hard-hitting, melancholic, and funny. Neither character is treated cartoonishly and both actors play their characters with fairness and delicacy. This is not a work of easy melodrama. It makes you think about subjects such as femininity, the black population's quest for independence at the beginning of the new century, and the eruption of violence in a relationship without ever cheating or faltering a single step.",The Color Purple
954,The Color Purple,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0220006/,"A film that can make you shed tears of sadness and tears of joy would be considered quite a step in the career of a common filmmaker. The fact is, Steven Spielberg, probably our greatest story-teller, has been doing this in various movie formats for years. THE COLOR PURPLE, at the time, was considered risky, especially after action classics like JAWS and RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK. In hindsight, this film should have come as no surprise, for Spielberg had made us cry tears of joy and sadness in E.T. Critics called COLOR PURPLE his entrance into intellectual fare. It is quite an entrance. No special effects, no swashbuckling, just brilliant story-telling based on a literary classic by Alice Walker. One surprise is how Spielberg could present such a moving film about African-Americans in the deep south. Slavery is gone, but in the south depicted here, it seems as though blacks are using other blacks as slaves. Spielberg is always put down for sentimentalizing his pictures or adding an element of childishness to please the audience. This is really the first of overlooked films from his career that you cannot make these observations. It is the first in a line of films people either didn't see or wouldn't see because there are no aliens. EMPIRE OF THE SUN, ALWAYS, SCHINDLER'S LIST, etc.. His awesome talent is obvious with this specific picture because A) he uses mostly untrained, first-time actors, B) he tackles a subject most felt was unadaptable to the screen, and C) it is pure drama with no strings pulled where characters grow and change over the passage of roughly 30 years. It is almost epic-like in look and scope and the fact that it did not garner a single Academy Award from 11 nominations is a travesty and an insult.Whoopi Goldberg is fabulous as the tortured Celie, an unattractive woman given away by her incestuous father to an abusive Danny Glover, who she only knows as ""Mister"". The film follows a path of occasional beatings and mental torture she goes through while with ""Mister"". The PG-13 rated film is pretty open to the sexual issues raised by the Walker novel. This is not ""The Burning Bed"" in Georgia by any means. There is no blatant revenge taken as might be expected. It happens gracefully. Goldberg perfectly plays a human being, someone in need of love and someone who deserves it. The films' most poignant and heartbreaking moment comes when Goldberg and her sister, Nettie (played by Akosua Busia) are separated, maybe forever. (Possibly foreshadowing Holocaust separation of child and parent?) You may have to check for a pulse if you are not moved by this sequence.The color purple stands for the beauty of the fields and flowers surrounding these poor people. There really is something to live for, but love triumphs over all. Spielberg bashers take note: the guy can make an unforgettable classic without any cute aliens.RATING: 10 of 10",The Color Purple
955,The Killing Fields,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0212278/,"Based on the Khmer Rouge revolution in Cambodia, this is an excellent tale of hardship and friendship. Basically director Roland Joffe` did an wonderful job in exposing the detailed facts so simply in the film that you believe that you are in that time in person. The two actors, Sam Waterson and Haing Ngor both displayed godlike pieces of acting. It's unfortunate Waterson couldn't join Ngor in Academy Awards. In addition, the director's credit is to highlight both the characters' points of view. That's why the movie became so interesting to watch. John Malkovich brought out a fine performance as a photographer. In the course of the story of adventures of the two men, the film also has vivid descriptions of the public life during the war. Several detailed scenes of war violence are presented here so indifferently that you are bound to be convinced about its historical accuracy. Here we find the magical cinematography of Chris Menges. Again, during the time of Dith Pran's suffering, it never seemed that the director is showing too much.One of the most important, and my favorite, aspects of the film is its ending. You cannot imagine of a better alternative of this happiest ending possible in a war drama. And with the fantastic use of Lennon's ""imagine"", it has got to an enormous height of perfection. 5/5.",The Killing Fields

Forttunately we're all in for the ride. This is a bitter, dark comedy in the tradition of Pietro Germi and Mario Monicelli. In Scorsese's hands it becomes something we've never seen before. De Niro travels unknown territory with the panache of a seasoned explorer. His Rupert Pupkin is a sub Jay Leno without an agent. His hunger is as shallow as his talent. The arrival to Jerry Lewis's house without an invitation trying to impress his girl is one of the most painful studies in modern humiliation ever put on film. I found myself laughing in horror. ""The King of Comedy"" is ripe for a revival. Some people consider it a ""minor"" Scorsese. I disagree. I think it's one of Scorsese and De Niro's best.",The King of Comedy

As I was watching the film, I had this rush of nostalgia running through me, I was remembering the times when I was a kid with my family. The film didn't at all feel to childish to me, I was actually having a lot of fun, like I used to when I was a kid. This film has not aged at all since 30 years ago.

The toll the selfish Baby Boomers began to take on the American family as they grew up and had kids of their own was making itself felt.""Kramer vs. Kramer"" is one of the first of these dysfunctional family dramas that would continue to be so popular throughout the 1980s, and it's one of the best. It gets a rather bum rap now, because it's known as the film that beat ""Apocalypse Now"" for the 1979 Best Picture Academy Award, but comparing these two films is like comparing a banana to a marinated chicken breast: they're not remotely the same, but can't we enjoy them both? Director/writer Robert Benton doesn't try to do anything fancy with his movie; its strength lies in its performances, those of Dustin Hoffman and Meryl Streep particularly, playing a divorced couple fighting childishly and selfishly over their son. The courtroom scene in which they duke it out for custody, and in which each is forced to hurt the other in terrible ways, is devastating, and feels authentic. The movie doesn't present Hoffman's solid dad as a hero, or Streep's straying mom as a villain. They're neither good or bad as people -- they're simply bad at being married.The film is tear-jerky at the finale, but not in a manipulative way. It earns its right to elicit sobs.Grade: A",Kramer vs. Kramer
959,Kramer vs. Kramer,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0168493/,"""Kramer vs. Kramer"" is a terrific drama about an unhappy woman who walks out on her husband and young son. The husband now has to take up the responsibilities of taking care of the boy. As he does, they get to know each other better. But then, the mother and wife returns, and she wants custody of the boy. ""Kramer vs. Kramer"" has lots of drama with some wonderful bits of comedy thrown in for good measure. Dustin Hoffman won his first Best Actor Oscar for his brilliant performance here. Most people say his performance in ""Rainman"", which won him his second Oscar, is his best. He was great in that film, but I disagree that its his best. In my opinion, the best performance of Hoffman's career is in this movie. Scene after scene shows us why Hoffman is one of the best American actors working today. He's also funny at times. Also giving a terrific performance is Meryl Streep, who wasn't as well known when she made this film like she is today. Streep, like Hoffman, also won her first Oscar (for Best Supporting Actress) for her work in ""Kramer vs. Kramer"" as the wife and mother who tries to find herself after walking out on her family. Justin Henry, who was only 8 years old when the film came out, is wonderful as Hoffman and Streep's son. He won an Oscar nomination for his role here, and still to this day he is the youngest performer to receive an Oscar nomination in a competitive category (Best Supporting Actor). Jane Alexander is also fine as a conserned family friend. She too got an Oscar nomination (for Supporting Actress where she lost to co-star Streep). ""Kramer vs. Kramer"" is a great film from start to finish. Writer-director Robert Benton has made a film that's absolutely unforgettable. **** (out of four)",Kramer vs. Kramer

Trouble is coming, and no amount of narration or expository dialogue could sum the situation up better.

From its first opening shot to its last frame, there is such lyricism and emotion and beauty that it almost leaves you speechless. I have not seen this movie in years, but it still affects me and I want to write about it. There is a pervading sadness to the movie, like a memory of something wonderful that could have been, that should have been, that almost was, and is all the more tragic because it was in your hands but slipped through your fingers.

962,The Outlaw Josey Wales,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4223769/,"With a Magnum .44, Clint Eastwood asked how lucky you felt, as Josey Wales, he doesn't even need to pull his pistols... but you'd better whistle Dixie once he's done asking.And as usual, words are still less eloquent than the stares emerging from the shadows over his eyes or that nasty spitting habit that works like poetic punctuation marks in sentences written by the sole power of his death-pending silences. In fact, whether for tobacco juice, juicy one-liners or bullets, Eastwood sure knows how to deliver!Yet ""The Outlaw Josey Wales"" is more than a crossover of 'Dirty Harry' and the 'Dollar' Trilogy but it couldn't work if Eastwood pretended to ignore the characters who made him a star. He actually plays with his trademark with brilliant self-awareness. For instance, the way he's got the sun in his back to make him look more menacing has often been a directing technique rather than a plot element. Wales mentions it as a necessity, in order to have an edge over the enemy.Later, he rescues Grandma Sarah (Paula Trueman) and her granddaughter Laura Lee (Sondra Locke) from Comancheros. Lone Watie, his old Native companion played by the irresistible Chief Dan George can anticipate every single move,like a fan watching his favorite movie ... and when the talk is over, he warns the ladies that ""hell's coming for breakfast"". Wales can't be an artificial character because his tricks are survival keys. Someone who lost his family can't afford any deficit in anticipation anyway. And our own anticipations are always toyed with for either comedic or dramatic purposes. The initial encounter with Lone Watie is funny in a touching way because the old Indian realized a white man has been sneaking up on him, which means he's been slipping. Later, he managed to take his revenge only to be surprised by a gun-cocking hello from Little Moonlight (Geraldine Keams). Chief Dan George is a real delight of Oscar-worthy talent. With bittersweet lucidity, he embodies the resignation of someone who doesn't see himself as a Native only, but a tired old man too civilized to fit in the world, but he tries.But let's get back to the anticipation, another highlight from the movie (which is saying a lot) is the peace talk with the Comanche chief. ""You be Ten Bears?"" asks Wales. ""I am Ten Bears"" retorts the charismatic commander with perfect English, he's played by the unforgettable Will Sampson. The genius of this exchange lies on the set-up, everything seemed to ""indicate"" a coming bloodshed but a simple and straightforward man-to-man talk solves the situation. Yet if it wasn't for the ""get ready"" scene before, the ""it shall be life' wouldn't have been as emotionally satisfying, unpredictability is the film's strongest suit especially when it's played for quiet drama moments instead of action.And this is how, for all its kinship with the 'Dollar' trilogy, the film manages to reconcile the revisionist with the old-school vision and its gallery of colorful characters, bounty hunters, settlers, Natives, cavalry, bartenders, saloon girls and carpetbaggers. Even Wales, the lone wolf, gets along with his new companions. Chief Dan George and Paula Trueman can also talk about 'pale faces' and 'redskins' because there's no offense possible between them. The film shifts from the usual animosity between American and Natives to actually reveal an even worse hatred between Americans.The opening is quite savage on that level. Wales, a peaceful Missouri peasant, witnesses the killing of his wife and son by a Union militia called Redlegs and lead by Captain Terril (Bill McKinney). The grief-stricken man vows revenge and joins the Confederate counterpart lead by Fletcher (John Vernon), and their band leads no-less merciless rides... economically displayed during the opening credits sequence. The real story commences at the end of the war, Wales grew a beard, looks meaner, and refuses to surrender in exchange of amnesty.Once again, anticipation is everything and his instinct prevents him from being shot in an ambush from which young Jamie (Sam Bottoms) is the only one escapee. The Union soldiers executed their former enemies, hypocritically ignoring that war crimes were from both sides and the border states was the setting of fratricide murders... like a Civil War within the Civil War. Anyway, with a reward over his head, Wales , crosses the path of many bounty hunters who'd learn at their expenses that dying ain't such a way to make a living. And the more dead left to buzzard, the bigger the legend grows.Still, the story is less about the chase than the new perspective it has to offer on the Civil War. It wasn't just a right cause against an archaic system or the ""Battle Hymn of Republic"" against ""Dixie"", but savagery dictated by the tragic randomness of borders and the cruel calculations of politicians who, unlike people, don't live together. And the way Natives and Whites get along in the film prove that in Eastwood's Western universe, there's no place anymore for binary thinking, a stance probably inherited from the revisionist wave, Sam Peckinpah, Sergio Leone or Arthur Penn who showed the human side of Natives in ""Little Big Man"", and did so with depth and humor.In the post-Vietnam days, Westerns ironically stopped to be the exaltation of a nostalgic past but the echo of the political disillusion of a lost generation. In 1976, Western neo-classics were past their prime and Clint Eastwood was not an established director yet, but he found the right tone and the right story, as if only he could reconcile between the new and old school, make a humanistic story from material written by a KKK apologist, or a politically relevant drama out of a period film. There was no pretension or trendy thinking, he just saw the potential of the character and he was right. The film found its public and gets better after each viewing.",The Outlaw Josey Wales
963,The Outlaw Josey Wales,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1105144/,"Having grown up with Josie Wales as a household name and being a big fan of westerns, I have to agree with the just about everyones previous comments in describing it as excellent. It represents what a true western is. The story line is captivating and intense. The lead character played by Clint himself could be played by no one else. What some may call ""lack of acting"" because of lack of dialog only lends itself to the desirability of this film. You find yourself hanging on his next words. Clints one liners are still household expressions nearly thirty years after the movies release. In short this film is one of the best westerns made period. There have been others that Clint has made including the spaghetti westerns and his Oscar winning Unforgiven that add to his credibility as a great actor and film maker. But not many films touch so many levels of emotion. The only letdown to this film is that it had to end and no sequel was followed by Clint. Lastly, it's too bad for the film industry and Eastwood fans like myself that the man has to get old. His take on what entertains an audience is uncompromising. Films like The outlaw Josie Wales and what it represents to the American Culture will be enjoyed for many years to come.",The Outlaw Josey Wales
964,The Man Who Would Be King,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0142519/,"For some reason, every time they decide to show this movie on a Swedish TV channel, they do so in the middle of the night, when everyone's asleep. I'm getting angry everytime I see that: because this is a great movie that hasn't really got much recognition (maybe it's like this only here in Sweden). You shouldn't have to miss out a movie this good just because you haven't heard of it.That said, I will concentrate more on the movie. It's based on a short story by Rudyard Kipling, but this is one of the few occurances where I find the film better. It's an amazing story set in India from when it was under British rule. As the main characters we see Sean Connery and Michael Caine, and they do great roles. I'd always known Sean Connery was a great actor, but I hadn't seen Caine's potential until I saw this movie. Their characters' friendship makes this a warming movie, but at moments it's also quite sad. Besides Connery and Caine, it has many memorable characters, like Christopher Plumming as Kipling.Stan Huston directs, and I think it shows. The environments for example, really are outstanding; the icy mountains, the crowded market and the Pakistan deserts. When I had finished watching I was overwhelmed, it felt like one of the greatest stories ever told, much like the feeling I had after watching Lawrence of Arabia and Dersu Uzala. There's really nothing that goes against this movie, and needless to say I gave it 10/10.",The Man Who Would Be King
965,The Man Who Would Be King,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0142542/,"Truly, truly brilliant.  It is so rare that I see a film that I wouldn't change, and I honestly can't think of a thing.  Huston's films so often include that quintessential scene -- the one where his characters realize that they've lost everything, and respond with unbridled true character. Those who cry or bemoan the loss are beyond redemption.  But those who can laugh in the face of disaster, who can ask forgiveness for the patently unforgivable -- they are the greatest of Huston's figures, and perhaps the greatest characters of cinema.  Just as Bogart and Hepburn laugh while they lie in the bottom of a boat awaiting death, Michael Caine and Sean Connery face certain death in this film and respond with complete honesty and complete honor.  For all of their lies and arrogant ambitions, they are still a pair of b*****ds you would love to know.Which brings me to the two incredible performances.  It is nearly impossible for such recognizable actors to fade into the guise of their characters. But Caine and Connery manage it, and with perfect aplomb.  As best friends, they are perfectly inseparable, and their innate connection makes for one of the most affecting male friendships in history.  Surrounded, with no reasonable hope in the world, Danny asks Peachy to forgive him for being ""so bleeding high and so bloody mighty."" And, of course, Peachy forgives him. These are men who sing boldly in the last moments of life.  God bless John Huston.",N/A
966,The Conversation,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1038981/,"He's supposed to be the leading authority in freelance surveillance, but from the start there are hints that while he's good, he's also careless. While his apartment is locked, his landlord leaves him a Happy Birthday present. His mistress, Amy (Teri Garr in a small role) tells him she saw him standing in the staircase for an entire hour. He invites a rival co-worker to his office (which seems to be a warehouse) with several other people and carelessly allows the man to record his own conversation by means of what looks to be an innocuous pen which wouldn't be out of place in any James Bond movie. And his liaison with a call girl he meets at that party results in her stealing the tapes of a conversation he has recorded and that has lately been the focus of his obsession.This is Harry Caul, a loner who is a little too glum to be good company and takes his work seriously. Maybe too seriously -- which eventually proves to be his downfall. The fact that his own co-worker Stan (John Cazale) leaves him to go work for a rival agency, Moran, only serves to prove Harry is really someone who is so much a loner he drives anyone away from him. He can't seem to have any form of relationship -- it's only time when Amy will also leave him as she seems somewhat frustrated by this wall of privacy he's built around himself. His entire life revolves around secrecy, and he only is able to live vicariously throughout others, even if he himself feels guilty about it and would deny it because to top it all, he has a strong religious streak, and discloses under confession that he was witness of a surveillance gone wrong and which resulted in the deaths of three people. Now this assignment has him worried: he's listened to a conversation between a man and a woman and is afraid the woman's husband may try to kill them both.But is this what he's heard, or has been misinterpreted due to the limitations and distortions of sound? Like 1966's BLOW UP, which dealt with what the human eye is capable of discerning through the mechanism of a camera and what happens when one zooms in, THE CONVERSATION deals with the manipulation of sound to make out a sentence that lies just underneath the sounds of the city. But while that elusive sentence comes through -- ""he's kill us if he had the chance"" -- what Harry fails to catch is the intonation itself, which would have radically altered his deduction and completely shifted his attention. Like the definition of the word ""caul"", Harry is unable to see (or hear) the reality, or that he's been a victim of his own occupation by the end of the film; by making himself visible to whom he thinks was in danger, he's now made himself the target of surveillance by the same agency who employed him as he receives that disturbing call at the end: ""We'll be listening to you."" Whether it be real or not, one shot implies it is: a panning shot to the right, then to the left, from an elevated angle, showing us the destruction of Harry's apartment through his own hands as he has fruitlessly tries to debug his place. It's the tell-tale pan of a surveillance camera, which he has failed to discover. Again.This is most definitely not an action-packed thriller, but one that is totally cerebral -- it forces you to pay attention, to listen, to heighten your senses and discover for yourself what Harry is trying to find even when we know he will be wrong all along. Even as he seems to teeter over madness near the end as his grisly discovery of blood pouring out of a toilet bowl at the Jack Tarr Hotel indicates, we still wonder if he's actually seeing this, or not. Like BLOW UP, this is one of those mysteries that doesn't look to get solved cleanly, but by being inconclusive, lingers in the mind long after the credits have rolled, and in the process, leaves one man destroyed.",The Conversation
967,Fantastic Planet,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2559734/,"I'm not much of a fan of fantasy. A friend, however, brought this film to my attention because he said he couldn't get the story out of his head, and made further comments that piqued my curiosity.Well, it didn't kill me to see the film and I'm happy to say that it was worth my time – for a number of reasons. First, the mise-en-scene is quite imaginative with absolutely surreal environments that I think owe a lot to the imagery of Monty Python; nothing wrong in copying – everybody does it, anyway.Second, it's a fairly simple story about the oppression and exploitation of the masses in a fantastic society somewhere in the cosmos. To that extent, it's an allegory for any situation that results in a clash between opposing cultures, different societies and so on. It's given a new slant here, though, by portraying humanity – called the Oms – as the oppressed who are exploited by blue giants, known as the Traag. The plot follows the exploits of one male Om who, after learning all about the Traag, escapes from them to rouse the other Oms to mount a rebellion.Finally, however, the most intriguing aspect about this film is the clear connection between it and other sci-fi and fantasy films. For example, the discordant sounds in this film are, I think, a direct copy of those I heard in The Forbidden Planet (1957). As noted already, the whole scenario owes much to the Monty Python TV series. And for sure, I think, James Cameron copied the idea of a giant tree sanctuary from this film for inclusion in his epic Avatar (2009). Cameron, of course, reversed the oppressed-oppressor roles of humanity and the blue giants for his story.Moreover, here's a way-out thought: being a French production and seeing as how the French just love Hollywood westerns, I was amused to see the 'outlaw' Oms run for cover to a tiny hole in a wall – a long, blank, gigantic solid wall – much like how the real Butch Cassidy and his outlaws retreated to what was known as The Hole-in-the-Wall Gang hideout in the late nineteenth century. Too much of a stretch for you? Then think about why the writers here also included a Hollow Bush Gang of Oms who acted as enemies of the rebellious Oms in the Tree of Life sanctuary who wanted to escape from the Traag.Actually, I also think that The Hollow Bush Gang is a metaphor for the Gang with No Brains, as you will see – in contrast to the rebellious Oms who figured out how to escape from Traag domination. Knowledge, after all, is power and so forth...And, for something even more off the wall: long ago, Edgar Rice Burroughs (famous for Tarzan and others) wrote sci-fi stories about Mars. In one of those stories, there were headless humanoids that could function only when a head slithered into position between the shoulders. So watch for a brazen copy of that idea in this film.I guess kids today would find the graphics and imagery quite rudimentary when compared to the current technology of mind-blowing CGI action. Too bad – their loss.If you ever come across it on TV or on DVD, you could do lot worse with a couple of your hours, I guess. As a piece of cinema history, it is worth seeing; and I'm glad I did.Give it seven stars for the imagery and overall effort.January 26, 2012",N/A

Although I appreciate animations like Finding Nemo or the Incredibles for they represent a renewal of the genre (in the same way the Disney movie did in the 50's), the artistic style of La Planete Sauvage is unmistakable and accords perfectly with the dark atmosphere of the movie. This animation is based on the book Oms (a deformation of the french word homme, man) from the French SciFi writer Stephan Wul who should also be credited for being the writer of The Time Masters (another SciFi animation worth your time). Wul's real name is still a mystery. The rare things we know about his life are that he wrote his 10 (or so) only books when he was studying dentistry at the University. He apparently graduated and became too busy to continue his writing activity. What a pity. I've read most of Wul's book and they are all unique and beautiful. The animation sticks true to Wul's vision. The art by the Czech master Topor is dark and oppressing, despite the bright color of the 60-70's-influenced graphism, adding to the uncomfort of seeing human beings treated as pets or pests by giant extraterrestrials. However, the roles are interchangeable and humans do behave too often in the way the extraterrestrials do in the movie with other living creatures on Earth.

969,The Day of the Jackal,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2097562/,"Frederick Forsyth is the imaginative author behind this suspenseful and riveting tale concerning the attempt on the life of the Former President of France, Charles de Gaulle. From first to last, the director has embed this dramatic film with the believability of actual fact. Years ago, during his tenure as President of the Republic of France, De Gaulle gave Algeria its Independence. French army veterans felt betrayed by him and the government decide to assassinate him. There were several attempts, all of which were either botched or failed miserably. Thus the basis for this movie. "" The Day of the Jackal "" is the story of a secret group of retired Agerian officers called the O.A.S. who promised to kill de Gaulle, opt to hire an expert assassin to carry out the deed. That man is an Englishman, Paul Duggan, (Edward Fox) who is given the code name 'The Jackal'. He is a professional marksman with a perfect record of assassinations around the world. Aware that OAS officers want de Gaulle dead, the French police put a 24 hour surveillance on them. They capture and torture one courier who reveals the new attempt and discover the contract killer is little more than a ghost. Nevertheless, they hire the best detective in all of France, Commissioner Claude Lebel (Michael Lonsdale) to discover the identify of the killer before he kills the president. Derek Jacobi plays Caron his assistant and both men have the impossible task of finding a nearly invisible man. While the police are informed of his task, they do not know much else and therefore allow the Jackal to find a perfect location for the deed. Once in place the assassin waits for his target, who is precisely on time and only a few seconds separates the two cops from their quarry. The entire film is well paced as is the storyline. The acting is superb and contains some well known actors like Cyril Cusack as The Gunsmith, Alan Badel, Tony Britton, Adrien Cayla-Legrand as The President and Maurice Denham as General Colbert.

It is probably the prime example of how the film industry did such a better job with movies of this genre 30 and 40 years ago. I was comparing and contrasting this with the original ""The Manchurian Candidate,"" both films dealing with assassination, but taking totally different paths -- one with a brainwashed assassin, the other with a coolly professional one. But in comparing this film with more-modern films -- including the remake of this one -- it's amazing how everyone involved 30 or 40 years ago used dialog, character development, fantastic cinematography and other such tools to craft an incredibly complex and tense work.

971,Badlands,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1013656/,"Is it really possible that this luminous masterpiece is a first feature film? It is as though Mozart had started his career in composition with one of his mature symphonies. What is totally special about 'Badlands' is the visual control that Terrence Malick applies to the story, and his use of fabulous music to embed his amazing images in our mind. The 'Bonnie & Clyde'-ish story could have been turgid, but Malick turns it into a mythic journey.At the heart of Malick's method is the fabulous interior monologue by Holly explaining and ironically commenting on the story. ""Kit made me take my schoolbooks so I wouldn't fall behind with my studies..."". This has been characteristic of each of Malick's films - Linda in 'Days of Heaven' and Witt in 'The Thin Red Line' have somewhat similar monologues - and 'New World' is monumentalised by the haunting monologue/montage with which it ends. Here it totally sucks the viewer into the story and makes the montages that it accompanies into, just about, the high-point of seventies cinema. Alongside this, Malick uses some of the most haunting music in existence. Whether it is Carl Orff or Nat King Cole, Malick transports us with fabulous romantic imagery that perfectly balances it.I started on this comment determined not to use the word 'poetry', but I just can't avoid it. With nearly all filmmakers, including very great ones, the style that they present is very much prose - great prose, perhaps, but firmly rooted on the ground. With Malick, we are taken, emotionally, to the stars by the lyric magnificence of the totality of his vision.It is said that Welles learned cinema by watching John Ford's 'Stagecoach' before embarking on 'Citizen Kane'. Every young filmmaker should watch this amazing masterpiece again and again and again and inform their work with Malick's matchless sense of true cinema.",Badlands
972,Cabaret,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0121479/,"This landmark masterpiece defies strict classification. It is one of a few movies which defines cinema. It's undefinable as a genre because it works as a musical, as drama, as a comedy, as a war movie, as a social satire, as a historical epic, as a masterpiece of cinematic choreography, AND THE LIST GOES ON. Interestingly, it is over powering not only as a film, but as an original Broadway musical, a novel, a play, and most recently as a revamped musical which incorporates the new songs and choreography created especially for the film into the original show. And the Tony and other awards from other media keep pouring in. The new DVD version is a must. This is the movie that in a very tight Oscar race year (like 1939 with Gone with the Wind, etc.), won NINE Academy Awards. And that against the Godfather! (Part I, just for starters.) The late Bob Fosse did score a major coup by winning the Best Director Award over the favored legendary Director of the Godfather. Fosse's delegacy lives on...on film, and on stage right now in London, Berlin, and New York where the CABARET revival, did I mention CHICAGO?, and FOSSE, the musical- based on his life- including a piece from the movie of Cabaret continue to dazzle new generations. The DVD is a knock out too. Truly one of the best, a cliche often said. THIS CLAIM, however, IS A FACT.",Cabaret
973,Cabaret,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1292733/,"Director Bob Fosse hasn't achieved an immense degree of recognition, but his movies have a distinctive flavour. He seems to have an obsession with the world of music-hall, which is felt in other movies like ""Sweet Charity"" and ""All that Jazz"". In his other movies though, musical performances tend to steal the show almost entirely. ""Cabaret"" is an exception because it has an interesting background and storyline, and the music-hall performances are cleverly used here to illustrate and emphasize the plot. They play about the same role as the Chorus in ancient Greek play.Of course, the depiction of Cabaret's ""Kit Kat Club"" deserves attention all by itself. It is not surprising that a cabaret buff such as Bob Fosse took interest in the Weimar Republic period in Germany, when ""divine decadence "" was the name of the game. Only Bob Fosse could recreate with such consumed application the grotesque sleaze of Berlin's lowlife during the rise of Nazism, a context which served as inspiration for expressionist painters, and for Brecht's ""Threepenny Opera"". During the credits, check out a woman in the public with short hair and glasses smoking a cigarette (something quite dodgy in 1931!). It is the exact reproduction of a famous painting by Otto Dix.An outrageously grinning clown (Joel Grey) introduces every cabaret number. The girls appear in all possible contorted postures keeping deadpan faces. The Kit Kat club reminds of a roman arena, where the public is out for anything insane (even women fights in the mud...). To give an idea of what sort of den the club is, Michael York finds himself at one point standing next to a transvestite in a men's urinal...The cabaret performances get all the more provocative as the plot gets tense. The club is an essentially immoral place where anything is for sale, and it adapts shamelessly to the radical political changes coming up.Liza Minelli's character is totally at home in such surroundings. Her persona is perfectly sketched in her song ""Bye Bye Mein Herr"". She is the incarnation of the vamp, both heartless and ingenuous, the sort of lethal woman who drives men crazy and then gives them up like toys. Indeed, a very typical stereotype of the interwar period, think of Marlene Dietrich in ""the Blue Angel""...Minelli's performance onstage with garter belts and a bowler hat still looks elegantly naughty today.Though, the real nature of her character is well studied as soon as she gets offstage. While Minelli can't help being extravagant all the time, she turns out to be a fragile woman neglected by her father, and in demand of constant and renewed attention. As predicted in her song, she proves basically unable to engage in any serious relationship, despite her involvement with Michael York ( ""And though I used to care, I need the open air, you'd every cause to doubt me Mein Herr"").The script was based a story by British writer Christopher Isherwood, called ""A Goodbye to Berlin"", based on his own personal memories. He is allegedly the character played by Michael York. A serious upper class young man, he meets Liza Minelli out of blind chance, while looking for an apartment to share. She introduces him to all sorts of people, from riff-raff to aristocracy, including a gigolo, a Jewish heiress, and an ambiguous baron who dismisses them both after having ""played"" with the two of them. Michael York's sober performance looks a bit pale as opposed to histrionic Liza Minelli, but of course, that was necessary in order to stress the essential difference between those two strangers. The movie ends as they part on a railway platform, but one can guess their experience together will have changed them both, as as far as he is concerned, was a definite coming of age.One of the scenes, in the middle of the movie, is quite disturbing. At a countryside inn, a young S.A man sings a song called ""Tomorrow belongs to me"", which starts out nostalgic but gradually turns into an infectious Nazi march as the whole crowd joins him. This unexpected number seems to have embarrassed many viewers. If Nazism had presented itself as pure evil, would it have met any success? This daring scene makes evident that it was for many Germans of the time the symbol of positive values : beauty, tradition, order, pride, future. If you didn't know how things turned out, would you not have been tempted to sing along this powerful hymn to the fatherland as you watch this?

His energetic performance is by no means different from Julie Andrews as Mary Poppins. He absolutely deserved ,at least, an Oscar nomination. The movie lost some of its sharpness and suffered from some monotony after some time from reaching the factory. But besides the gorgeous production design and cool visuals, there was Wilder's charisma that helped to elevate the movie. The first half of the movie has great emotional value, and established the characters very well. Also, it feature some of the most beautiful songs of the movie. But due to the fast pacing, there was an action in the first half that felt forced, if it was necessary to serve a turning point of the story.There are many powerful and very important messages in the movie. But the greatest thing about them is not actually the messages themselves, as we witnessed them delivered in a lot of movies before, but it's how genuine these messages seem as they are delivered in this particular story. Peter Ostrum is great in his first and ,unfortunately, his last role. There are many dramatic scenes that required a very good actor and he is. Actually, I didn't feel for even a moment that this is his acting debut. Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory is a total blast from start to finish.

975,Midnight Cowboy,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2574044/,"I saw MIDNIGHT COWBOY in easter 1970 when i was 15. It was at a very quiet matinée in a very cold rural mountain holiday resort town in in Australia. I was alone as I had gone for a walk but discovered I was in time for the matinée. It was one of the great cinema experiences of my teenage life and left an impression on me that still resonates. After the screening, it was freezing and foggy outside and almost dark. I walked to a nearby park in the freezing fog, sat on a wet bench and cried and cried until the tears began to freeze too. I wiped them away and went home for dinner. Nobody the wiser except me. Recently I was the film again for the first time in 40 years. I am simply awestruck at the sense of NY 1969 that floods from the screen, the sense of the time anywhere in 1969 and the fact that the film is shattering in it's depiction of poverty and friendship in a bleak city. Recently I also went to NY and found that as fascinating for I felt NY was completely safe and totally unlike the squalor seen in their lives in the film. NY today is very pretty and epic and like a fun park. I have enduring respect and admiration for this extraordinary film. I hope you do too. The performances by Voight and Hoffman are award worthy, and Joe Buck, like Forrest Gump is the sexy flip side of the American Everyman. Directed by a Brit: John Schlesinger whose International eye for NY and the tawdry but fascinating life of USA 1969 has allowed this film to be as great as it is, only made one other great American films and that is the equally tangible and shocking Hollywood pit of 1937 called DAY OF THE LOCUST. Both films have trailers which every young film maker today should study for a perfect lesson in 'preview' creation.",MIDNIGHT COWBOY
976,Midnight Cowboy,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2021734/,"I worked the Times Square area for several years, circa 1969, as a NYC Police Officer. I can tell you that the title characters and many others in this fabulous movie were right on the money. There were very few ""normal"" folks who were regulars to Times Square at that time. Most visitors and tourists looked right through them but they were all there. Sexual perverts aka chickenhawks, Pimps, and of course the young kids coming off the buses from the heartland by the hundreds, ready to be savaged. The music, drug culture, attitudes of too many parents, and excitement of being a young, all combined to make people think they could ""make it"" in an area like TS. So very many never made it to adulthood because of the lifestyle: drugs, beatings and assaults were so common. Those who survived were damaged psychologically as well as physically. Personally, I never felt so overwhelmed in my life. While handling one case, you just knew there were dozens more happening at the same moment in time. Midnight Cowboy was just one little slice of life on 42nd Street. An excellent movie.",Midnight Cowboy
977,Wait Until Dark,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1118192/,"never have i ever seen a movie so thrilling that i have actually dreaded finishing it because i was having so much fun. there isn't a single part in the entire movie where you feel like you can take a second to look down at the bucket of popcorn and grab a handful because you know that as soon as you do you will miss something important and you wouldn't want to do that. right from the beginning with the airport scene the audience is given a sort of creepy feeling about what is going on and we cheer for the woman because she is portrayed similarly to a julia roberts in pretty woman (a prostitute trying to get away from her demanding pimp). although its clear that this person has never been the woman's friend and they will certainly never will. the entire premise of hepburn's blindness is amazing. i heard that they had to give her special contact lenses because her eyes were too intense for a blind person. isn't that mind-blowing? everything took off smoothly and the whole flight was without turbulence. although the landing was a tad jolty it left the viewer satisfied non the less. even when it seems as though hepburn's character is about to get killed she manages to get out of the situation smoothly. despite our crestfallen feelings of her surely impending doom after seeing her struggling to pick up a few household cutlery, she manages to prove not only to us but also to her husband that she can be a champion blind.",N/A
978,Wait Until Dark,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0099706/,"My title sums it all. I was very surprised at how good this film was. I found it very similar to a movie like ""Rear Window"". One other person's comments was titled ""The best Hitchcock film that Hitchcock never made"". It think that is very true. Most of the film is shot within this basement apartment unit. And the thriller is so great because of Hepburn being blind and these three bad guys freely walking into her unit and introducing themselves as her husband's friends, or police, or some neighbour. But they all forget one thing: She uses her ears like no regular person does, she doesn't need eyes. But that is where the thriller kicks in. Sometimes it is pretty painful for us to watch (us who can see) because she seems so vulnerable. Wrapping around of all this is Henry Mancini's music. He is using a technique that he also used in the film ""Night Visitor"" where there is this melody on the keyboard and after everynote there is the detuned note following it. Pretty cool effect. One thing I didn't get though, There is a scene where the room looks pretty dark and Alan Arkin still has his sun glasses on. I loved this film, 10 out of 10.",N/A
979,Guess Who's Coming to Dinner,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1285870/,"People have, over the years, accused this film of making Sidney Poitier's character so flawless beyond a reasonable doubt that there would be no other way to accept his impending marriage (in the movie) to Katharine Houghton without making it a racial issue. The thing is, most people forget -- had Poitier been just a regular guy who had a less than stellar job, and been less than beautiful, this story would have ended up in the recycling bin. Just as gay people or Hispanics today, in order to create positive stories about themselves, have to idealize their characters to a god-like level, the same thing had to be done back then. And it was also appropriate to have not one, but two confrontation scenes: one with Poitier and Roy Glenn -- father and son -- and one with Beah Richards and Spencer, more subtle but equally poignant. GUESS WHO'S COMING TO DINNER is a film that resonated back then despite its deadline plot and tidy ending because it came at the right time and needed a positive resolution. I doubt audiences back then would respond to any other. Although it would not shock me if people then would be thinking Hollywood had finally lost its edge with this one. It was a keen decision to have Kate and Spencer be the leads because in doing so they were assuring not only box-office draw -- people would be returning to watch their favorite unmarried couple bicker, lovingly, yet again -- but a strong statement. After all, these two have the biggest subtext in the entire film: they had had their own iconoclastic relationship, it was coming to a close, and one only had to see Kate's expression just to a side of Spence's shoulder as he gave his closing speech. She was sitting at the right of the screen, her eyes glistening with tears, feeling the time was close, knowing just how much they loved each other even to the end. On this element only -- the final, lingering shot of Kate and Spence embracing each other, getting ready for dinner and an uneasy future, GUESS WHO'S COMING TO DINNER is perfect.",Guess Who's Coming to Dinner
980,Bonnie and Clyde,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2271612/,"The film works as comedy, as tragedy, as entertainment, as a meditation on the place of guns and violence in American society. In the early 1930s, a car thief (Warren Beatty) and the daughter (Faye Dunaway) of his intended victim team up to become America's most feared and ruthless bank robbers.Bonnie And Clyde is a technically brilliant evocation of sleepy mid-America at the time of the 'Public Enemies,' using every kind of cinematic trick including fake snapshots, farcical interludes, dreamy soft-focus and a jazzy score. It failed to draw sizeable audiences or overwhelmingly positive reviews on its immediate release, and the studio effectively dumped it. But among its champions, it became a huge talking point: no-one had seen such glamorisation of criminals in a mainstream studio film, nor the abrupt switches of mood between comic moments and murderous brutality. Director Arthur Penn drew on the French New Wave auteurs for his visual style, and to earlier American B-films (notably Gun Crazy) that had in turn inspired them. The film looked chic, cool and ground-breaking, and eventually audiences - and awards - came its way. It remains a landmark American film.",Bonnie And Clyde
981,The Longest Day,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2483596/,"The previous comments about Canadian participation in the Normandy invasion were significant - insofar as there weren't very many. One of the five Normandy beaches was Canadian (Juno), but there is almost no mention of this in The Longest Day, and I'm sure that one would be hard pressed to find many Americans (and not a whole lot more Canadians) who know this. Unfortunately, it is movies such as this and other popular media that shape the historic knowledge of people on both sides of the border. In the near absence of Canadian content, I find it ironic that a young Canadian (Paul Anka) not only played a part in the movie as an American soldier, but also wrote the theme music. I find it also ironic that the legendary rifle used by US soldiers during WW2 and shown in this movie was designed by a Canadian as well (Garand is a French Canadian name). The cruelest irony, of course, is the fact that thousands of Canadian soldiers were maimed or lost there lives on 6 June 1944 and the days thereafter, with virtually no acknowledgement in this movie. I have always enjoyed watching this movie, but it is unfortunate that I must use my imagination to see in it the heroic and selfless wartime effort of my father's generation, in similar fashion to viewers in the US and UK.",The Longest Day
982,Jules and Jim,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3335287/,"The story of two friends, Jules and Jim. They meet in Paris before World War 1 and strike up a friendship. Jules falls in love with the enigmatic, volatile Catherine. However, Jim also has feelings for her... I really don't know why this is regarded so highly. The story is mostly quite dull, the characters are not that engaging, the ending is abrupt and there isn't much point to the whole thing. Performances are unconvincing and a tad irritating.It is quite morally progressive for 1962, and the relationships involved are quite liberal for the time, so maybe that's what all the fuss is about.",Jules and Jim
983,The Innocents,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0074485/,"They sure don't make movies like this one anymore. This is one of the few horror movies that does not have gory or graphic images in it. Instead, the spooks in this movie are presented in a subtle way....yet, the movie is quite scary. This is the type of horror movie that I like, one in which every now and then you see a frightening image or a startling scene, and that image or scene lingers in your mind.Everything about this movie is haunting. First, there's the song at the beginning: you hear a young girl's voice singing a beautiful yet somber song. Later you hear that song in several scenes in the movie.Second, there's the setting: this movie takes place in a large Victorian mansion with many rooms and passages, while only about eight people live in it....what could be more eerie than that?Then there's the exceptional cinematography. The black-and-white photography is perfect for this movie. This movie would not have been too creepy if it had been done in color. Further, many of the shots were innovative and the lighting was used ingeniously in some of the scenes.Additionally, I liked the way that the director chose to play around with the sound, which brought more of an element of mystery to the movie. In one particular scene, there was a lot of noise initially....and in a split second there was dead silence....then several seconds later, it was noisy all over again (all in the same scene).But what I think is the most interesting thing about this movie is the fantastic performance by Deborah Kerr. It's fascinating to watch her facial expressions in this movie. She demonstrates her character's fear quite well.I also think that the actor who plays Quint is very scary-looking! He has a very sinister look, and it adds to the spookiness of this movie. If you really want to be spooked by this movie, watch it late at night with all of the lights off....dare to watch it by yourself.",The Innocents
984,Breathless,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0069958/,"I finally did it. I finished watching À bout de souffle. I kept putting it off because I usually have problem when everybody tells me that such and such film is the epitome of its era or it breaks all the rules, starts the revolution, and reinvents the cinema. That's why, probably, I cannot like Citizen Kane - try to watch the arguably best film ever made - you will be under a lot of pressure. Well, À bout de souffle does not put you under the pressure, it takes you for a ride, and you follow for 90 minutes its incredibly young characters, common crook (Jean-Paul Belmondo) and his American free-spirited girlfriend (Jean Seberg) on their journey on the streets of 1960-th Paris along with Raoul Coutard's legendary camera. I am not going to tell here how great the camera work was, how fantastic the music score and the views of Paris were - the fans of the film know that already. They also know about the beginning of French New Wave, and how it influenced the future cinema. I just want to say that the movie was made over forty years ago - the smoking was cool back then, and Belmondo made smoking look very sexy. Belmondo fascinates me in this film. I've seen him in a lot of later movies - he's always been good (I recommend Le Magnifique, 1973 and Le Professionnel,1981 ) - but in À bout de souffle he is not just good - he is embodiment of cool, his face changes its expression every moment, you can not take your eyes off him. Is it me or he does remind the very young Mick Jagger - not commonly handsome but irresistible and sexy? He and young (she was 21 at the time) Jean Seaborg made one of the best screen couples ever. My favorite scenes: Michel drives the stolen car in the beginning of the film, and he starts to talk to us, the audience. The day is nice, the sun is shining, and the life is beautiful... Michel and Patricia drive in the convertible. The wind plays with her short hair. We only see the back of her head and her neck. Michel tells her that he loves the girl with a beautiful neck, wrists, knees, but she is a chicken... Patricia comes to the hotel to find Michel in her bed. They start talking about nothing and about very serious things. They smoke, she tries to find a good place for her new poster, and he wants to sleep with her. In the end of the scene, his face, he looks at her - there is love in that look...

985,Key Largo,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0038269/,"Key Largo is an absolutely brilliant film. Cast and screenplay are both superb. Bogart and Bacall have an intense personal chemistry that sparks on screen, and the supporting cast of Barrymore and E. G. Robinson give their best performances ever. Robinson, in particular, as the slimy gangster johnny rocco is great - his portrayal of the 'banality of evil' is the best I've ever seen.The screenplay is magnificent. Not just the dialog, but also the balance of characters is perfect. For each good character there is a bad one of equal weight, forming a perfectly complementary totality, a yin/yang balance that teeters between triumph and disaster according to the finest shades of personal choice. It's an examination of freedom, of corruption, of courage and betrayal - a perfect encapsulation of the world, focused upon a hotel on a tiny island in the middle of a hurricane.This movie deserves more recognition than it gets. The action is understated but intense, densely-packed with meaning and significance, at both the individual and cultural level. Watch this movie with new eyes!",Key Largo

988,Shadow of a Doubt,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2362352/,"In one of his most chilling and memorable intrigues Alfred Hitchcock lays bare the myth of small town virtue with a perverse piece of Americana about a wholesome family unaware of the gruesome skeleton lurking in its closet. The arrival of everyone's much loved Uncle Charlie (Joseph Cotton, in his favorite role) is the catalyst to disaster, with eldest daughter Charlie in particular welcoming the arrival of her affectionate namesake as a relief from the humdrum routine of suburban life. But evidence soon begins to suggest the elder Charles might actually be a cold-blooded serial killer, and a lethal game of charades begins between uncle and niece: she knows the truth, and he knows that she knows the truth. The tension builds to an alarming climax, in a trademark sequence (another one for the Hitchcock highlight reel) showing the Master of Suspense at the top of his form. The film was shot in sunny Santa Rosa, California, where the shadows are darker because the sunlight is so much brighter.",Shadow of a Doubt
989,Stagecoach,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0020616/,"I grew up watching the old, crotchety, gruff John Wayne, the iconic hero of the right wing, and even though I'd seen some of his early films on television, I'd forgotten what a sexy and compelling presence he had when a young man. It's easy to see while watching his performance how this film made him a star. As great as Wayne is in this film, he doesn't overshadow any of his fellow performers. Thomas Mitchell plays the drunken doctor thrown out of town, a performance that earned him an Academy Award. Andy Devine is hilarious as the complaining, squeaky voiced stagecoach driver. John Carradine is sleek and snake-like as the gambler. Claire Trevor gives a heartbreaking turn as the good-hearted whore thrown out of town by pious hypocrites. Donald Meek plays his name, a meek whiskey salesman befriended by the whiskey-loving Doc. Each actor quickly and deftly sketches his character so vividly that every performance is memorable.But the real star of the show is John Ford, the director. To introduce and define nine characters in the context of a fast-paced western is no easy task, and he accomplishes it in masterly fashion. Much of the action takes place in the limited confines of a stagecoach, but Ford takes advantage of the limits by staging brilliant and subtle bits between characters; John Wayne casts sultry glances at Clare Trevor, who blossoms under his glance, the young calvary wife's eyes glaze over as the banker pontificates, and Doc sneaks sips of whiskey from the samples case while he solicitously keeps the wind from chilling the whiskey salesman. When the action moves outside, he films the action in dynamic angles and stunts that were the most daring of its time.If you enjoy westerns and haven't seen this, you have a great night of film-watching ahead of you. And if the last time you saw Stagecoach was some midnight years ago when you wandered home for a bit of the late show before bedtime, watch it again and rediscover what a great western it is",Stagecoach
990,Bringing Up Baby,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2934579/,"I am a movie buff. So to say that this is my #1 favorite movie comedy of all time is saying something. But I don't think any movie critic could ever argue against putting this film - at the very least - in the Top 10 very best comedies ever made. Nor is there a comedy, I believe, that has a greater chemistry than exists between the main characters (including the delightful contributions by character actors May Robson, Charlie Ruggles and Barry Fitzgerald). You might then wonder why I'm going to confess I would not put it amongst the Top 10 ROMANTIC comedies. It is, at least on the surface, a romantic comedy. But the romantic side of this doesn't work quite as well as the comedy - for my money. Yet, that being said, I'd still argue it should be listed in the Top 50 top romantic comedies ever (which is still saying something). This is not to take away from the film but to say that romance really isn't a strong component of this film - nor was it (I believe) meant to be. It's just a framework upon which to create a comic work of genius. (I'm not sure many would say Hepburn and Grant had a lot of romantic chemistry here. In other words, unlike When Harry Met Sally or The Shop Around The Corner, the resulting romance at the end of this film doesn't warm your heart quite as much; it's not as convincing or moving as other romantic comedies on a romantic level.) But that's a trifle. To fault it for that is just quibbling. Because here you have two of the greatest actors ever - Cary Grant and Katharine Hepburn - at their very funniest. You have a screenplay by Dudley Nichols and Hagar Wilde that crackles with wit and hilarity. You have a pace that's like a roller coaster and laughs that will have you on the floor at times. No male actor was better at comedy than Cary Grant and here he sets the standard for how to do it. No actor can best his performance here, nor have they come close - in my humble opinion. (Grant, of course, put in incredible comic performances earlier in The Awful Truth and later on in Arsenic And Old Lace and other movies; yet I still think he laid the law down especially in this movie. This is how you do it.) Katharine Hepburn - who was as good a comic actress as serious - was absolutely inspired in this film and was never better. Was there a better female acting performance in a comedy before this movie - funnier, more convincing, with more energy and sophistication? I'd argue not (although Claudette Colbert was brilliant in It Happened One Night and Irene Dunne was stellar in The Awful Truth, etc., etc.). And you'd be hard-pressed to find a better female comedic performance in a movie afterward - although TV's Lucille Ball and Carol Burnett would later raise the bar even higher, on the tube. But I wouldn't be surprised if they learned some lessons from Hepburn here. This is just a joy ride of genius that - like all great movies - is worth seeing again and again. With its sophisticated side and its more vaudeville-inspired physical humor, this fires on every cylinder and delights over and over again.",The Philadelphia Story

Make a movie with silly sight gags, a barrage of one-liners and all-around craziness in the 1990's, and the film is labelled as a pathetic comedy.  Yet that is all you find in ""Duck Soup"", and it is regarded as one of the classic comedies all of time.

This is one of the best gangster movies of the 1930's. Very well written and full of terrific characters. Fast paced and free flowing story line. My favorite scene is when the Muni character first gets his hands on a machine gun. This arrogant, violence driven mobster becomes child like with a brand new toy. Others in this fine crime drama are Osgood Perkins, George Raft, Ann Dvorak, Boris Karloff and C. Henry Gordon.

994,Scarface,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1333370/,"Inevitably, Scarface will be compared with the near-contemporary gangster films, Little Caesar and Public Enemy, and Paul Muni with their stars Edward G. Robinson and James Cagney. What does it tell us about that era: that all three careers took off with portrayals of gang leaders? The three performances significantly differ. Robinson rises to the top by the use of a crafty intelligence as well as violence; Cagney by a type of shrewdness and personal charisma. Paul Muni's Tony Comonte is neither intelligent nor personable; his manners are crude; and at times he is almost childlike in his behavior: for instance, when he is enjoying a play and is interrupted after the second act, summoned to do another killing,and leaves a henchman behind, who can tell him later how it came out, then is delighted to hear that the ""guy with the collar"" didn't get the girl; rather, the rougher suitor. He can be described as cunning and animistic: a young wolf who eliminates any rival who stands in his way; finally the leader of the pack One can be moved by Robinson's last words, ""Is this the end of Little Caesar?"" or by Cagney's body falling through the open door of his family home, he having been killed off-screen. Comonte's death is that of a trapped or cornered animal, wordless in a beautifully staged sequence,as brutal as his life, depicted for the audience in every detail. Of the three portrayals, Muni's comes across to me as the most chilling, in its enactment of instinctive evil. How ironic that He would later win his greatest fame for his performances as Emile Zola and Louis Pasteur.",N/A

So if any of you feel that you do not care to subject your nerves to such a strain, now's your chance to – uh, well, we warned you"". -Edward Van Sloan.Although this movie does not shock or thrill, it fascinates. The movie's cast is well worth repeating, Colin Clive, Boris Karloff, Mae Clarke, Edward Van Sloan, ETC. The movie contains obvious hints to German Expressionism, as the production team was inspired by films like Nosferatu, or The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari. The Gothic style fits the setting and the sets work beautifully. This movie would forever solidify Frankenstein in media and launched Boris Karloff into stardom. Although there is no musical score,it still works well without it as the horrifying scenes are much more emphasized than if it had music. All in all, this is a movie everyone should see, if you haven't seen it, go ahead and view this masterpiece. If you have seen it, now is the time for you to watch it again.

997,God's Own Country,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3645525/,"Saw this at the Berlinale 2017, where it was part of the Panorama section. It all happens within an unusual yet very nice setting of a farm miles from anywhere, showing how a romance develops between young farmer Johnny and a Romanian temporary farm hand. I grew up on a farm myself, and thus welcome seeing people on screen who know how to handle animals, together with demonstrating that farming is not so romantic as many think, but in fact is a 24/7 job under often unaccommodating circumstances, like cattle diseases, uncertain weather and a resisting soil.The dramatic developments are nicely spread over time. I was happy to see that the story was less predictable than one assumes after having read the synopsis. Unlike in other movies, this time it is not the village people that cause trouble by frowning on gay relationships. Even Johnny's father and grandma don't make a fuss when finding out what is happening between Johnny and Gheorghe. I like these deviations from the usual downtrodden path, and I applaud that this movie introduces new elements. It allows us to follow the interesting route that this relationship takes, in any case not straight from A to B (I use the word ""straight"" here with hesitation, no pun intended).An important plot element is that Johnny cannot cope with all the work before him, next to his ailing father who wants things done the way he always did in past years, issuing commands and criticism to that effect, without even considering to drop some parts of the farm or using new techniques that may help alleviate the workload. It is remarkable that Johnny does not stand up against the status quo. Even when halfway the running time the father falls victim to a second stroke, one that does not bode well for his complete recovery, Johnny insists that he ""will manage"" despite demonstrating that he cannot.An external trigger event is definitely needed in making very apparent that there is more work than there is time. His father's stroke in combination with Gheorghe's decision to leave due to anticipating problems in his relationship with Johnny, forces a breakthrough. Johnny tells his father that he leaves the farm for a short while (to meet Gheorghe, and to convince him to return), and that he has plans how the farm should be run after his return. He insists that several things must change to start doing things his way, and that he cannot continue at all cost how his father did it in the past.All the above combined takes care that there are ample developments to keep us awake all the running time. The characters are interesting enough and not made from cardboard, and the turns of events are not caused by the usual interference from the villagers when gay relationships are involved, but come directly from unlucky circumstances and doubtful decisions by the main protagonists.All in all, next to downplaying the overly popular romantic view on running a farm, this movie also does a good job of introducing a fresh take on gay relationships. Sex is not the main binding element here, nor is resistance from the environment an issue driving them apart. Though not essential for the plot, sightseeing through the landscapes of Yorkshire works as icing on the cake. A minor problem that I have with the plot is that Johnny continues too long on his father's leash, and is very late with allowing extra help or forcing some other way out of the work overload. Even after his father's second stroke, when it becomes abundantly clear that he cannot cope, he still insists that he ""will manage"". I missed the reasons behind the overdue switch to his new attitude that ""things have to change here"". Maybe a nitpick on a well-made movie, that has a lot of other things to offer, making it a worthwhile watch anyway.",God's Own Country
998,God's Own Country,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4073025/,"What a wonderful and unusual experience, to see a film without knowing anything about it. Before I knew it I was in Yorkshire. The silence was deafening, emotions unspoken. Then, Josh O'Connor - a miraculous actor - I didn't know who the actor was and that helped enormously to get sucked into his world - exterior and interior - and to live his experience fully. Alec Secareanu produces the perfect emotional blow. Roughness and tenderness in a stunning, totally believable performance that, I know will live in my mind forever. They changed me somehow. I was forced to look at something in a different way, without preconceptions.

What a let down. Right from the start something seemed off with both the script and acting, it seemed as though the jokes were... missing. I assumed it was a movie that got better the more you watched and they were saving the better laughs for the second half. But no, hardly any memorable jokes, just lots and lots of CG action scenes which seemed boring. I found myself bored and yawning at the thin plot and shallow characters. The X-Force seemed promising but that didn't last long.

Stars Jeremy Renner and Elizabeth Olsen as the FBI agent. Viewed at Cannes, 2017, where it won the Best director award in the Un Certain Regard sector.Rape and murder on the reservation with Jeremy Renner really coming into his own as a not particularly handsome leading man. Very strong as the predator hunter with high powered rifle on high speed snowmobile. The picture opens with a long sequence of a woman running barefoot across a vast nighttime snowscape until she finally drops dead. Eventually we will find out that she was brutally gang raped and was fleeing for her life. Reservation great white hunter, Renner, starts an informal investigation on his own. An FBI agent, (Olsen) is called in to assist with the investigation. A junior woman agent is all the FBI cares to spare for this case, obviously regarded as unimportant because who. cares about Indians! But, since only the FBI has police authority on Indian reservation territory they have to make at least a token contribution to the investigationAt the end of this snowy subzero nail biter, Renner having tracked down the main rapist subjects the now wounded and fleeing central SOB to a most satisfying form of vigilante justice -- making him crawl on his belly bloodied and barefoot in the snow to a hideous painfully slow death -- the same kind of death the multiple rape victim at the beginning had to endure. The fetching female FBI agent called in on the case (Elizabeth Olsen) provides a slightly romantic angle to an otherwise edgy all male Indian reservation thriller. Beautiful snowy mountain photography throughout is more than noteworthy. Overall one of the best films of the Cannes week.Kudos to director Taylor Sheridan and all others involved in this remarkable outdoor production. This Weinstein brothers prod was filmed in Utah although the setting is supposedly Wyoming on the Wind River Reservation. An added reality perk, real Indians, not Hollywood palefaces, portray the Native American characters. And do it so well!The Wind River Indian Reservation is an Indian reservation for the Eastern Shoshone and Northern Arapaho tribes of Native Americans in the central western portion of the U.S. state of Wyoming. The entrance to the Wind River Reservation is the small town of Lander, Wyo. which is actually seen in one brief scene, but the magnificent mountain snowscapes we see are all in Utah.

1002,Get Out,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3706457/,"Let's clear the air about this film. It's not a horror film. It's not a comedy. What it is, is a suspenseful thriller of the highest level, worthy to be compared to Hitchcock caliber. The humor is there, along with a few horror scenes, but not enough to overshadow the main theme of the story. The film hits all cylinders with almost no misfires. As far as complaints that the film is racist, it is not. It would work just as well with an all-black or all-white cast. Those complaints are from people who are uncomfortable with black people or interracial relationships and are letting it distract them from the narrative of the film.

The movie leaves out a lot of crucial scenes that explain why the main character behaves the way he does. The script is also plagued with a problem that is common in Swedish movies. The fact that the dialogue becomes too theatrical and not ringing true.Generally I felt that the acting was sub par. This is somewhat related to the problem with the dialogue; you feel like you're watching actors rather than characters. However, Bahar Pars, Ida Engvoll and Rolf Lassgård were the exceptions. They all did a pretty good job in my opinion. However, although I felt the movie lacking in a lot of areas, the story is pretty good.

This is an absolute masterpiece. The directing of the movie is also great. It's easy to understand who is who and when a flashback occurs even if you have not read the book.

The jokes where brilliant and more importantly, they were frequent and consistently brilliant. I loved the interaction of the main characters with each other and the supporting characters.Each of the main vampires had their moments and were all equally funny. The movie even had werewolves and they were also hilarious. I was also surprised by the special effects which were really well done.At one point it did feel like the jokes were getting old, but just as I had finished that thought, the movie changes and ends brilliantly. Even though there isn't much of a story, it doesn't really matter for this movie. Just watching some of the hilarious chaos that ensues in their everyday life is enough.There are not many movies that make me actually laugh out loud, but this one did on several occasions (usually comedies, even great ones, just keep me grinning through out).

1008,When Marnie Was There,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3246296/,"I'll just start by recounting the things I appreciate and think this movie did well: The main character Anna's unreality blending with reality. An abandoned mansion across a lake in a quiet village. The tides that open and close a path. Pencil sketches. The decay of a mansion. Illusions from a past. A dance with the flower girl. A haunted silo on a hill. Plenty of sentimental strings. Excessive use of windy field recordings (why else would you watch anime). Self- loathing introvert Anna. Dreamy rich secluded girl Marnie. An old taciturn fisherman. A nighttime picnic with juice and cookies. A classy suits-and-dresses party. ""Fine on the Outside"". Anna passing out in ditches (I'm stretching it now). The whole movie is visually pleasing. I always welcome peaceful depictions of a countryside. I loved that the mystery of the mansion and who Marnie was, lasted long. Patient storytelling is a huge plus. Unfortunately I disliked some things too. Mostly the ending. Anna's self-hatred is neglected by the end. Her character arc doesn't make a lot of sense. She just transforms into this new happy girl, or at least I was left with that impression, which is just the same. It really felt like a gimmick when they faded away the background noise right as the super obvious plot twist was revealed. It's like they're telling us ""you're supposed to be awe-struck now!"". It's effective when you don't see it coming, I guess. But I had figured that Anna already made that connection when she listened to Hisako's completely revealing story. Perhaps she didn't know she was in a movie where nothing can be a coincidence. In the end, the writers mess up a good socially anxious character by embracing, excuse my cynicism, typical family-movie-level optimism. It carefully maneuvers around realer, darker matters (like that of what seems to be her escapist delusions) by stuffing the viewer's throat full of parental love and finding happiness and friendship. All timeless clichés, but so uncalled for here, given the mysterious setting and mature tone of the first three fourths of the movie. Why remain on the surface when there are deeper waters waiting to be explored?You see it's hard for me to find virtue in Marnie and Anna's relationship now that I know the outcome and know who Marnie is. Especially when I know who Marnie is. Tell no one this, but I had my fingers crossed for their relationship to blossom (Ghibli doing yuri would be a sight to behold). Or at least for something more daring and mature to happen. I learned afterwards that this is indeed based on a British children's novel from the 60s, so that explains a lot I guess. Ech. How naive I was to think this was an original and recent creation. Oh well. At least finding solace in illusions is still a beautiful sentiment.",N/A
1009,When Marnie Was There,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3073602/,"Following Miyazaki's retirement, the pressure was heavy on Director Yonebayashi as the next successor of Ghibli Studio. But in the Japanese multimedia, it was stated by the Former Director Miyazaki and Producer Suzuki that the future successor was finally decided after watching Yonebayashi's first solo directed movie ""When Marnie Was There (2014)"". Was this really the case? My answer - Yes.This movie is unique in a sense that the story revolves around two female protagonists ""Anna"" and ""Marnie""; although it does remind us a hint of the nostalgic movie ""My Neighbour Totoro"" which starred ""Satsuki"" and ""May"", their relationship is far more complex. As the story progresses, their relationship becomes more clear and vivid to the audience, and the confusion of the intertwining reality and the dreamlike world starts to unfold. The two girls go on a journey as they discover each others past and dwells upon their current problems, and gradually develops an unbreakable bond that unites them stronger.Although the trailer did cause some confusing misunderstandings between the two girls in Japan, and at the same time my expectations lowered; after watching the movie it was no doubt a splendid and flawless piece of art both literally and figuratively.It is worth noting that Yonebayashi truly challenged the impossible, as even Miyazaki had once thought of making this novel into a movie but had backed down due to its continuous complex changes that occur in the world of the two girls. Furthermore, Yonebayashi has created his ""own"" depiction of the sky in this movie, and is no longer the ""blue sky"" and ""white clouds"" that Miyazaki has portrayed in his series of work. So we can expect to see his own unique world of Ghibli gradually bloom in the next upcoming years.To summarize the experience, it was astonishing how we, the audience ourselves can go on a journey together with the protagonists to overcome their obstacles. Paying attention to the changes in Anna's facial expressions is extremely crucial if you want to enjoy this movie. The succinct yet complex portrayal of these two girls really make you think of the depths of friendship.To conclude, I would like to end with Suzuki's logo that he had written for the advertising poster. The message of the logo is so sincere that to me there is no better way of epitomizing the message that the author and the director was trying to convey to the audience - 「あなたのことが大好き」- ""I love you""; an unconditional love.",When Marnie Was There
1010,The Theory of Everything,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3132541/,"This movie completely misses the mark. The world is interested in Stephen Hawking for his scientific contributions to the world. The fact he has a horrible illness is incidental. This movie drags the viewer through the weeds of Hawking's pain and suffering and never let's up until the final minutes of the movie. It was exhausting to watch and leaves the viewer with no real answers to the questions they came to better understand, explore and enjoy. For example, questions like these never get addressed what exactly are Hawking's contributions? How have they shaped thinking and helped develop a better understanding of the universe? Why was Hawking's PhD thought to be so magnificent and why did Hawking later seek to disprove his original theory? Did he disprove the original theory? How has Hawking been able to live so long despite a two year prognosis given in 1963? What lead Hawking to consider the existence of god?Hawking is played by Eddie Redmayne who does a fabulous job making you feel as though you are watching Hawking himself.This movie is about a man with a horrible illness who happens to be a magnificent scientist.

1011,The Theory of Everything,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3131118/,"We are all familiar with the story and with Steven Hawking. His groundbreaking work 'A brief History of Time' and devastating disabilities propelled him irrevocably into the public consciousness and immortal fame.But few of us could understand the complexities of his personal life and the shocking divorce in 1990 from his long sacrificing wife of more than 25 years. Indeed that episode served to darken his reputation in the minds of many, including myself, who felt ill at ease with anyone who could leave a partner who had done so much for him just at the long awaited moment when international fame and recognition finally arrived.This wonderful production, so well scripted and paced throughout, serves to explain that vital anomaly in Hawking's life. And it is made all the more poignant as it is based upon the account written by his wife who has borne so much.But it is the breathtaking performance of Eddie Redmayne as Hawking that simply blasted this film into an extraordinary level. It is difficult enough to mimic so famous a person as Hawking and it is even more difficult to portray so accurately the debilitating and gradually increasing effects of Motor Neuron Disease. But to transmit so clearly the profound emotions and inner suffering that Hawking must have experienced in his agonizing journey was a performance that left me quite speechless and at times in uncontrollable tears.It would be a travesty of the industry if Eddie Redmayne is not nominated for an Oscar after this performance.

1013,The Fault in Our Stars,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3029778/,"It is nearly impossible to make a film about terminal illness and not make it heartfelt. The Fault in Our Stars has its heart in the right place but – WOW! – you walk out wishing that someone would shake the dust and clutter and broken fragments off the screenplay so it can flow with more efficiency. Here is a movie that is so busy being profound that the characters feel trapped by plot gimmicks and stale dialogue.Based on the bestselling book by John Greene, the movie stars the talented Shailene Woodly as Hazel Grace Lancaster, a teenager with Stage 4 thyroid cancer with metastasis forming in her lungs. She's been living with this disease since she was 13, and now she lugs around an oxygen tank with a nasal cannula. Hazel is distant, a bit surly and more than a little bit cynical about the world. In other words, she's a normal teenager. Her parents force her to attend a cancer survivor support group that is led by an overly emotional group leader who begins each session by unrolling a large rug with a big – and somewhat unnerving – picture of Jesus on it.One day in group she meets Augustus Waters (Ansel Elgort), a fellow teen who confidently announces that he is suffering from osteosarcoma which has already claimed the lower part of his right leg. He's a nice guy that Hazel meet-cutes when she bumps into him in the hallway. There is little resistance from either side as to how they feel about one another and in the blink of an eye, they fall in love.That's more or less all that you need to know. The connection between Hazel and Augustus is not really built on chemistry but on the fact that they both suffer from terminal illness. The movie doesn't have the flow of real life, but is built on conventions of the plot. Everything in their relationship is calculated for effect, we get gimmicks instead of narrative. For example, Augustus carries around a pack of cigarettes and occasionally puts one in his mouth. Hazel is disgusted but Augustus offers this explanation: ""They don't kill you unless you light them. And I've never lit one. It's a metaphor, see: You put the killing thing right between your teeth, but you don't give it the power to do its killing. A metaphor."" That's fine, but the sight of Augustus with the cigarette in his mouth looks as ridiculous as it sounds. He puts the unlit cigarette in his mouth so often that we want to take his away from him and say ""STOP THAT!!"" The movie is loaded with strange moments like that. There is an odd subplot about a book that Hazel has read over and over by a mysterious author named Peter Van Haughton who has apparently disappeared into seclusion somewhere in Amsterdam. After a long and pointless series of arguments with doctors and with Hazel's parent, she and Augustus accept an invitation to fly to Amsterdam to meet him. Van Haughton is played in an angry performance by Willem DeFoe that seems shoe-horned in as if he were visiting from a different movie.Worse is what comes next. Hazel and Augustus visit Anne Frank's house. Naturally, Hazel has trouble climbing the series of steep staircases. When she reaches the famous attic, there is little to no attention paid to the fact that they are in Anne Frank's famous hiding place. Instead, the scene climaxes with Hazel and Augustus's first kiss, to which all the strangers around them begin to applaud.The movie never really deals with the issue of what it is like to live with cancer, or the inevitability that it will claim your life. The dialogue lightly dances around these issues but no one ever gets serious about discussing them. They know they're going to die but neither Augustus nor Hazel ever get down to the serious business of discussing what lies on the other side. Augustus talks a lot about ""oblivion"", which indicates that he is an atheist, but the movie doesn't go there. We know from the beginning that one or both characters will face the final curtain before the movie is over, but the film's final act is a long – very long – series of slow passages about eulogies and final wishes that goes on and on and on. It should be moving us to tears but you find yourself checking your watch instead.Hazel informs us in the beginning that ""Pain deserves to be felt."" We agree, but the movie could do with a lot more pain and a lot less catharsis. The characters talk and talk and talk and talk, but nothing they have to say has any real meaning. Death is the inevitability of this story, but there's such a long and drawn-out funerary tone to the film's third act that is tinged with so much hope and finality that it feels like the happiest sad ending you've ever seen.",The Fault in Our Stars

1015,Me and Earl and the Dying Girl,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3632768/,"If I had to pick a single genre of Hollywood movies to save from a global catastrophe, I'd go with the coming of age films. Because it's probably the only type of films in which it's not just about business and grossing revenues. Such movies are also a way to establish a communication between generations, to talk to our youth and both teach them something and explain that the world around isn't as cold and ugly as they might think. Not every film succeeds at that cultural mission, but at least most sincerely try. Which, in the modern world where kids are especially estranged from their parents, is a big deal indeed.Me and Earl and the Dying Girl is another step forward in this intergenerational dialogue. But, unlike some parents who honestly believe that since they are not young themselves then their kids' issues are nothing but some laughable nonsense, this film never ridicules its heroes.Nor does it oversweeten things. MaEatDG might sound similar to The Fault In Our Stars because it revolves around the topic of cancer, but, besides that, those films have nothing in common. And it's a good thing, because the last thing TFiOS had was sincerity. Instead, that movie glamorized cancer and that feeling of being terminally ill as if it's some sexy little perk that only makes you more appealing or interesting. However, death is definitely no fun, and fighting death might be an even less of it, which is the dark part of the picture MaEatDG didn't shy away from showing. Showing without making things pretty or convenient, and showing without intentionally making them too ugly to squeeze yet another tear of forcibly induced sympathy. Nah, unlike John Green, Jesse Andrews, on whose novel this film is based upon, decided to use more delicate colors and emotional intonations to make the story of Greg and Rachel both believable and relatable.One needs a big talent to make a gripping story about the things that happen to people routinely. And let's be sincere: just like becoming an adult, death is something most of us have a first-hand knowledge about. So I'm genuinely amazed how Alfonso Gomez-Rejon managed to pull off a movie so deep and touching about the issues so familiar and maybe even banal: finding your true self, establishing a real cost of friendship, learning to love others and yourself, fighting for personal liberty of creativity and choice. When we grow older, we tend to lose those memories of the time when we were still in the making as humans. And if this film manages to remind someone on the older side how it is to be that ball of clay, still unsure which shape to take, and maybe show someone on the younger side that the life is beautiful enough to find courage to explore it, then Hollywood hasn't been completely in vain.",Me and Earl and the Dying Girl

1018,Blue Is the Warmest Colour,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2942433/,"To put it in as simple terms as possible, Blue Is The Warmest Colour is a story about Adèle, a high school student who finds herself confused and troubled with her sexual identity. After passing a blue-haired girl on the street who catches her eye and an even more confusing, spontaneous and upsetting encounter with a classmate she finds it all to curious and enticing when a close, male friend takes her to a gay bar, she follows some girls to another bar nearby where she sees the blue- haired girl again. A short conversation sparks a relationship that carries us through the rest of the film.Well, where to start?To start with, this film is exhaustingly long. 3 hours is too much for so much useless, meandering exposition. It serves nothing other than to keep us away from a plot that is so thin you could go make yourself a cup of tea and come back 20 minutes later and nothing would've happened to push the story along. I'm sure there is an excellent 90 minute film in there somewhere if the editors had been more ruthless in their cutting and the director wasn't so preposterously self indulgent.The sex scenes are unavoidable, exploitative and sickening within the context of the films creation. The major sex scene that everyone talks about took a gruelling 10 days to shoot and was only the actors 2nd shot on-set together, they literally didn't know each other and were suddenly put together to perform these scenes for an imposing, frustrated director.Léa Seydoux and Adèle Exarchopoulos have both stated that the 3 hour film doesn't really show how much they shot, that the director would do hundreds of takes of even the most simple scenes, extend scenes and shoot for extremely long periods of time and would become enraged if they laughed even once out of one hundred takes.Knowing how the actors felt about it (thankfully they have been vocal in interviews about how horrible and unpleasant the experience was) how uncomfortable they were with unchoreographed sex scenes; sex scenes are almost always choreographed, shots and various angles kept to minimal length so that actors are more comfortable and that the experience is as desexualised as possible. They have spoken about how they felt powerless to say anything about it because ""The director has all the power. When you're an actor on a film in France and you sign the contract, you have to give yourself, and in a way you're trapped.""""In America, we'd all be in jail."" – Léa SeydouxThis is perversion and abuse of power in the truest sense. The fact that Kechiche wrote the adaptation, produced and directed the film, apparently even financed some of it himself tells me all I need to know about his intentions.

1019,Kai Po Che,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2757468/,"Kai Po Che, thus gives Bollywood a new wave of actors. Sushanth is a charmer. Amit Sadh is elegant and genuine. Yadav is creepy but portrays his role fantastically. The supporting cast is bold with Manav Kaul getting my uninterrupted attention. The music goes haywire sometimes, but the direction compensates it. Cinematography, I perceive has been a copy of Dil Chahta Hai while screenplay is non-linear & appreciable. The climax is different from the book & adds up little emotion to the film. Even if you haven't read the book, this one will give you a total feel of it.""I took the pains of making 3 Rock Ons!! for this,"" Anhishek Kapoor was himself quoted saying. And I second that. The glory of this adaptation is its screenplay, run time (135 minutes) & the audacity of film-making as a whole.Yes, there are some ennui-inducing sequences specially the romance thing which might... MIGHT annoy at times, but that is passable. Not much of dilly-dallying or item songs or stereotype ridden script or dialogs, this one. Indeed, KPC is a victory in itself! Yes, Gujarati people say it after achieving victory over kite flying, but after watching this, I too can say pretty much the same phrase with oomph. Except that the political hue was necessary, but the gore & violence made it look cranky. 7/10 for compressing such a magnificent book into a short film.BOTTOM LINE: Kai Po Che! is a pretty good film; a must watch this weekend (compared to Zilla Ghaziabad), but talking it with the likes of Dil Chahta Hai or Rock On!! would be mild disgrace to the latter because KPC doesn't talk more about friendship than it talks about its destruction. KPC will make you think, but it is not a GREAT* film as it tries very hard to achieve but still gets a cold spot.WATCH OUT FOR: Sushanth Singh Rajput, Manav Kaul, Amit Sadh & some tit- bits.*refers to actual meaning in the dictionary with in celluloid context.Can be watched with a typical Indian family?

1021,The Broken Circle Breakdown,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3015457/,"The Belgian feature The Broken Circle Breakdown has a booming political voice and a pair of committed performances but as a film it does not work. It is apparent that the narrative was moulded heavily for the screen but without fully embracing and adapting to the filmic medium. The story is about a couple named Didier (Johan Heldenbergh) and Elise (Veerle Baetens). They have been a couple for seven years and sing together in a bluegrass band. Didier wants to live like a cowboy because he loves American country music and Elise, while covered in her own tattoos that detail her previous relationships, is running a tattoo parlour. The couple is told their five year old daughter Maybelle (Nell Cattrysse) has been diagnosed with cancer. Using a non-linear structure, the director Felix van Groeningen cuts between this present day crisis and then back to when the couple first met. He also flashes forward to a pivotal future moment when Elise herself is being rushed to hospital. The shape of the narrative is a stylistic choice rather than a psychological one because the time shifts do not enrich the depth or meaning of the lives of the characters. The lead work by Johan Heldenbergh (Didier) and Veerle Baetens (Elise) is adequate and the music is cheerful but in spite of the bleak premise the film isn't an emotional force.The fate of a child and the subsequent breakdown of the family unit isn't a new idea either because there have been an immeasurable number of films depicting this tragedy. Lars von Trier's Antichrist (2009) is one of the recent and grimmer examples. For Groeningen the adaptation process is a far greater problem than originality. The script he and Carl Joos have written is from the play ""The Broken Circle Breakdown Featuring Cover-Ups of Alabama"", by Heldenbergh himself and Mieke Dobbels. One of the difficulties with translating a play to a film is the contrasting forms of the two mediums. A play is almost entirely dialogue driven, while cinema is largely a visual medium, relying heavily on images to tell a story. The play apparently featured a number of monologues that Groeningen admits would not have been cinematic if they were included in the film. Consequently, some of the characterisation has been lost and the two characters seem rather flimsy. Groeningen has also said that he has not plotted the film through story but emotion, which accounts for why it isn't very eventful till late in the piece and why it lacks a strong through-line. Similarly, Maybelle's sickness forces the two adult characters to be reactionary and express themselves largely from their emotions and dialogue, like a play, rather than providing them with something to act upon. The music performances are injected to redeem this problem and to provide more ""action"". They are a pleasant diversion, even though the instruments are sometimes too loud for the singing voices. The bumps in the script must have been visible to Groeningen because he tries hiding them within the non-linear storytelling. He admitted that the structure was developed in the film's editing process. For a little while the dual timelines dissolve the story's dramatic simplicity. A slick overlap between the timelines contrasts Didier and Elise building a home for their child and then cuts to the present as they bring Maybelle back to the finished property from the hospital. However, the structure is largely window-dressing, covering for what is mostly a simple melodrama with loud political ideas. Didier and Elise exist to verbalise an ideological and social debate. When tragedy strikes, Didier blames the Bush administration for fighting against stem cell research, while Elise is driven by her faith and the possibility of spiritual healing. The director offers no subtlety in expressing Didier's atheist viewpoint. He zooms in on footage of George W. Bush speaking on television and allows Didier to yell at an audience, in monologue style, about the failures of the US government and religious conformity. The play originally came out in 2008, just a year after the Bush administration was replaced. The scientific debate would have been timelier several years ago. Once the tragedy unfolds and the flashy narrative structure is pared back, the film's verbal friction takes over and the parents blame each other for the grief in their lives. But everything is pitched at such an overly melodramatic level that I found myself resisting the film rather than being moved by it.",The Broken Circle Breakdown

The dialogues are also excellent and careful written as well as the casting.
I understand that many other movies like Infinity War, Avengers etc. are considered by most to be 'better', but if you watch this specific movie twice or more, you will realize that you are facing a masterpiece in all respects.

1026,Nebraska,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2915013/,"While the film has generally received anywhere from positive to rave reviews, I am decidedly in the opposite camp. It would appear that Payne was attempting to create some sort of dark comedy, but in my opinion the result turned out to be simply a tedious cartoon. All of the characters with perhaps the exception of the son Dave played by Will Forte, seemed very two dimensional with little, if any, depth unfolded or transformation effected by the conclusion of the film. The character of Woody Grant never moved beyond a sad and pathetic 75 year old man with a brain addled by a long history of alcoholism and cursed with the onset of Alzheimer's. Payne painted this in broad brush strokes with the character mostly gazing off into space, saying ""Huh"" when spoken to, and daydreaming with his mouth open. His wife Kate was something out of an Al Capp comic strip, a sort of overdrawn termagant wife played by June Squibb who usually yelled her lines to the camera, sort of like Olive Oyl as the ultimate bitch. The minor roles of the aging townspeople in the fictional town of Hawthorne, NE where Woody and his family visit en route from Billings, MT to Lincoln, NE in his quest to collect a $Million in a scam magazine sweepstakes, were equally as shallow and simply included, in what seemed to be a cynical stereotypical portrait of a small town in Nebraska, a collection of quasi Grant Wood American Gothic zombies, who do nothing but drink at the local pub and watch football on television. Local Nebraskans will tell you that older people in these communities are far more in touch with the world, and not living any kind of isolated life that may have existed 60 years or so ago or the bleak kind of picture of the past which Payne seemed to be trying to paint.I might subtitle the film as Nebraska: A Road Trip in Circles. From what I could gather, the storyline was supposedly intended to trace the process of family bonding (primarily that of son Dave and father Woody) through a bittersweet road trip revisiting family and friends along the way. Usually road trip movies offer some degree of character transformation by the conclusion. Here there seemed little if any change. Woody was still living his life in a hazy daze though now possessing a new truck and generator purchased for him by his son when they arrived in Lincoln and discovered there was no prize money. While his wife Kate exhibited one fleeting moment of tenderness toward Woody near the end of the film in a perfunctory kiss on the cheek, there was nothing to suggest that there would be any difference in their ensuing lives together. Perhaps the son Dave may have felt a bit closer to his father after the trip, but heading back to Billings, there seemed little sense of that. Again, I have no idea of what exactly Payne was attempting to accomplish with this film. It was anything but comedic or tragic or any kind of subtle ambiguous satiric mixture of the two. There was, however, some wonderful shots of rural landscapes, but unfortunately, the fine cinematography didn't prove quite enough to redeem the film overall.",Nebraska
1027,Nebraska,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2907849/,"Alexander Payne is one director who marches to the beat of his own drummer - films in Nebraska, uses black and white, and casts some parts locally to get the correct flavor. He doesn't miss a note.Nebraska is the story of a family of usual dysfunctionals living where else but Nebraska - a quiet, distant father with a little dementia, Woody (Bruce Dern), his two sons, David and Ross (Will Forte and Bob Odenkirk), and their perpetually complaining mother Kate (June Squibb). David sells home electronics and just broke up with his girlfriend; Ross works for a news station and recently replaced the ""talent"" up front.The current major problem is that Woody has received something akin to a Publisher's Clearing House certificate telling him he's won a million dollars. All he has to do is buy these magazines and check if the numbers are his. All Woody sees is that he won a million dollars. No one will take him to Lincoln to claim his prize so he starts walking - more than once - until David says he will take him.On the way, they stop by his parents' home town and drop in on Woody's brother and his family - a scary bunch. Kate takes a bus in and shows David around the cemetery in a scene you'll never forget, trust me. Woody runs into his old partner, Ed (Stacy Keach), and as word spreads that Woody is going to be a millionaire, everybody wants a piece of him, including Ed, who says Woody owes him quite a bit.This is really a character-driven film, with some of the most vibrant, fleshed-out characters ever on screen and some of the starkest landscapes, filmed in black and white, and giving the viewer the feeling of what it's like to live among miles and miles of farmland interspersed with small towns.Bruce Dern gives an Oscar-worthy performance as a lifelong alcoholic who has escaped inside himself, a man out of touch and seemingly untouched by any events around him. As the outspoken Kate, June Squibb is absolutely hilarious - always yelling at Woody, threatening to put him in a home, complaining about him, but just don't let anybody take advantage of him, or you'll have to deal with her.The sons mirror their parents, with David quiet and thoughtful but trying to bond with his father, and Ross, more confident and less sympathetic.In learning about his father's background, in talking with his old girlfriend (Angela McEwan) David begins to see the man that his father once was and what shaped him. And he finds out that love is sometimes an unspoken thing, but it's there all the same.A wonderful film, powerful in its simplicity. Don't miss it.",Nebraska

Let's clear things out, this film is not about a school or the basis of education, this is about trying our best not to give a damn about others as most of us just go around doing everything in our power to be happy ourselves with a lousy job, a loveless marriage, a constant sense of abandonment or basically a crappy life (all of the above portrayed marvelously in the film).Films by Tony Kaye tend to be really visceral with a thin slice of optimism in the undertones, I think this time he just went mental about everything, in the end you'll leave the theater with a slight sense of hopelessness, almost as if you're destined to watch daily misery without the power to control anything but your own life, as if the only battle you must fight is the constant reminder that even when everything falls apart and slowly turns into dust, you can't change the world, you just have to avoid the world from changing youThis exposed stunningly in the final sequence of the movie.Do yourself a favor, watch this film!",N/A
1032,Midnight in Paris,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2506921/,"Woody Allen has done an excellent job in Midnight in Paris (MIP).There are a lot of special features about this movie. The dialogue (script), the acting, the score, the cinematography.Midnight in Paris provides a lot entertainment without essentially ""going anywhere."" It isn't an extraordinary story. It doesn't provide some deep meaningful message. It's merely a bunch of interesting dialogue mixed with outstanding acting put together to provide good entertainment.The kind of entertainment I speak of in MIP isn't the ordinary type of ""entertainment."" It's a rare kind of entertainment and can only be found in certain movies. Pulp Fiction is the other prime example that springs to mind. Although very different in genre and script, there was one broad striking similarity I noticed between the two movies. They both have no purpose, no story (or at least, the ""story"" is used as a scapegoat to present the desired script in the movie), there basically isn't any real ""reason"" to see the movie. It's just about nothing. But what both movies succeed to do is just make you watch the movie, immerse yourself in it, provide you with a different kind of ""comedy."" It isn't comedy that makes you laugh out loud (for the most part) and it isn't failed comedy. It's the kind of comedy where you simply get subtle enjoyment from, you let out an occasional smirk or smile, but the smirk isn't necessarily in relation to the a specific comment in the movie, rather it's a smirk signifying your quiet enjoyment towards the film generally. You can sit there continuously for hours and days following repeated viewings of the film and not get bored simply because its so enjoying to watch. That's the kind of entrainment MIP offers and for the very same reason, it will attract negative attention from certain viewers, but not from me.Next, the cinematography. Oh my gosh! I could have given this movie a 10 without the rest of the movie being so good. I, having visited Paris, for unfortunately not too long a period, fell in love with the city. It is the most romantic and beautiful city I have ever seen. It really is the city of love and all expectations were not only as good, but better. I hold this thought even though some friends I know of have had, well, not as great an experience as myself.Woody manages to capture the beautiful presence of Paris like no other director. I felt like I was back in Paris and it sometimes managed to put a chill down my spine because of the amount of beauty I was both witnessing and remembering. I really can't say anymore about the cinematography except that it is the best, it is flawless, it is exceptional and if you have ever been to Paris and loved it, you'll definitely love this movie.Moving onto the acting, I'll settle this briefly. Although MIP has a lot of very solid small roles (Rachel McAdams was very average, but I think that's how her character was intended to be), Owen Wilson is the complete stand out. Although I can't quote statistics, I think this may be the first movie Owen Wilson has been in which has scored and 8+ on IMDb. To put this bluntly, I'm not an Owen Wilson fan. I generally don't like his comedy. But in MIP I have never met any other actor who fits the lead role so perfectly. To put it metaphorically, Owen fits into MIP like a glove. I have never seen such an flawless representation of Woody Allen himself. Owen is Woody. And therein lies the perfection of his acting. He barely needs to act, because I know all he's doing is being himself and dishing out lines given to him, but it fits so perfect with a Woody image. All in all, MIP is Woody Allen movie, with a Woody Allen touch, a Woody Allen script, a Woody Allen cinematography and a Woody Allen leading actor.Unfortunately, I can't express a very specific audience to which I would recommend this movie to. If you have been to Paris and loved it, chances are you will love it. It captures the beauty, the fashion, the culture and personality of Paris like it really is Paris. However, like I stated before, the dialogue in this movie and the ""story"" and ""purpose"" is something which will attract mixed feelings. I, for one, absolutely loved it. All I can say is that, if you agree with my comments above or if they touch an emotional nerve, then the chances of this movie doing the same to you is very high.It is nothing too special. It doesn't provide a great message. It doesn't have a extraordinary story. But it provides for a rare kind of entertainment, coupled with exceptional cinematography and for these reasons, I cannot give any less than a 10.",Midnight in Paris
1033,Midnight in Paris,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2436343/,"There's something about the midnight hour, something special, mystical, and magical. In the case of this marvelous movie, its impact is fully realized, as we see our protagonist suddenly realize that he has the opportunity to face that which he truly admires, treasures, and dreams about. In the opening scenes, he expresses his desire to settle in the city of lights, and we know it's not going to be an easy thing to do. His girlfriend and he are quite different in their appreciation of what being in Paris means. She understands it's special, maybe from an aristocrat's point of view. He might be looking at it, as the dream place for an artist to find aspiration to fulfill his artistic goals.One night, he wanders into the streets of Paris and finds himself lost, only to find himself rescue by a party of night socialites who turn out to be quite famous in some literary circles. Soon, the screenwriter/aspiring writer has an opportunity to see himself living one of his dreams as well as slowly come to some surprising epiphanies as he discovers more and more who his new acquaintances might truly be, and most important what their dreams really are.The film is set in several time periods, and Paris glows intensely and seductively in everyone of those. From its overcast skies and reflective streets, showing lovely architectural details and its magnificent landmarks to the superb and lovely recreations of older time periods, one can't help being seduced, charmed, and inspired to find a way to show what a special place, and consequently what a truly magical film this might be.Performances are outstanding all around, with Cotillard once again stealing every second she is on the screen. Through her eyes and carefully delivered lines, we understand what attracts us to this special time and place. She is a gorgeous and very talented performer, one who might be truly aware of her standing, yet she doesn't dwell on it. She attracts many types, but her philosophy is unique, move on, enjoy, live the moment. In a way, she is like the city that has inspired Allen, and many others before him. Paris as a place might not be aware of its magnetism, its beauty, and its power. Cotillard's muse is the perfect human equivalent, a dazzling and potent woman, who moves from man to man, place to place, time to time, and who surprises us with her own wishes near the end of the story.Wilson inhabits the Allen persona, and he does a very good job, not creating a tired imitation, an annoying cliché that could have ruined the perfect balance of sight, sounds, and insightful dialog, keeping this masterpiece way ahead of the best Allen has offered before. For those of us who gasped during the fantasy sequences of ""The Purple Rose of Cairo"", the marvelous recreations of the stage in ""Bullets Over Broadway"", the dissection of relationships in many of his best films, get ready to see it all finally come together, as he picks from the best, and adds his personal touch, with many a funny and clever observation, uttered by Wilson with a honest and complete sense of wonder. Unlike many of his leading men, Wilson displays an innocence which allows him and us to see his adventures in a fresh light.""Midnight in Paris"" is a beautiful display of what movie magic can truly create, a sense of wonder long gone from contemporary cinema; This is a movie that entertains, teaches, and wears each one of its elements, like Paris bewitches us with every light, every facade, and every heartbeat of its music.",Midnight in Paris
1034,Gravity,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2883560/,"The big ""spoiler"" is that this is a big budget Hollywood move with a preposterous plot and lots of special effects. The problem here is that nobody could possible survive through any of this, and the special effects become a substitute for any meaningful plot. Even taken on its own terms, the movie makes no sense. Sandra Bullock has become an astronaut but lacks even the basic skills for that occupation. She tells us she always crash landed the flight simulator, and we find her thumbing through an instruction manual about the size of the instructions for a DVD player to figure out how to safely pilot a space craft back to earth. She even picks the buttons eeny, meany, miney, mo style. Add to this the contrived scenario that she has not only lost a child but also is ""revived"" and given a reason to live by the now dead George Clooney appearing in a dream sequence. And how great a movie can it really be where there is only one character (and almost no dialog) on camera for most of the film. The special effects are impressive, but what they've obviously done is use computer graphics to create all the weightless effects. As such, things remain weightless even when they shouldn't be, and you eventually become more interested in looking for the screw-ups than watching the movie. Please, please, please.

1035,Star Trek Into Darkness,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2802269/,"No lie, this was one of the worst movies I've seen in awhile. Thin, dull plot that's already a rehash from a prior film. Paper thin characters. Zero intellectual or emotional depth. There was nothing challenging about this story, nothing thought provoking or even intriguing. Basically, bad guy wants to blow some *beep* up and after a bunch of explosions and hand-to-hand fights and crappy one liners, he's stopped by our heroes. The end. This kind of formula occasionally produces an awesome movie or two, but those movies are usually fresh and intelligently made in some way that makes them stand out. This movie was not intelligently made, not at all. Seriously, the writing here seemed like a seventh-grader's rendition of how adults are supposed to act: the Uhura / Spock 'fight' was like a scene you'd overhear in a middle school hallway or something. It was laughable. The few moments that should have been stirring sucked because they were just straight rips from Wrath of Khan. On screen, it seemed like explosions, gunfire, and lens flare dominated probably 80% of the shots, and the effects looked like something from a B-grade Xbox game. There was so much CG ""action"" that it all ended up being pretty boring. I never felt any sense of danger. Worst of all was that constantly swelling score with the same series of notes over and over and over again. You know what I'm talking about. I mean, damn, it was cool the first couple of times, but when the 18th minor protagonist triumph was accompanied by this same bombastic progression, I was curled up in a fetal position. Please, just make it stop. Beyond all of these issues, Star Trek was never supposed to be about endless violence and effects and one liners. It seems like Abrams has turned the series into a moderately more upscale version of Transformers, and it's too bad. There was so much more that could have been done. So yeah, this movie sucked. A lot. I can't believe the rating it has on here. I'm starting to wonder if most of the voters work for the studios or if they've received lobotomies or something...",N/A
1036,Beasts of No Nation,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3345898/,The problem about a film on a child soldier in Africa is that child actors are hard to direct and are usually not good actors. That cannot be said for Abraham Attah who embodies his character and makes us feel all his pain as the movie progresses. The first part of the movie where everything is good is all the more heartbreaking when everyone gets shot down. We slowly see how a child's mentality can be twisted and controlled by a charismatic but ultimately shallow Idris Elba who as always kills it in his role. The action sequences remind me who directed the movie as the controlled chaos is very Fukunaga and he excels at those scenes. They all have emotional motive and impact and are very realistic. The problem that the movie has are too many minor plots and minor characters take too much screen time. The commander's second and command and Agu's foil/ friend are well utilized but extend the movies long screen time. The ending was a bit of a letdown as Agu and the army leaves the commander in the jungle without any real payoff.,Beasts of No Nation

The film doesn't specify what part of Africa it is, but you know it is something that is real.Netflix doesn't hide anything about the realities of what happens to families, children, fathers, and brothers, as well as the numbness the war leaders (on both sides, really) have toward excessive and brutal violence. Imagine: the film shows all of this through the eyes of a boy, probably only 12 years old. He is forced into a mercenary squad after his family is torn apart, and he experiences something that is even darker than hell itself.That young boy, played by Abraham Attah, puts on a performance I have never seen before in a child actor. Given the mature content of the film, it is quite unbelievable that the torn emotions any child would have, given this situation, is so clearly displayed and authentic. Every scene just tore at my soul; I wondered if it was really acting. And he wasn't the only one; women, children, and the ""extras"" in the film: are these people really doing their first major film? Each scene left me speechless.The emotional involvement I had with this film as a viewer is astonishing. I felt ashamed at myself for thinking my life had problems, for thinking my life was hard. I felt foolish realizing my immaturity in life, and felt embarrassed for us as America in general, for caring so much about things so materialistic and shallow, when people in Africa (and other parts of the world, no doubt), are fighting for their lives every day, being torn apart by corrupt leaders and greed.To compare this film, it is similar to The City of God and Blood Diamond, but in an of itself, it is certainly unique. It's a masterpiece.",N/A
1038,The Social Network,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2317089/,"I just want to get this out there right away and put the cards on the table so to speak: When I first heard about it, I had very little faith in this project. I was stupefied, confused by the thought of what attracted all this talent to this seemingly trivial story to begin with? Why would David Fincher and Aaron Sorkin possibly be interested in the story of the founding of Facebook? Surely they could have found something more important, more meaningful to apply their efforts to. After seeing the film, though, I realized that, of course, Fincher and Sorkin knew what they were doing all along. And furthermore that labeling this as ""The Facebook movie"" is really an insult to what Sorkin and Fincher were trying to and have succeeded in achieving with this film.First and foremost, I have to take a step back and admire this film as a technical achievement. Despite seeming to be a departure for Fincher in terms of content and subject matter – which it is and then again isn't – the film is very clearly and undeniably a Fincher film. Re-teaming with his Fight Club director of photography Jeff Cronenweth, Fincher manages to create and capture that really unique look all of his films have. The cinematography is absolutely gorgeous – once again, Fincher proves that he is probably getting the best results in digital photography out of any other director working in that medium, and this film, shot on the RED One camera, looks absolutely beautiful, from the framing to the camera movement to the lighting and on to the look and the feel of the depth of field the RED captures.Sorkin's script is also an impeccable achievement and showcases, once again just what a genius this man really is. From a structural standpoint it employs a very effective use of a framing device – the Zuckerberg lawsuit depositions, which introduce the various characters and lead into ""flashbacks"" of the events being discussed. It really lends the film a Rashomon air and intensifies the mystery behind the Zuckerberg character and what exactly transpired in the creation of this phenomenon, Facebook. Sorkin also demonstrates an acute awareness of character construction, and manages to create a loathsome protagonist we hate and are frustrated by but yet we still end up sympathizing with. Most of all, though, it's a showcase of Sorkin's impeccable writing style and knack for writing dialogue with a very unique sound and rhythm. I saw Fincher refer to it as ""Sorkinese"" in an interview, and this is a really good description – it is certainly very unique to Sorkin and the scripts he has written, and it is also certainly a completely unique language – one which normal people in our real world do not speak, but that just sounds great on screen. The rapid-fire, overlapping dialogue remains one of the highlights of the film for me, and the script is certainly a shoo-in for Oscar consideration.The film is also a rare showcase of pure acting prowess, and features a very interesting and eclectic cast of young actors stepping out of their comfort zones and delivering some truly phenomenal work. The casting of the film is quite a departure for Fincher, who has enough clout to gather the biggest names working in the business. Instead, he opted to go for a cast of relative unknowns or up-and-comers, and really make stars out of them. First and foremost to be mentioned is Jesse Eisenberg, an actor I have personally been a fan of since The Squid and the Whale in 2005 and one whose work I have continued to enjoy since then. However, no matter how good he was in those previous films, none of his previous performances compare to his amazing achievement on this film. Stripping away his signature goofiness and neurosis, Eisenberg plays Zuckerberg as a cold, calculated and determined genius who knows what he wants, is very confident and forward-looking and will stop at nothing to get it. His counter in the film is Saverin, played brilliantly by Andrew Garfield, a name we will be hearing a lot more of of in the next few years: Saverin is a far more sympathetic character, more warm and inviting – these traits only increase the impact of the tragedy of Zuckerberg's betrayal of their friendship.Many pundits and commentators have designated this to be the ""film that defines our generation"", and truly a ""product of its time"" in the most literal sense of the word. However, I'm not sure I like this designation, especially since once you watch the film, you very quickly realize that this isn't a story about the founding of Facebook; it's really a story of friendship, ambition and betrayal, a character study of this fascinating individual whose actions in the film happen to depict the invention of an online social networking site that gets out of hand and puts all of his relationships, especially that with his best friend and business partner, in jeopardy. All of the themes mentioned above are universal and can be applied to a number of fantastic films and works of fiction over the centuries, and that, I think, is the greatest achievement of the film.",The Social Network
1039,X-Men: First Class,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2448885/,"Out of all of Marvel Studios' films, the 'X- MEN' franchise is one of my favourites. This is because of the great special effects, explosive action scenes, hot babes and the frequent comedic moments. When I heard that a prequel to the series was going to be made, my brother and I were really excited because we knew that it was going to be super AWESOME! And it was. But let's face it, the movie did have it's flaws, it being the lame writing or the not- as good as X Men 3- special effects, even my favourite mutant, BEAST had his flaws, but I'll get to him later.PROS: The great parts about this movie was the near- perfect casting. James McCavoy is great as always as the awesome Professor X, as he showed us a side of the character we have never seen before! He was charming, cool and very courageous! Michael Fassbender was also good as Erik Lensherr (MAGNETO) and we also get to see how he became the menacing Magneto in the later movies. It's just his accent that jerked me off. Other than that, he did a good job. Other actors that were good were January Jones as EMMA FROST and Kevin Bacon as SEBASTIAN SHAW, he was a cool, likable yet believable villain. The writing was great, I loved the idea of including the clip about young MAGNETO from 'X MEN' in the beginning of the movie. The direction was very awesome, with the director being Matthew Vaughn.CONS: I'm going to keep this part as short as possible because I don't want you to be turned off by the negative aspects and focus more on the positive. I guess my biggest flaw for this film, in my opinion, is the video game-like special effects. I don't know what it is, it's just that it didn't look as cool as the previous films, it was just too noticeable that it was CGI. Like I said at the beginning, the dialogue was a bit crappy, for example, at the end of the movie when MAGNETO is called by his real name and says 'Actually, I prefer... Magneto!', which my friend then turned to 'Actually, I prefer... Potato!' The make-up for BEAST kind of sucked, but it was still very well done.Overall, this isn't a bad movie, it's a good movie! It's a fun Blockbuster Summer action film to enjoy with your friends, so if you're walking into the cinema, hoping to see something like 'THE KING'S SPEECH'. Then you'll be disappointed. But see it anyway... it's the X MEN! See the movie! 9/10",X-Men: First Class
1040,X-Men: First Class,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2436748/,"There are plenty of big action scenes throughout but it's the first half of the film that really impresses. Establishing these characters and the entire universe is done remarkably well and in a remarkably moving manner. This new spin on familiar ""bad guys"" Magneto and Mystique does give the actions and emotions for the characters a new level of appreciation and helps give them so much more depth and pathos. Both sides of the fence (Xavier's vision and Magneto's contempt) are advanced and the brilliance of the plot is that both sides are understandable and relatable. The viewer can simply sit and watch it unfold but also be emotionally invested in the journey. During the second half, plot threads move towards resolution and action picks up. Xavier is a shining example and his journey throughout the film matches that of Erik.First Class never undermines the audience nor talks down to them and does all that is expected of it. It delivers great action, humor, effects and a strong connection between heroes, villains and those developing in between. The retro design is suave and making this a period piece gives it a cool and unique flavor. The collaboration between Singer and Vaughn apparently was a perfect blend. Vaughn did a brilliant job and Singer's vision from the first two films stayed in tact and was enhanced. I have to add that the score had a perfect heroic theme but was also moving and very well done. The overall impact of this film leaves you with a great sensation of a job well done. Fast paced yet filled with depth, spellbinding visual effects and a gripping finale. In the end, they succeeded in re-establishing these characters in a superb and interesting manner. There is more to offer and more depth to appreciate. I certainly can't wait for a sequel and inclusion of Scott and Jean from the original trilogy.",X-Men: First Class
1041,The Hangover,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2086079/,"Every now and then, there's a movie that has a lot of hype surrounding it, and everyone seems to talk about it, and without a doubt, ""The Hangover"" is one of those movies.Unfortunately, it doesn't live up to or deserve the hype it's getting. I found it to be a rather empty ""comedy"" and I can't understand why so many people seem to think it's so humorous. Apparently, I wasn't the only one not to enjoy it, the audience I was a part of barely let out a snicker during the entire flick.I think a lot of the attempts at humor were forced, and a lot of the jokes fell flat. The acting wasn't very impressive either, particularly that of Zach Galifianakis.Overall, I'd say to avoid this movie if you don't want to be disappointed. Is it the worst movie I've ever seen? No. However, there are far better comedies out there I'd recommend over this for sure.",The Hangover

1043,Skyfall,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2700833/,"One of the worst films I have ever seen. Every single scene was flawed and had errors. From beginning to end the movie had mistake after mistake. Now most movies have one or two mistakes and you just over look it but when it happens in every scene of the movie, you can't just wave it to one side.For example, when Bond leaves the London underground and starts running to save M. Here we have TWO errors. Firstly, M does not do MP's committee meetings and secondly, why does Bond run half way across London to get to her? Why not stop one of the police officer's to either drive him or to give him the car? There are so many errors, like I already said in EVERY single scene of the movie.Few others that I still remember are such as the opening scene, why does Eve who just mistakenly shot Bond with an automatic rifle not then open fire on the bad guy? How did Bond even survive such a drop? How did he end up in the arms of a beautiful woman on a beach? How did Eve even miss shooting him jumping on the train earlier? Why did the bad guy who had an automatic pistol and had Bond pinned down behind a wooden market stall decide to jump on a motorbike rather than to kill him? Why did the police bikers even drive straight towards a man firing a weapon? How did Eve even turn up with a vehicle just as Bond left the building? So many errors and so many gaps and that's just the first 8 minutes! I can go on and on and on. EVERY scene had massive errors, Even the Aston Martin DB5 scene, how comes Bond has it? Why would he even run away with M and get her killed? Are the SAS on strike? How did Bond leave the casino in Macau after killing 3 bodyguards? Does a large casino only have 3 security guards? Why even would they fight? Surely they would have just shot him as soon as he enters the casino? Javier Bardem's baddie character was ridiculous and comical. It was totally unbelievable, even an 8 year old wouldn't believe the storyline. Poor acting and the camp/gay innuendos were painful to watch. I couldn't believe what I was watching.This was an appalling movie. It relied on Judi Dench to hold it all together. Sadly I am not able to give it a 0 so I will give it 1/10. No action in the movie what so ever after the opening scene. Two men hugging on top of a train has been done so many times. Pathetic movie and the only people who will enjoy this are the brain dead. Shame on critics who were saying this was the best Bond movie ever, you should be ashamed of yourselves.I used to like Daniel Craig as Bond but thanks to this movie I now dislike him too. Well done to Sam Mendes and Co, it takes a certain amount of talent or the lack of it to single handedly destroy Bond. The hero in this movie was the final credits, the real baddie in this movie was the man behind the camera.",N/A

1045,Silver Linings Playbook,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2723188/,"I wanted to like this movie, I really did. I had read about the plot and its depiction of mental health issues and I was hoping to see a wonderfully nuanced movie with people fighting to get well. Instead, this movie was clichéd and clumsy. It was a movie without direction, it had no playbook.I'm going to assume that the book has more depth than the director cared to give the characters and that this is just a really poor adaptation to film. The characters are so incredibly flat and one dimensional and not at all a good representation of people with mental health issues. In fact, I think some damage was done here as not all depressed people get manic and destroy things at the drop of a hat or run out and sleep with a bunch of people. They're not all at odds with their doctors. There were just so many bad generalizations in this movie about the mentally ill I can't even list them all. The entire premise makes no sense. Why would you even set two people up who are at those points in their lives? It would be reckless to set up a woman still binging on sex with a man who was obsessed with his wife. I could go on and on. The entire story just didn't work. At all.Aside from the script the film craft was one of the worst I've seen this year! I counted about 5 gaffs in the movie before it was even halfway through. These were not small gaffs but obvious things you'll notice and I'm not sure how the editor missed. In addition to that, the movie just didn't flow well either. The running scenes looking staged and lifeless. He wears a trash bag to work up sweat...but never seems to sweat. He was supposed to be out of shape, but is definitely not out of shape when they show flashbacks. So many gaffs.I'm guessing people were just voting this movie highly because of Bradley Cooper and Jennifer Lawrence are attractive together.

1047,Argo,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2752712/,"This movie was so horrible that I can't even begin to describe it.First, I'm going to break it down in 2 sections: the technical part and the historical aspect.The Story was a mess and cliché. Such stories have been done so many times that 2 minutes within the movie you are able to guess every event and turnover that the story is going to take: An Unknown CIA agent who has troubles with his wife and family goes on a dangerous, life threatening mission to save the lives of Americans. In the process, he disobeys a direct order, accomplishes the mission, comes back home and gets a medal for it. And he is reunited with his family. And everyone lives happily ever after. The end.That's the movie, summed up. And I can bet everyone can agree that it's a cliché and overdone story. Other aspect is the historical aspect. I'm from Iran myself (but I don't live there now) so I know exactly what went down. Let me start by saying that the movie in fact IS a true story but it's not the WHOLE truth. They managed to ""forget"" some important notes that I'm sure lots of people noticed but chose to ignore it because of all the undeserved hype around the movie. First thing is that the U.S government could give up the Shah at any time and got the hostages back in a moment's notice. But they didn't. Why? Didn't the lives of 60 US citizens outweigh the life of a dictator who needed to be brought to justice? This was never mentioned. Secondly, the Canadians role; it's very popular among the people to call that mission ""Canadian Caper"". The Canadians had a HUGE role in this process. In fact they had the main role. They were the ones who issued REAL Canadian passports, they were the ones who arranged the flights and coordinated people within Iran. But we see their role cut down substantially to just the mere presents of the Canadian Ambassador. Thirdly, the movie fails to mention that the attack on the US embassy in Tehran was a result of decades of the US interference in Iran's politics and decision making; All the way from appointing prime ministers to staging coups. That's what drove the people to that point, and the film, once again fails to mention that. The film goes on to do what a typical Hollywood ""true story"" does. Dramatize actual events and make it into a Hollywood film. and a typical Hollywood ending scene (which never happened in real) Once again, horrible, horrible movie. Rating 4/10 : Only for the visual effects and production design which was adequate.",N/A

1049,Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2368952/,"*complete spoilers*The first scenes went something like this: Everyone drinks a nasty potion that makes them look like Harry and they get undressed on camera spouting anti-climatic, fast-paced jokes. Then in what *should* have been an exciting chase-scene, Hedwig plummets to her death. Harry is traumatized. Later he learns Mad-Eyes also died and, not giving him much thought, 'zips Ginny up' in and abrupt oh-so-passionate-scene with as much charisma and heart as a toaster.Harry then meets a witch who tells him bad things about Dumbledore which he instantly believes even though he's known her for all of, what, ten seconds, and Harry falls into a depression. Kinsgley warns the wedding party (oops, I forget to mention. Ron's brother Bill is getting married. y'know, Bill? That one Weasley child no one ever mentioned or casted? Him.) So, anyways, Voldemort took over the ministry (how exactly we'll never know) and is coming to kill everyone harry cares about (like Ginny. he does care about her y'know. they had their first love scene which lasted five seconds and was witness by George, who had a toothbrush in his ear.) So Harry, Hermione, and Ron run away because Hermione is a flipping genius who always saves their butts with advanced magic and bottomless purses.Okay. The action stops here.Now we are privileged to enjoy stunning landscapes and breathtaking landscapes of famous places all around the UK where the dynamic trio (make that duo: Ron leaves) set up camp. The audience is delighted to be separated from the rest of the plot and action-packed, intense moments happening in the outside world, and instead can focus their attention on the beauty of a certain tree that harry and Hermione are sitting under and discussing the evils of Dumbledore, the man who ruined everything.Hermione finds a doodle in a book and Harry and Hermione determine it MUST be a hint in a Blue's-Clues like moment of epiphany. Ignoring their new sense of purpose (besides finding lovely lakes to vacation by) Harry risks it all to return to Godric's Hollw and is there (unwittingly) attacked by a snake...lady...thing. They escape (Hermione, cough, cough) and return to their picturesque campsite.In the middle of the night Harry sees a patronus and, since of course NO ONE wants to kill him, deceive him, maul him, etc. He follows it like a complete nitwit. Luckily his hunch is correct and he arrives at a frozen lake, undresses, and takes a dip. A dark locket proceeds to choke him (why it couldn't choke him above-water, I haven't the faintest idea) but Harry is saved by Ron, who also manages to get his shirt off. With the sword of Godric, the two (still wet) decide to destroy the locket that so fiendishly attempted to strangle Harry (naughty object of darkness and evil).And then...Ron bears witness to a porn scene between Harry and Hermione who are inexplicably making out naked. (It is a very emotional scene.) Ron, fighting past the ridiculous apparition, smashes the locket to a million pieces and Harry and Ron return to Hermione and Ron spews some nonsense about a bubble of light in his heart.The three reunited, they reluctantly leave their gorgeous campgrounds to track down a madman in hopes of finding out the mysterious meaning of Dumbledore's Doodle. The madman is only too happy to oblige and tells them it is a very important symbol of a fairy tale, so now that they have this info their problems are over. Next the audience is treated to a Tim-Burton-like animated retelling of said fairy tale that TOTALLY goes with the movie (not). The madman then attempts to capture them but they escape (Hermione COUGH COUGH) but are captured by icky ""men"" who seem more interested in Hermione than in getting a reward for Harry Potter. The Icky ""Men"" take the trio to where Voldemort lives but Voldemort is away for the time being and will return momentarily, in the mean time won't you have a seat in this lovely damp prison cell while Bellatrix attempts to torture Hermione by biting her neck or whatever it is that she's doing?Voldemort doesn't show up (it's a *very* long holiday he's taking and he can't be disturbed) but Dobby does. Dobby's voice has undergone reverse-puberty, but that doesn't matter because Dobby has come to save Harry Potter because Dobby can materialize in and out of places, even the dark Lord's secret hideout.So Dobby rescues them (Luna and a Goblin in addition to the trio. Her dad was the madman I'm afraid. Yes, sad really how family units are organized.) Anyhow, Bellatrix stands there watching them escape and at the last moment throws a good-old-fashioned dagger into the air where they're disappearing and when they come out the other end Dobby says some lame last words in a girly voice and perishes, with Harry crying unconvincingly. Fade to black and Voldemort pops up (who's taken the failed capture of his worst enemy rather well, given the circumstances) and desecrates Dumbledore's tomb (and Dumbledore is amazingly fresh and un-decomposed) and takes Dumbledore's wand. He shoots a random red flare into the sky that serves no purpose whatsoever and the credits roll. Finally.Part 2. How exciting!",N/A
1050,Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2339003/,"""Deathly Hallows Part 1"" follows the book closely, but misses out on a few interesting scenes, and then makes up a few additional scenes that are poignant and incredibly welcome. In the beginning, it seems like the film's skipping through the book's content very quickly, but it makes sense, when you realise how much is going on. At the end, the beginning is far away, although the journey there doesn't make it seem like a long while. General opinion seems to be that it drags in the middle, but, let's face it, so did the book. There's no real reason to complain about Endless Camping Trips at all, because the film moves from plot point to set piece to plot point all the time. There's some clever ways the film handles its exposition, although it is not without its faults. The trio's acting is the second best thing in this film. Emma has improved loads over the past few years, and she seems to be at the top of her game in this film. Her acting is stellar. As usual, Grint gets saddled with the role of comic relief, but he also gets his chance to shine in an array of emotional scenes. Daniel manages to carry the story as the main character. The three manage to stand their own very well without the presence of the adult actors.Speaking of adult actors, Nick Morran's Scabior is a delightful character - he's slightly perverted and he has a bit of a Jack Sparrow vibe going on. Peter Mullan's Yaxley was impressive and managed to be quite threatening. It is a shame that we see so little of Bill Nighy's character, the new Minister for Magic, Rufus Scrimgeour. The character was regrettably cut from the previous film, and I wish they hadn't, if only to see more of Nighy's impressive performance. Old-time familiar faces are great, as usual. Fiona Shaw gets but one shot of screen time, but the look in her eyes says so much about her character. Jasoon Isaacs is terrific as a broken and devastated Lucius Malfoy. The lack of Rickman is a shame, but the presence of Bonham Carter makes up for it. Big baddie Ralph Fiennes manages to finally be a menacing, scary Voldemort in the film's first scenes, but as the story progresses and he gets appearances in a few messy, rushed and disappointing visions, Voldemort's actions just don't continue being an ominous cloud of danger, as they should be. The film's greatest achievement, however, is the animated sequence detailing the ""Tale of the Three Brothers"", an interesting wizard fairytale. It is a daring move from the filmmakers, one that will pleasantly surprise the audience.The biggest letdown is how the film doesn't just keep going. After two-and-a-half hours, it doesn't feel like the story's finished. A few scenes were added to make the climax more exciting, but it's just a downright shame that the movie doesn't just continue for another hour or two.",N/A
1051,Frost/Nixon,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1991164/,"I enjoyed Oliver Stone's ""Nixon"" and Anthony Hopkins' Oscar nominated portrayal was very good, yet the role was a largely negative version of the man. It was all deep paranoia and dark conspiracy, without any hint as to why Nixon was twice elected to the the highest office in the land, the 2nd time by one of the largest landslides in U.S. history.Ron Howard's ""Frost/Nixon"" is a fascinating view of Nixon through the perspective of the David Frost interviews. Langella's portrayal captures the insecurity and paranoia of Nixon, but also reveals a more intelligent and engaging aspect of him during his post Watergate years. I suppose this will automatically disqualify Langella from any chance of an Oscar nomination. I hope this isn't the case, because Langella's performance is on par with Helen Mirren's in ""The Queen"", maybe even better. Ron Howard deserves kudos for directing this excellent movie. He's become one of Hollywood's best Directors of historical dramas. The supporting cast was great, Michael Sheen as David Frost was outstanding, and everyone else was excellent.A truly outstanding film and for anyone with an interest in recent American history, not to be missed.",Frost/Nixon
1052,Frost/Nixon,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1961346/,"I had the pleasure of watching this gripping movie at the opening night of the British Film festival. Ron Howard's direction and story telling ability are in top form with this effort. From the very first scene a carefully crafted and very credible 70s's atmosphere sets a solid stage for the superbly cast film and quickly transports the viewer into the political jungle that was ""Tricky Dickey's"" playground.The acting duo of Frank Langella & Micheal Sheen (Nixon & Frost) are set on a collision course that finds two deeply passionate personalities at the mercy of their insatiable desires. Both actor's portrayals are a study of affectation and body language, pleasurably accurate and yet not simply an impersonation. Indeed, the film never strays from the distinct Howard format that breathes so much life (read intimacy) into this familiar and yet mysterious relationship that exists for so many people who lived through the exceptional event.Make no mistake, this is by no means a two man show, quite the contrary. In fact, the wealth of supporting roles is perhaps the finest feature of this production. Bacon's devoted and stalwart marine practically glints of gun metal and polished shoe leather. The trio of Gould, Platt and Rockwell portray effortlessly the roles of the men who, brick by brick, constructed the platform from which Frost so successfully and serendipitously elicited one of the greatest unspoken confessions of all time. Rebecca Hall is delicious and demure, constantly filling scenes with her elegant presence.Perhaps the richest praise should be reserved for Peter Morgan, who has, without question, penned a truly captivating and insightful story that delivers not only a satisfying comprehension of a complex time in US history, but captures a generation's struggle to come to terms with the frailty of leadership that still echoes today.Not to be missed, this film can be enjoyed on multiple levels and will undoubtedly be regarded as seminal for it's engrossing insight and expert depiction.",N/A

But it is burdened by two things. The first is that the wrapping story is large, heavy. The second is that we have a tedious explanation about why the slips occur: some invented device. And it adopts the Godzilla/Transformers model where two giants fight, towering over the city. Jees.Two things are superior, however. One is that the dreamworlds give the artist freedom to depart from the constraints of the real. It isn't surreal: that's a very specific thing. But you do have dancing refrigerators leading a parade to hell. You may not appreciate the visuals here, in fact I suspect most won't think them special. But I did.But the main thing is the title character, a lovely redheaded virtual soul who lives in the dreamworld. She's the pinnacle of girl fantasy: capable, not real, fairy-like but strong, desirable but forceful, following the rules of the world sometimes and writing the rules at other. She's woven from something deep in the psyche, our usually unfound soulmate who writes our dreams that spill into our lives.But her appearance and character isn't what amazes here. Its how many different ways the filmmaker has her interact with the dream world. I stopped noting them because they were so varied and clever. She flies of course, she morphs. She shares a body in the real world of a woman scientist. (There's a truly remarkable dream scene when a vagina is ""unzipped"" to the forehead to reveal the true woman within.) She merges with shadows, reflections, light and shadow. She appears from dolls and billboards, clouds. From cracks and folds. Its as if there was a list of all possibilities that is being exhausted. I will suggest that you see this before ""Millennium Actress."" Then both will blow you away.Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 3: Worth watching.",N/A
1054,Paprika,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1680291/,"I had gone into Paprika not knowing much of what to expect, save for the fact that it was an anime with quite a buzz. An hour and a half later, this is one of the best films I've seen in 2007.The plot, as best as I can describe it, concerns a group of scientists developing a device which allows one to interject your subconscious into and record another person's dreams. However, a thief is using the technology to terrorize and control others. As the scientists try to find their stolen property, reality begins to take on a different meaning...Satoshi Kon is filmmaker I've never heard of before, but what he has created is truly visionary. Paprika continually amazes with imagery which transcends conscious understanding and coherence for what can only make sense on a subliminal level. Examples include a marching band of inanimate objects, dolls and animals, a giant aquatic leviathan with a man's face and humanoid toys that act as vessels for their dreamers bodies.But what makes the film necessary viewing is not the visuals alone, it's the core of the story and varied themes that it poses. The subject matter deals with issues both contemporary and probable. The actual identities of ourselves are wrapped in an enigma. How science has its positive and negative aspects. That the advantages of the internet is better communication but also dehumanization. I'm sure others will find other symbolism and subtext.Wheather you're familiar with Japanese animation or not, Paprika will expose any newcomer to something foreign and deeply personal as well.",Paprika

1057,Flipped,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2409150/,"'Flipped' is truly a ""real movie"". Probably what most people enjoyed about this movie was that the events that happened in the movie could might as well have been their reality. Many people in this world (if not all) have experienced having a real crush. This movie shows a crush blossoming from both a guy's and a girl's view. It was very interesting to see two viewpoints on this everyday happening. That is what makes this movie so appealing. Viewers get to watch Bryce and Juli's emotions whenever they see the other. Viewers see Bryce and Juli's smiles that they can't help. Viewers get to know who exactly Bryce and Juli are.Anyone and everyone will enjoy this movie or can at least, relate to it. Even adults! This film will surely take you down memory lane and help you remember the feelings you had when you were first in love. I've never experienced being in love before, but this film makes it seem wonderful. I absolutely loved this film.Madeline Carroll and Callan McAuliffe were great in this film! Even if they're very young, they did wonderful jobs in performing here. In each of their scenes, you could sense the emotions that they were feeling and wanted to convey to the viewers. The characters themselves were also very interesting. Particularly Ms. Juli Baker. It was nice to see such a free-spirited teenager, who was very opinionated and didn't let anything stand in her way. The chemistry that both actors had were average. I thought that they showed their most potential when acting by themselves, in their own surroundings.I was pleasantly surprised when I found out that Rob Reiner, the director of this film, was the same person who directed 'When Harry Met Sally' and 'Sleepless in Seattle'. So far, all romantic-comedies that Rob Reiner has directed has not disappointed me. I can't wait for more of his works! All his rom-coms are excellent additions to the romance movie genre.This was an amazing teenage romantic comedy. Surely one of my favorites, right up there with 'When Harry Met Sally'. Do not miss this film. It's baffling to see that this film isn't as popular as it's supposed to be.Viewed on: April 5, 2011 ; December 16, 2011",Flipped
1058,The Girl Who Leapt Through Time,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3602986/,"Super-Minor Spoilers (in the form of the synopsis you can just read on the box of the DVD, so nothing obvious)Here Goes:The film itself is aesthetically pleasing and the voice acting is spot on, but that is about as far as this film goes regarding what it truly has to offer.The pacing starts off much too convoluted and quickly in order to get to the part where the protagonist can do the thing suggested in the title of the movie. Afterwards it slows down to a crawl in which the whole point of the story seems to be heavy on high school dating, which would be absolutely FINE in the realm of coming-of-age stories if it weren't for the fact that you really don't get an opportunity to feel pathos for any of the characters. There is so much potential there, but for the most-part there are no real dynamics within the interactions or relationships. Also, you get the strong vibe that if you say no to a boy when he asks you to date, you are too picky (just say yes to whomever demands it, I guess), so I don't see how this movie would also be good to show preteens/teens/children.This becomes another time-traveling movie where the protagonist has fun with their newfound ability at the beginning but then confronts consequences surrounding said fun, and there is nothing wrong with that. Unfortunately it is also a film where the character could have easily solved all of the problems that are beginning to form just by going back to the beginning and not messing around with anything.Also, the last 30 minutes of the film seem very phoned in. As if the writer looked back and said ""Huh, this really isn't going anywhere, let's see if we can just throw in some obvious tropes."" Just when you think it is all going to speed up and go somewhere, it really doesn't. Every action within this film just seems like a ploy to suck the viewer in with no real sense of finalized answers. Specific plot holes, and just blatantly overlooked explanations we would have liked to have known would have been nice to put in this review, but that would be hard to do without giving major spoilers. Trust me though, there are SO many holes and little things that a character could have simply done to solve this that, if you actually care about these kind of things in storytelling, would frustrate the heck out of you.Not recommended. It's OK, but nothing to write home about whatsoever. Definitely over-hyped.",N/A
1059,The Girl Who Leapt Through Time,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1675032/,"The poster of this animated movie looks a little suggestive, but nope, it's actually a wholesome time travel movie which explores a little on the vestment of such powers to a klutzy individual, as well as relationships, and the perennial question of what would anyone do if you have the ability to go back into time, and make changes presumably for the better.The Girl Who Leapt Through Time tells a wonderful story centered on 3 friends, the tomboyish and clumsy Makoto Konono (voiced by Riisa Naka), and two hunks Chiaki Mamiya (Takuya Ishida) and Kousuke Tsuda (Mitsutaka Itakura). Theirs is a friendship formed after school at the baseball court where they spend quality time talking about typical teenage stuff. Things start to change however, when Makoto by accident gets the power to time travel, and in her own ditzy way, uses her new found abilities for ""good"" - directly for herself, or in some Emma like moments, to influence the outcome of relationships for her friends and play matchmaker.And that's just scratching the tip of the iceberg. While it's animation style is kept simple and fairly straightforward, it doesn't compromise on the complexity of its storyline. Not that it serves to confuse, rather you'll be amazed by the amount of pathos the story contains, with its various subplots especially when the time travelling stuff kicks in. It has adult sensibilities in the treatment of the plot, and knows exactly when to hit the right emotional chords when warranted.Although based on a book, the story here serves as a quasi-sequel of sorts which takes place some 20 years later, what I can say is that the love stories intertwined has its major one being able to touch like that in Be With You. I loved that movie, and watching how this bore some similarities, you can't help but feel the same emotions coming across in the same way, nevermind that the characters here are animated, as you can feel the pain, the love, and their despair. And that is something that I should say is difficult for the genre - they're not real persons on screen - but yet being able to evoke emotions and for one to react and empathize, definitely makes it powerful, and a cut above others. Something that our local animated films had failed to do in giving us cold characters and bastardized stories from folklore.But it's not always all the time serious in tone or mood. The movie has light hearted moments, sometimes bordering on the slapstick, no thanks to the bumbling Makoto character. In a sequence, it was reminiscent of Chinese Odyssey starring Stephen Chow, where each time travel moment gets played ad nausem with different comedic effect. Undoing blunders as we see is not exactly Makoto's forte, and while she may be using her powers in a carefree way, with great powers come great responsibilities (sorry, can't resist that one!)As usual, anyone can find fault with the time travel paradox which rears its ugly head in any time travel movie, but I would suggest that you park those thoughts aside, and enjoy the story that the Girl Who Leapt Through Time is telling. There are slight attempts at addressing it with its creation of totally new and different realities with each jump, but even then a major paradoxical flaw still exists. At its lowest denominator, the film reminds to seize the day like it's your last, do what's right, and don't be shy in telling someone how you feel about them.The Best Animated Film of the recent Awards of the Japanese Academy, this film gets my vote of support too with its superbly emotional and touching tale, and with its similarities to that aspect of the film which I like to Be With You, it will be no surprise if this movie finds its way to my Top Ten of the year. Highly recommended!",The Girl Who Leapt Through Time

1062,This Is England,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1648335/,"This 80s set drama reinforces Shane Meadow's reputation as an actor's director and one that thank god, is actually interested enough in his indigenous culture not to take a cheque from a Hollywood studio and waste his talent making American genre movies. Danny Boyle take note. Paul Anderson, stay where you are.This is a considered, exceptionally well acted story centred on a 12 year olds adoption by a gang of skinheads in the months after his Father's death in the Falklands. Initially it's all harmless enough, smashing sinks and wasting time. They listen to good music and smoke dope  not a problem you may think, in fact I once worked for a man who essentially built a career on that. But things turn ugly when old gang member combo returns from prison, having had any vestige of racial tolerance buggered out of him. He's a proto-Nick Griffin, in the days before he opened an account with tie rack but with more visible tattoos, determined to fight the ""war"" against ethnic undesirablesand no, that doesn't means Geordies (I had to check that too). The boy is drawn in by Combo's pitch, particularly the part about wasted solders liberating sheep in the Falklands, which strikes a simplistic note and before you can say ""wasted youth"" trouble ensues.The period is vividly recreated, though Meadows can't resist having the greatest hits of the day playing on the radio as people walk down the street, and a cast who weren't even sperm and ovum in the real 1983, are superb and have a great career ahead of them, or rather would, were there an independent domestic industry to speak of. Mind you, Shane should be working for a while at least.What impresses are the finely rendered details. Mass recruitment to the National Front is portrayed in relatively benign terms  a cosseted meeting in a working men's club. There, then as now, a hatred of immigration and cultural diversity is rationalised as a rescue mission  hauling Englishness back from its diluted and fractious state to something bound to a fictitious idyll represented by the likes of Churchill (who opposed all emancipating reforms throughout the first three decades of the 20th century and pioneered the use of chemical weapons and labour camps), war time working class solidarity and that kind of male sack contents. Then, again as now, the ringleaders pass themselves off as respectable patriots, suited and business like, trotting out the familiar mantra of welcoming the hard working immigrant but rejecting the rest  ergo they're not racists at all. Obvious really! Having presented this pack of lies, Meadow's discredits it with equal verve. When combo storms into the hard working Pakistani shop owner's newsagent, threatens to kill him and steals his stock (because presumably working for it wasn't an option) there's little in the way of appreciation for the man's contribution to the economy. A simple ""thank you for the annual 2 billion pound surplus in 2007 money you and your fellow immigrants contribute, subsidising benefit dependent ex-cons like myself"" would have sufficed but no, its abuse a giant knife. As combo listens to Milk describe the simply pleasures of his family life  a scene that's like watching someone sit on a bomb you know is about to explode, his decision to try and batter him to death in a jealous rage is a tacit acknowledgement of what actually lies at the heart of the future BNP's membership - simple envy and bitter resentment coupled with an idiots view of history.When Meadow's explores the personal motivations for this hate his characters and the film as a whole have an air of authenticity, built on universally excellent and naturalistic performances. It's the attempt to tie the characters to the wider political and social context that strikes a false note.Meadows locates the mutation of the skinhead movement from anarchist to racist by showing us footage of the Falkland's war and Thatcher. Combos been in prison for three and half years and it isn't a coincidence that his captivity dates from Thatcher's accession to government  he's a symbolic globule of Thatcherite folly. Sending your armed forces to protect a hill and kill sheep Meadows suggests, proved a stark reminder of Britain's loss of status in the world and this, coupled with Maggie's systematic and ruthless destruction of the working class through mass employment and the atomising of society, which essentially ate like acid through traditional working class communities (which was always the point), was decisive in inflaming social tensions. This is a fair judgement of history but labouring the Falkland's as an inciting incident overstates its importance, when a more rigorous look at the domestic situation might have struck a stronger note. All of this suggests that while Meadow's is a vintage documenter of his own childhood experiences and has an gift for social realism, his credentials as a social historian are less secure.Mind you, this may be all a misreading. Perhaps Meadows is suggesting Roland Rat is responsible  the morning TV menace featuring in the opening archive footage, and who'd bet against it?",This Is England
1063,Ex Machina,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3239328/,"Rarely have I felt myself the ""one-eyed man in the land of the blind"" as when I was reading the plethora of positive reviews for this film.What so many critics praised as ""minimalist"", I found shallow: A one-dimensional, clearly ego-maniacal villain creates a flawlessly sympathetic A.I., with whom our equally-flawless protagonist cements an attachment. That, plus a fairly pedestrian game of cat-and-mouse between our 'tagonists, followed by an unsatisfying ending, defines the bulk of this film.What so many critics praised as ""thought-provoking"", I found nonsensical. The chance to parlay the dichotomy between evolved vs. designed intelligence through Ava's character was squandered by the decision to render her ultimate motives entirely inscrutable: a contrivance that may have been---but should not have been---the point. There were times when this film showed real promise, the potential to give real weight to the blurred line between human and synthetic self-awareness that will doubtless challenge us in years to come... but, alas, in service to its Pollock-painting motifs, it chose easy ambiguity over genuine insight.Superficially, this film is meaningful: It certainly tackles the questions of intelligence, of person-hood, of agency and of sentience in a world where all of the above can be designed by a psychopath.Unfortunately, those questions are damn important ones to tackle... and, in the end, ""Ex Machina"" in no way does them justice.",Ex Machina

1066,The Last King of Scotland,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1589707/,"A young Scottish Doctor flees his repressive home to go to Uganda. Now that's an oxymoron if ever I've heard one! Once there he joins a mission and ministers to the locals. He tries to fit in to the Christian role but temptation has thrown him a curve. The missionary's wife is a blond tressed, and quite sumptuous Gillian Anderson - with a bang on British accent and demeanor. Unfortunately for him, and fortunately for my fantasy life, she hesitatingly demurs. At this point Idi Amin happens to be in the neighborhood and takes a fancy to our young Doctor (completely ignoring Gillian, which tells us right off the bat that the man's not normal), for having the chutzpah to brazenly use Amin's pistol to kill a cow, mortally wounded by Amin's limousine.Our young naive, hedonist decides to take up Amin's offer to be his personal Doctor, and soon finds himself up to his elbows in African Alligators, namely your usual Dictatorial musical chairs.The character of the young Scot is pure fiction, but in the Uganda of that day, a quite likely one. He slowly realizes that his boss is a sociopath, but he is also a prisoner, knowing that to displease him is a tad risky. Still he is a headstrong youth, and continues to confront Amin when he sees fit to. Then he steps over the edge and does something totally suicidal: he sleeps with one of Amin's wives.The movie ends with the Entebbe hijacking of an Air France Plane full of Jews coming from Israel. Our hero uses the moment to escape - Uganda and certain death.Whittaker is great. Playing sociopaths is every actors dream, as you get to be so mercurially evil, and he milks it for all it's worth. But he's never over the top, or campy, or unbelievable. He plays Amin as the jolly genocidal maniac that he was, and, thank God, keeps away from more than a nod at his being a Muslim. Whittaker will win the Oscar. I also predict that if they ever have a movie about Saddam Hussein, that actor will also win an Oscar",The Last King of Scotland
1067,The Last King of Scotland,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1498010/,"""The Last King of Scotland"" is a slickly made powder keg of a film about Idi Amin's (Forest Whitaker) horrific dictatorship over Uganda in the 1970's as seen through the eyes of his fictionalized Scottish doctor (James McAvoy). Whitaker is mesmerizing from the word ""go"" and brilliantly displays how captivating a character Amin was: charming, theatrical, paranoid, and mad as hell.Director Kevin MacDonald only alludes to the horrors (300,000 massacred) while delivering a music-video style account of the free-wheeling decadence of Amin's regime while he still played in favor to his people. Much of the film runs like the early parts of P.T. Anderson's ""Boogie Nights"" or any gangster saga from Scrorsese: hyper-edited, smoothly shot scenes depicting humor, violence, sex, nudity, and overly-indulged individuals new to money and power. It would've been more compelling had tighter focus been paid to Amin instead of the highly unlikable doctor character, who for the most part comes across as a flighty, over-educated twit with foggy ideas on good deeds and uncontrollable hormones that lead him to hounding after every marginally attractive married woman he comes across, including a barely recognizable Gillian Anderson donning a British accent, and Kerry Washington as Amin's third wife (duh, doc!). About two-thirds of the way through, MacDonald lets Whitaker loose, and his rampage is awe-inspiring. It culminates in a pulse-pounding white-knuckle twenty minutes that muddle a historical event concerning Israeli hostages with the shockingly brutal finale of the young Scott's stay in Uganda. Again, it would've been more emotionally involving had the doctor been more deserving of our sympathy. Still, Whitaker is fuming and unforgettable. He totally embodies the spirit of the oft-discussed and debated mad dictator, so much so that when the closing credits roll and we see stock footage of the real Amin, you'd swear these were images of Idi Amin playing Forest Whitaker.",The Last King of Scotland

Hence, I broke it up into three nights at about 45 minutes a pop. It's really hard for it to hold your interest at all. Here's a helpful hint - watch it with subtitles on. The dialogue is also way too San Francisco local and the names of too many cities, lakes, streets, counties, and buildings are mentioned too fast and too often that it will make your head spin.

The film presents numerous details that were unknown to me before seeing it. All of these facts and theories are thrown together in a way that strings the viewer along, you think it's someone, then you get new information and that person is no longer a suspect. Fincher really puts you into the life of a detective working on the case. You feel just as excited when new information comes about and are equally disappointed when it leads to another dead end.The film is beautifully shot (on VIPER digital cameras) and once again, Fincher shows us his wonderfully adept skills with CGI shots. All of the actors shine and truly become their characters. Jake Gyllenhall and Robert Downey Jr. put in excellent performances, as does Mark Ruffalo. I was also pleasantly surprised to see Phillip Baker Hall join the ensemble.The only complaint I have heard that holds any water is that the film is too long. At roughly 2 1/2 hours, I can see how many would think that is long, but you have to realize that this is an intricate story with deep characters who need to be examined and understood. A standard 90 minute film, or even a two hour cut, would not have been able to tell the story as well. Character motivation and important details would have been left on the cutting room floor.If you have followed the Zodiac case, you will be happy to see how well done this movie is. If you don't know anything about the case, you will be given an excellent story that will make you want to learn more about it. Regardless, you should do yourself a favor and see this movie.

Where writer/director Christian Carion succeeds is in the way he presents the material for the screen.We are taken to the trenches, where German, French, and Scottish troops are seen fighting a fierce battle in which the Germans are showing a superior advantage from their side. During the exchange many soldiers die and are left in the snow covered field as the troops regroup to consider what kind of action to take.In the spirit of the Christmas holidays the men from each faction are given extra rations, ornaments, and even trees and liquor from each of their countries to celebrate the occasion. It's a wonder to see the German side awash with small trees that are lit and raised over the edge of their trenches. Suddenly, there is the sound of music everywhere and the commanders of each faction come together to declare a cease fire so the men can celebrate Christmas Eve.It's at this point that the main point of the film is made, as the terrible war seems to recede and all the men come together to rejoice, more like friends, than enemies. It's a lovely moment in which peace on earth seems to be achievable.As all this is happening, Anna Sorenson, a talented singer, comes to the German side to be reunited with her tenor husband, Nikolaus Sprink. They are instrumental for bringing more joy to the men by joining their wonderful voices to sing traditional songs and carols.Among the cast, Diane Kruger, Bruno Furmann, Guillaume Canet, Daniel Bruhl, Bernard LeCoq, Ian Richardson, Alex Ferns, and other actors from many countries come together to celebrate and forget the insanity and death that surrounds them.Christian Carion is to be congratulated for bringing this story to the screen as it shows human nature at its best.",Joyeux Noel

By depicting a unique event in European war history that occurred on Christmas day 1914 it shows viewers that Europeans can be as one even as ""enemies"".About ten years ago I watched Paul McCartney's video ""Pipes of Peace"" and thought that what it depicted was completely fictitious--nothing more than pacifists' dreams. I have now learned that it was true.",N/A
1073,Control,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1743791/,"Well...to be brutally honest, it was terrible. The film was really very weak and didn't entice in any way. The thing looked quite nice, all black and white monochrome photography, but even that was only good in spurts. Full of rock biopic cliché's, it was simply too easy to watch, a factor that jarred considerably with the dynamic that made Joy Division (and Ian Curtis) appeal to such a vast amount of people. This dynamic, typified by eerie and haunting atmospheres(excuse me) which seem horribly alienating at first but ultimately draw you in with the accurate depiction of the depths and despair of the human mind, is something that sets the band apart from the crowd. They created their own unique sound that transcended boundaries and created a new strand of punk music. This film was an opportunity to apply that ethic to another medium, to truly realise the essence of the man and the band.The line (paraphrasing): ""It feels like its somebody else, just wearing my skin"" is indicative of the films outward appeal and its mainstream tendencies. In fact, the film is far more malignant and sinister than Curtis' own dissolution.A travesty. The good bits(or the bits that weren't really bad), which were mainly the parts where the band were playing gigs, only served to make you feel horribly let down at how good the film could have been and how much of an injustice the source material had been paid. The casting seemed good on paper, having an unknown playing the main part and giving Samantha Morton a supporting role as the suffering wife. But it just didn't work. Morton was a cliché of the down-trodden and doting wife, all watery eyed and desperately attempting to put their problems out of her mind, and Sam Riley was far too much like a certain more modern 'punk icon', Pete Doherty. It was bizarre, I couldn't get him out of my mind, the big drawn eyes, the wiry gangly frame, the cocky charm, the theatrically wistful stare, it was ridiculous... And from what's been written, nothing like Ian Curtis; he wasn't attractive, he wasn't likable; he was an ugly, cold, self-involved person, and knew it. I won't mention the rest of the cast, as I feel I may just sound like an angry Joy Division fan. Suffice to say, the earlier comment about rock biopic clichés applies.I was so disappointed, thought it was going be good and it just wasn't. Simple as that. And I hate it when films try to condone suicide, its such a pathetic thing to do, the guy had plenty of people who cared about him, but still he screwed them all over. Some would argue that it doesn't condone it, it simply shows it, but this I would disagree with. Saying that, go see it, the songs are played well for the most part(the band who play Joy Division are actually a Leeds band in real life, and actually play the songs), and there are one or two really nice shots of Maccelsfield(!), particularly towards the start. One in particular of the couple sat under a tree just before he proposes sticks out. You may like it, I don't know, it seems plenty of people do for some reason!I appreciate that many will disagree with my opinions, which is fine, but just know that I care very much about cinema, and am very worried and disturbed when films such as this receive such acclaim.",Control
1074,Tangled,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2345743/,"Honestly, when is the last time you saw a decent Disney Animated feature? No no, PIXAR does not count. I'm talking about just a regular ol' straight laced Disney flick. If your like me, I'm sure your answer falls somewhere in the mid 90's. But isn't that a shame? What happened to the totally awesome Disney movies? If your excuse is because of technology, i assure you that your wrong. You can make a great animated movie without resorting to actual hand drawn art. But where is that old feeling we all use to share? Well i can tell you this much....i already knew that Disney had something special here, mainly because the VP of PIXAR jumped ship and decided to fund this project. The first time anyone from PIXAR has ever done so, let alone the freakin VP. So needless to say, Disney finally had enough, and pulled out all the stops for this one.I kid you not when i say this....""Tangled"" is easily the best Disney Animated feature i have seen since ""Aladdin"".....yes, it is that good. They finally let go of trying to find something new and different and settled with what was working for them almost 20 years ago. It's a princess tale that easily falls into the same category with the classics. So wait, does that mean i'm comparing it to the likes of ""Snow White"" ""Cinderella"" and ""Sleeping Beauty""? You damn right i am! Sure the storyline is cliché' and relative to other Disney classics, but it felt so good to see and feel something that helped recall your childhood. But other than those minor speed bumps, the movie is spot on. The animation is spectacular, and you would be a fool not to see it in 3D. The musical sequences didn't seem forced and were never boring. And i can almost guarantee you that it will snag the best song award at the Oscars. I'm just glad that they didn't work the story around the music, which is what a lot of animated features tend to slip up on. But this one did an amazing job of hybriding them together.Bottom Line, ladies and gentleman, this is the Disney picture you have been waiting for. It will definitely win your heart and please audiences both young and old.",Tangled
1075,Tangled,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2662593/,"Let me start by saying that I'm an 18 year old male, and was kinda dragged into watching this by my girlfriend, who is a big fan of the Disney princess movies. I finally gave in the other day, and I've very glad that I did. The movie looked gorgeous, the animation was spot on; all while holding on to the classic Disney feel. The main characters are extremely likable. Repunzel is your typical Disney princess style character: sweet, funny, etc. Eugene, aka Flynn Rider, kinda stole the show for me, but maybe that's because I'm slightly gender biased. Nonetheless, you can't deny his wit and humor. Maximus the horse fills the role of animal sidekick perfectly; just as good as Donkey was to Shrek even though he doesn't talk. While the plot is relatively predictable, it was still quite an enjoyable movie. I didn't find myself to be bored at only of the parts, and I was laughing a lot more than I had expected to. This movie is an instant classic, and a near perfect example of what animated fairy tales should be like if they want to appeal to a wide range of viewers, not just tween girls. The ending was sweet and should leave everybody happy. I think there's enough fun in this movie for all ages, including an 18 year old guy like me.",Tangled
1076,Brokeback Mountain,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1415495/,"The 2006 Best Picture Oscar was contested, primarily, by two 'issue' pictures  one dealing with race, the other dealing with homosexuality. But while one used a heavy-handed approach to deal with its subject, the other told its story with skill and restraint. The heavy-handed film won.Brokeback Mountain is always going to be derisively referred to as 'that gay cowboy movie' by the people who are predisposed towards disliking it, but even though people aren't used to male homosexuality being portrayed on the big screen in a non-comic way, it's really not a very revolutionary film - repressed love has been dealt with many times in cinema. But because it's two cowboys, the supposed embodiment of everything that is masculine, that are engaged in a passionate relationship, it takes on a novelty value and possesses a shock factor for those people who have been living under a rock and haven't realised that men have been bumming each other since the dawn of man. But thankfully the more worldly wise can just ignore the novelty and the supposed shock and enjoy a very good film.The opening part of the film is a tad slow (but not excessively so) and sees Ennis (Heath Ledger) and Jack Twist (Jake Gyllenhaal) working on Brokeback Mountain, looking after a farmer's livestock. There are no overt signs of their relationship developing into something more than it is, but all the time there are little hints. There are the sidelong glances; the look Ennis gives as he looks up at the mountain, perhaps contemplating his colleague; and the small smiles of satisfaction Ennis gives when Jack horses about. But rather than develop slowly over time, things explode one night in their tent. The sex scene that follows isn't loving or tender, it's violent. It's maybe years of frustration and repression being released. But the morning after, quite understandably, is awkward, and Ennis rides off to think about what happened. One of the first things he sees is a sheep that has been ripped apart by a coyote. The visual encapsulates his situation. All the time he's been a sheep  he doesn't stand out  but now his true nature has been revealed and violent repercussions are a definite possibility. (And later Ennis tells the story of how his dad showed him the dead body of a gay man when he was a kid. The man was beaten and then had his penis ripped off.) When Ennis and Jack next talk, Ennis declares that he's not queer (Jack says he isn't either). And they're both right. Calling someone queer is a way of saying someone's less of a man and less of a human being because they're attracted to their own sex. Such an assertion is ridiculous, but unfortunately a lot of people still think that way either out of ignorance or insecurity as regards their own sexuality. But Ennis and Jack, whatever their sexual orientation, are just men.And after the two finish on Brokeback Mountain they return to their lives. For Ennis this means getting married (Jack gets married also). But although both have a crack at leading 'normal' lives they can't change how they feel and meet again. And the scene where they're reunited is a powerful one. The two guys meet outside Ennis' place, but seeing as they're out in the open, neither knows how to respond. But when they retreat to a corner where they think no one can see, they're watched by Ennis' wife. For them it's a moment of joy, but for her it's devastating  her world is shattered. And it's to the film's credit that it treats Ennis' wife so evenly. She doesn't become a bitter, vindictive woman, but at the same time she doesn't become a victim. The film never takes the easy way out.But eventually the marriage deteriorates to the point that the couple get divorced (by the end Ennis only sleeps with his wife to procreate). And after that you have an excellent scene where the estranged family have Thanksgiving dinner. It's so awkward because Ennis' ex has a new husband. Everything is bubbling under the surface. And sure enough, in the kitchen, Ennis' ex admits that she knows about his homosexuality and a scuffle ensues.But Jack has his own domestic hell to deal with, too. His father-in-law shows him no respect and interrupts their dinner to put a football game on the television for Jack's son to watch. ""We don't eat with our eyes,"" he says. ""You want your son to grow up to be a man, don't you?"" But Jack asserts himself and shows the stupid old geezer who the real man of the house is.However, as much as the two guys would rather be with each other than their loathsome relatives, they have to make do with monthly 'fishing' trips. Only here do they experience genuine contentment. But eventually even these meetings sour. They just aren't enough. And thusly the relationship between Ennis and Jack eventually falls apart.One of the film's final sequences sees Ennis, after Jack's death (and possible murder), visit Jack's parents. They're a wonderful bunch of scenes, which pick at all the different character's emotions. Mr Twist takes a couple of jabs at Ennis, hinting that Jack had a new 'friend' in a spiteful bid to hurt his guest, while Mrs Twist compassionately lets Ennis take a look around Jack's room. There Ennis finds a couple of shirts which he secretly hugs to his chest, and when he returns downstairs Mrs Twist gives him a bag to keep them in. It's a small act of tolerance and understanding, but one that means a lot for Ennis and the viewer.",Brokeback Mountain
1077,Brokeback Mountain,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1586180/,"I just watched this movie last night for the first time. I wish I hadn't. It was one of the saddest films I have ever seen. It bothered me to no end. I kept waking up all night thinking about it. I feel terrible.The movie hit me especially hard because of my personal experiences. I spent several years living in the West and had a relationship with another man, who has since died. Watching this movie brought back many of the emotions I thought were long buried.I feel like grabbing my coworkers and talking them to death about this film, but I know they don't want to hear about it. I feel this driving need to keep talking about it - maybe if I keep talking about it I can get the ending to change.If I had known how this film was going to affect me - I wouldn't have watched it.

1078,3:10 to Yuma,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1728740/,"Long ago, I saw the original 3:10 to Yuma featuring Van Heflin and Glen Ford, but I don't remember it well enough to compare it with James Mangold's new remake. Instead, my review will focus exclusively on the new film.Mangold's film is a tense, traditional western based on an Elmore Leonard story. Leonard is a solid writer, and gave the material upon which the film is based enough background and characterization to permit willful suspension of disbelief. Mangold's film does the same. Our protagonist and antagonist are, respectively, Dan Evans (Bale) and Ben Wade (Crowe). Evans is a would-be rancher and family-man whose family is suffering from a drought and a merciless landlord. Evans and his boys cross paths with notorious outlaw Ben Wade and his gang on their way into town to confront their landlord, and Wade whimsically lets them go. But the connection between these two men and Dan's eldest son is far from over. Eventually Dan will accept an offer made by a railroad agent to help escort Wade to a train headed to Yuma prison, while Wade's crew of murderers dogs their every step.Two performances stood out for me - Bale and Ben Foster (Charlie Prince). Crowe was good, but it's not clear that he engaged with his role with his usual intensity. There are several very talented actors in supporting roles, and they each pull off the transition to the western genre quite nicely (Alan Tudyk, Logan Lerman, Gretchen Mol, Peter Fonda and others). The film showcases the acting talent very well without losing sight of its straightforward but interesting story.More often than not, good westerns are at least as much character studies as they are 'shoot-em-ups'. After all, it pretty close to impossible to enjoy a film in which anybody might drop dead at any given time without caring about the people you are watching die, or those doing the killing. Mangold achieves this by drawing on the simple strengths of the original material and allowing relationships to dominate both the story's development and the cinematography. For a western, there is a tremendous amount of dialog in this film, coupled with the usual meaningful stares. Wade is so wily and unpredictable that you really never know what to expect out of him, and his crew is headed up by his loyal and equally nihilistic protégé Charlie Prince. Dan Evans is his polar opposite, and Dan's son is an unusually accurate and complex Hollywood portrayal of a teenager. These and other relationships are the strengths and the medium of the film. When the camera isn't being used to build tension before a battle or showing us a gun-fight, it is establishing relationships and character. And many of the characters and relationships we see are surprising, ambiguous and more than a little ironic.Highly recommended for western fans.",3:10 to Yuma
1079,Crash,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1197173/,"I saw this ""movie"" partly because of the sheer number of good reviews at Netflix, and from it I leaned a valuable lesson. Not a lesson about ethnic diversity however...the lesson I learned is ""Don't trust reviews"".Yes, racism sucks and people are complicated, but the people who actually need to see this movie are going to be the ones who are the least drawn to it and least affected by it if they DO see it. The only reason that I can think of for the number of good reviews is that it's being reviewed by people who aren't used to thinking, or who've seen their first thought-provoking movie and somehow think that Haggis invented the concept. In fact, he basically made this film, which should be called ""Racism For Dummies"", as emotionally wrenching as possible, seemingly to give people who don't spend a lot of time thinking the impression that they've discovered some fundamental truth that's never been covered in a film before. Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintanence it's not... An after-school special for the unthinking masses, cut into bite-sized overwrought ham-fisted pieces to make it easier to swallow without too much introspection.It's as if they portrayed everyone as being the worst possible extreme, simply to make us happy that we're such good people because we don't identify with the characters. Let's face it people. NOBODY identifies with these characters because they're all cardboard cutouts and stereotypes (or predictably reverse-stereotypes). It's well acted (even if the dialog is atrocious) and cleverly executed, so much that you don't think to ask ""where's the beef?"" until you can tell the film is winding down. The flaming car scene was well executed, like much of the movie, but went nowhere in the end. The messages are very heavy-handed, and from the ""behind the scenes"" blurb, the producers were clearly watching a different movie, because there is very little to laugh about in this movie, even during the intended funny parts. I have to stress that this is NOT entertainment, more like a high school diversity lesson...call it the ""Blood on the Highway"" of racism. They could even show this in high schools if it weren't for the ""side-nude"" shot of Jennifer Esposito.In this film, everyone's a jerk and everyone learns a lesson (except for Michael Pena who gets the best role, but the most predictable storyline).This is a bad film, with bad writing, and good actors....an ugly cartoon crafted by Paul Haggis for people who can't handle anything but the bold strokes in storytelling....a picture painted with crayons.Crash is a depressing little nothing, that provokes emotion, but teaches you nothing if you already know racism and prejudice are bad things.",Crash

1084,The Machinist,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1520492/,"THE MACHINIST (Brad Anderson - Spain 2004).Christian Bale is Trevor Reznik, a machinist in an anonymous factory somewhere in America. He is obviously scarred by some past incident but what is it? He finds mysterious notes on his refrigerator, saying 'who are you?' He sees colleagues that don't exist. He seems to have lost it completely.A Spanish production, but with Brad Anderson at the helm as director and an almost exclusively American cast, this is basically an American film. I must admit, I kept shelving this one, due to reasons I cannot really recall now I've finally watched it, but it probably had something to do with Christian Bale's insane weight loss and all the surrounding publicity. I assumed the film was all about Bale's loss of weight and not much more. A method boy in a film solely hyped for an actor's dedication to play the part, but the film blew me away, as simple as that. Christian Bale gives a solo turn here almost unseen before. No matter how many pounds he lost, it's a remarkable performance. Director Brad Anderson succeeds brilliantly in conceiving an atmosphere that is so compelling, as one other user on the IMDb stated, 'You just HAVE to know what the hell is going on here.' I think that's the key factor in what makes this film so incredibly compelling. The whole setting is an anonymous industrial town somewhere in the US, that could be Pennsylvania, Michigan or upstate New York (actually, it was shot near Barcelona), but it doesn't really matter where the story is located. It's the atmosphere of estrangement that does it. And Christian Bale gives such an intense performance you really want to know his cause and background. Where on earth does he come from? We know he works in a greasy factory, but why is he skin-over-bone? Why hasn't he slept in over a year? Brad Anderson creates an atmosphere so broody and sleazy, it's like a netherworld, an urban nightmare. In a certain way it reminded me of the strange urban landscape in ""Eraserhead"" by David Lynch.Camera Obscura --- 9/10",The Machinist

1086,Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1219455/,"The movie ran as if it were a series of highlight clips from an actual film representation of the fourth harry potter novel. Details were thrown in haphazardly, if for no other reason than to bring a feeling of recognition from readers. If the viewer had not read the book, but only seen the previous two movies, s/he would not have understood the movie. The screenwriters created no semblance complicated plot, but rather the rather single-minded story of the three tasks in the tri-wizard tournament. All new characters were hardly introduced and remained quite one-dimensional, which is unfortunate; even old favorites got the shaft in this one. There was no time for more than two short scenes with either Malfoy, no magical lessons, and Dobby the house elf was completely absent. Crouch never disappeared, but his body was found dead. The cinematics in this case were atrocious: Harry appears in Dumbledore's chambers in the scene immediately after discovering Crouch's body, but then proceeds to tell him about his scar hurting and dreams rather than Crouch's discovery. There was no magical map, no late-night encounters with Moody, no discussion of Snape and Karkaroff's relationship, nor of Dumbledore trusting Snape. Seeing as this relationship will rise to be the single most prominent issue in the entire series, I was very disappointed to find it was ignored in favor of large and ineffective theatrics, such as a hedge maze without any traps, only shifting walls and evil roots, an extremely obnoxious modernized yule ball, and a pointlessly drawn out dragon chase scene. Dumbledore's lines and the directing of his acting made him look like an old, bumbling fool, rather than the clever, most-powerful-wizard on the planet, the only person of whom Voldemort is afraid. The writers decided to add Crouch Jr. into Harry's dreams, completely removed the second house-elf and the invisibility cloak from the quidditch world cup, and had the audacity to explain that Crouch Jr. had been sent to Azkaban, but never explained his escape. Finally, the movie ended with Crouch Jr. being sent back to Azkaban. The Minister of Magic never showed up with dementors to kill Crouch, Dumbledore never argued with him about the verity of Harry's claims, and the potential for an amazing cliff-hanger conclusion with Dumbledore in all his might giving orders to Hagrid and others as a general before the final battle, was instead replaced by a horrible attempt at a eulogy combining direct quotations from the novel with poor scriptwriting to make Dumbledore out to be a poor speaker as well as incompetent wizard. I shudder to think how the next movie will have to deal with all of these plot gaps, and how Dumbledore can hope to maintain any semblance of respectability when he trusts Snape and continues to avoid Harry in the fifth movie. Much better would have been to stick with the original idea and make two movies. This movie didn't feel like it had any plot, one did not become attached to the characters, and spent the movie groaning or laughing at the contrived immaturity of it all. Some acting by Harry and friends was good, but it was overshadowed by a terrible attempt to fit everything and nothing into the movie.","Unknown.

1087,Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1219201/,"Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - Harry (Dan Radcliffe) enters his fourth year of Hogwarts and is entered into the incredibly dangerous Triwizard tournament by an anonymous stranger. All hail to Mike Newell, the director of this masterpiece! The movie forgoes the happiness and frivolity of the previous movies and replaces it with teen problems (done very funnily of course), epic action sequences and hilarious British humor.Coming back to the show are the fantastic three. Dan has come into his own. He is Harry. He is vulnerable, angry, not always sure what to do, and has actually gotten quite good at comedy routines. Rupert Grint is not just used for comedic relief this time. He gets jealous of Harry for getting into the tournament, and is tired of being referred to as ""Harry Potter's Stupid Friend"". Emma Watson is beautiful and plays the supporter of Harry largely, but does it well. The other children are a blast to watch, especially Neville and Fred and George. I liked how more attention came to the character of Cedric Diggory, and his brief relationship to Harry.The adult actors are sparingly but well used. Alan Rickman only has two main scenes (He probably did about one day of filming) but it's just enough. Maggie Smith is equally funny and Micheal Gambon is used more than in the previous film. He thankfully has one fatherly scene in this film, which was lacking in PoA. Brendan Gleeson is hilariously over-the-top as ""Mad-Eye"", a vicious old dark wizard catcher assigned to be the new Dark Arts teacher.The humor has grown more adult, which fits the growing audience better. Sexuality and Excellent Writing replace most of the repetition gags and silly physical humor of Columbus and Cuaron. This fits J.K. Rowling's style much better actually. It's all very funny and very British, as it should be. As for the teen problems? Getting a date for the dance, and learning to dance. Dealing with rejection and hormones. We've all been there. It's all very real and well done. These kids feel like real people, not mythical elves or gods.The movie is close to 3 hours, but chances are you'll spend most of it either laughing or terrified. Harry's round with the dragon is intensely scary but amazing. His second task, slightly less so, but the dragon was a tough act to follow. The maze is scary, easily a villain by itself. Think ""The Shining"" on crack. The finale will leave pretty much anyone with a soul breathless and crying. Ralph Fiennes is terrifying as Voldemort. Dark times indeed.Not for anyone who hasn't seen the other movies or read the books (or doesn't want to because it's not ""cool""), but who gives a crap about them? Not for kids under 12 (they'll go to see it anyway, I've seen 7 year olds read the 6th book), but this stuff is scary for anyone. Diehards who want every side-plot of the book included will be disappointed. C'mon guys, the movie's almost 3 hours anyway (Though I was genuinely disappointed at the lack of further exposition about Neville Longbottom)! The movie does the best at being comprehensible without aid of reference from the books of it's predecessors, and is a genuinely exceptional comedy/thriller, and feels epic and yet real. And that's a tall order to deliver for a story about magic and a wizard. Mike Newell is a god truly.Not for the faint of heart, this gets an A",Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire
1088,Man on Fire,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1493153/,"A riveting introduction, powerful performances and yet, I couldn't quite connect. The trendy editing, I hope, it's just a moronic phase that movies are going through to be outgrow soon, very soon. All the dramatic tension vanishes as the editor plays around with the visuals. Why? If you have characters played by the likes of Denzel Washington, why the need to hit us over the head with a self conscious blow of irrational cutting taking me out of the movie completely and forcing me to see the movie as a movie, the actors as actors and the drama as sheer fiction. Washington is superb. Slowly but surely I'm warming up to the man. I've always admired his performances but there was something about the actor, a veil of arrogance perhaps, that stopped me from getting closer. Here, his personal torment and his warming up to Dakota Fanning took me completely until the smart ass editing ruined everything.",N/A
1089,Man on Fire,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0991858/,"Certainly one of the finest movies I have seen for quite some time. Exquisite direction and flawless acting make this a very entertaining and often moving film. Denzel Washington plays one of his most engaging and emotional roles to date, and the rest of the cast perform beautifully. Christopher Walken is of course superb in his part although he did not appear as often as I would have liked. A story of ultimate greed that backfires is offset against a childs innocence and love. This is also a film for action movie lovers as it has its fair share of bullets, rockets and revenge. The location of Mexico City adds a feel of seediness and corruption which in itself is an eye opener. All in all, a truly gripping film from beginning to end. Highly recommended!",N/A
1090,Coraline,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3368638/,"This review is so important that I wanted to watch the film three or four times with a pause in between... so here we are 6 years after the release.And I can tell you that this is not merely a ""10"" but one of the best films of all time.In the Olympics they only give 10s to ""perfect"" performances. After four viewings, I can see this film is flawless. The story never gets dull or predictable. Every child can relate to the ""grass is always greener"" syndrome and every adult can relate to being a child. The dialog is so sharp it hurts. The voice actors are astounding. The animation is the best I have ever seen next to Little Price and that comparison is not fair but that specific film did not exist in 2009. (It was released in 2015).I loved the cat. This could be the only film in history that not only has a cat co-star but the cat always acts ... like a cat.I will see this film several more times in the years ahead. That is a promise.Watch it because it is fun. Watch it to be entertained. Watch it to see what perfection looks like.",N/A
1091,Coraline,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2262462/,"I am eleven years old and I absolutely loved this movie. Every bit of it was fantastic. I read the book before I watched the movie and was quite satisfied. I, for one did not have any nightmares of such. I think adults are completely overestimating what children can't handle. This was a fine movie. But maybe some of the elements weren't appropriate for younger viewers, like when Miss Spink and Forcible were performing in the other world. I may be different then other children because I can tolerate more scary elements. This was creepy and very original. I loved how twisted and strange it was. The movie was very good and I do suggest some of you actually allow yourselves to enjoy it without criticizing the moment you see something that seems inappropriate. I am a huge Neil Gaiman fan and trust me if I can endure The Lost Boys, I am pretty sure I can endure this. Parents, stop being overprotective and allow yourself to see the good things.",N/A
1092,The Last Samurai,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1075185/,"I am a Japanese. In this movie I see many false misunderstandings and errors on Japanese culture. For example, they try to overlap Samurais and Native Americans, which is very difficult for Japanese to comprehend. In one scene, Samurais were fighting in a jungle. We do not have a jungle in Japan. They try to depict that swords are the most important thing for samurais, which is not true at all. Bushido is not that shallow.The only notable thing I observed in this movie is that the Hollywood finally learned to be capable of treating foreign cultures positively. I know it is very difficult to make a movie about foreign cultures free from misunderstandings and prejudice.If you want to touch the real Bushido, which Japanese natives embrace, I recommend that you read ""Bushido"" written by Nitobe Inazo, or watch ""Chushingura"".",N/A
1093,The Last Samurai,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1085007/,"After my third viewing, I can finally admit that this film has me. I enjoyed it during its theatrical run, enjoyed it more the second time around, and now, I can only say that I love it. The cast is exemplary. Tom Cruise is so good in this film that it is very often easy to forget he is Tom Cruise. Easily his most powerful role and best performance since Jerry Maguire. Ken Watanabe, however, is incredible in every scene - acting with a rare sensitivity and intensity and breathing life into a character much larger and more human than the grand story of which he is a part. Though the entire cast is excellent, I feel that I must also single out Koyuki and Shichinosuke Nakamura for, respectively, the female lead and the emperor, for the subtle strength and believability they each give their very challenging roles.The story takes place during the early modernization of Japan, in the 1870s and 1880s. The Emperor's power has been weakened by the political and economic power of his cabinet, by his young age, and by the political influence of the United States and other western powers pulling the strings of his cabinet and supplying modern weaponry and tactics to the modernizing Japanese army. Cruise plays Captain Allgren, an alcoholic veteran who has seen and participated in too many massacres of innocent people, and is offered an opportunity to reclaim some of his honor by helping to train the Japanese military in the use of firearms. When he arrives in Japan, we learn that the first test of the Japanese army and its new weapons will be against a rebellious group of samurai who believe themselves to be in the service of the Emperor and Japan, but resist the Emperor's cabinet and the influence of western nations. In the power void left by a passive emperor, Japan seems poised to enter into a civil war against its own values, faith and honor. During the first attack on the Samurai, Allgren is captured by the Samurai and begins a spiritual, physical and philosophical journey which will bring him a level of self-respect his own culture could never supply.My interpretation of this journey is that Allgren has found a place and people that offer him redemption, where, in his own world, he can find none. But Allgren's is only a small part of the story - which ultimately revolves around what is right for Japan, for the subjectivity of a whole nation, and how to portray such a subject from its own perspective. Traditional Japan is treated with empathy here, not aggrandizing exaggeration, as some of the film's critics seem to suggest. This is not a film about what is objectively right and wrong, but a film about struggling to understand and empower tradition as a means to control and benefit from change. I find no grand moral statement here, but rather an intense, sympathetic, human drama with a strong sense of honor and sacrifice.Edward Zwick has made a film which operates well at every level, carrying simple but profound philosophical ideas, but avoiding the mistake of making these ideas and the characters that express them super-heroic. Ultimately, this beautifully shot film conveys powerful messages about war, tradition, ethics, honor and culture, which, though not particularly original, are sensitively and intelligently brought forward. There is a lot of action, including some remarkably well-acted sword fighting and martial artistry, but none of it seems unnecessary and the whole film is truly tightly woven. My highest recommendation.",The Last Samurai
1094,The Magdalene Sisters,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1180469/,"I would give this film 20 out of 10! Excellent acting, nimble direction and very well crafted representations of real-historical events and persons. Eileen Walsh should get a special award for an incredible performance as Crispina - Eileen, you are fantastic! I look forward to more from you! What shook me was the realization that this movie captured the interplay of Dickensian exploitation interwoven with the fascistic barbarity of the church. The laundry was a slave-plantation par excellence as it ground its physically, sexually and emotionally exploited slaves within an atmosphere of sheer terror and self-hatred - we deserve what we get because we are guilty - shame on us - this is what the masters of every plantation on this planet sought to instill in slaves. What I would have liked to see developed further was how this laundry-plantation fit within the wider Irish society - whose clothes were being washed, and what was their relationship to the people who were incarcerated here? Religion's role in the sheer brutalization of its adherents has been evidenced throughout history - no mass religion has brought anything other than terror, subjugation and self-hatred to women - this film proves it beyond doubt! As men, we are beneficiaries of such brutalities to women - and we are like Margaret's brother - who sheepishly mutters some nonsense about waiting to grow up while his sister lived in hell. What pained me most in this film was the terrible scene of uniformed men dragging Crispina out of the dormitory - to her destruction - and here the most painful part was noting that none of the women could shake off their terror to help their sister who cried for help. The scene captured in a brutal moment, the truth that tyranny can only thrive with our collective fear. Religion like other totalitarian ideologies rules by internalized terror. Enough, go on and watch this movie, its worth every tear you shed, because in the end, you will find that being disturbed makes you recognize the suffering of every Crispina, Margaret, Rose, Bernadette among us.",N/A
1095,Good Bye Lenin!,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0993211/,"This was a good film, and I think it needed to be made. A way of life disappeared in Europe, perhaps forever, and it seems appropriate that the fall of Communism has thus been documented.The basic premise of ""Goodbye Lenin"" is that the young man's mother is in a coma over the months when the Berlin Wall is coming down. She wakes up (oblivious) in united Germany, but as she is so fragile she cannot be allowed to know that everything she held dear has collapsed. What ensues is a comic and moving scenario - her son does his best to pretend that nothing has changed.Yes, the movie is a little drawn-out. And most of the comedy is lost on non-Germans, or those unaware of the political climate in the region. However, there are clear universal issues to be considered; idealism, hope, family. There is one particular scene which I thought encompassed exactly how the main protagonist feels - he is at a bank trying to change his mother's old East German currency into Deutschmarks but the deadline has passed. He becomes aggravated by the sheep-like behaviour of his peers. After all, this is their culture being crushed by McCapitalism, but their individual vaunting ambition blinds them from doing something about it. Very refreshing to see this on the big screen.All in all, ""Goodbye Lenin"" is a nicely-rounded statement of where the European film industry is heading, and it will appeal to most independent-minded people on both an artistic and political level. 8/10.",Goodbye Lenin
1096,In America,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1492220/,"This was simply a nice human-interest story with some mumbo-jumbo voodoo stuff thrown in because filmmakers like that sort of thing.Basically, it's about a nice Irish family which immigrates to the United States and resides in New York. These are poor people, but not the destitute situation of, let's say, the McCourt family from ""Angela's Ashes.""What stood out to me were the nice, cute little girls in this family, played by real- life sisters, Emma and Sarah Bolger. They were the kind of sweet kids you wish you'd see more of in modern films. Paddy Considine and Samantha Morton played the parents, ""Johnny and Sarah"" nicely and Djimon Hounson played the nice neighbor with the strange powers.

1097,In America,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0840527/,"Two of the reasons for going to see this film are: Emma and Christy Bolger. They steal the movie from under more established stars. They make us see their new world through their eyes. It is magic to them to be in a new city, where they discover new things every day. They are disarming.
America, the land that receives so many immigrants can be a hostile environment for a lot of people. For Johnny and Sarah, New York is a place full of surprises, as it must be to a lot of people whose dream is to make it there. This film is about their struggle to survive in pursuing a dream that turns out to be a nightmare for them, in many respects.
Paddy Considine and Samantha Morton make the struggling Irish immigrants very real under the direction of Jim Sheridan, who is supposed to be the Johnny of the story. What they have to deal with in their new home, eventually make them conquer a world that's not kind to them. Nothing is given to them on a silver platter, which is the case with most illegal people in the country, so their tale is very believable and true to the pioneer spirit they have within themselves.It is the fantastic performance of the two Bolger sisters, as the daughters, which brings this film into focus. They have their feet on the ground and they know the ordeal their parents are facing. Their luminous faces and natural endear them to us in a special way.

1098,I Am Sam,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0793178/,"I wanted to like this movie- ( I have a brother who is mentally handicapped) but after watching it I felt it had tried to hard to manipulate my emotions in such an obvious way. First, Sam (Sean Penn) is surrounded by his inner circle of friends who are also mentally handicapped and who come across much more believable, probably because they are in real life. So Sean Penn's character 'Sam' stands out against his group of friends like a fish out of water, trying to get in every speech and facial nuance that says 'hello I'm retarded'. (Much like Nic Cage's depiction of O.C.D.'s in Matchstick Men) Sam's daughter Lucy is a cute little girl, it's hard not to like her. But she's just a little too 'Hollywood cute'. Michelle Pheiffer over-acts, first as her 'I am a beautiful female lawyer who has what it takes to win a case' to the understanding sensitive pro-bono attorney who makes Sam's case (to regain custody of Lucy) her exclusive campaign, all the while having to constantly push her hair out of her face in order to impart the facts of family court to Sam.By the end of the film, Sam seems to have gotten smarter, his verbal skills are quicker and it seems his thinking is faster. And his lawyer has predictably learned a lot of life lessons from helping Sam.
Did anyone else think he 'borrowed' the exact same clothing from Dustin Hoffman's character Raymond in Rainman? Is is an unspoken rule that all mentally handicap men must dress in khaki jackets and pants that are 2 inches to short with white socks?",N/A

Penn is highly under rated in the world that is movies, as he shows with this Oscar potential performance.The young actress who plays his daughter is amazingly mature in her acting, whilst always managing to capture the innocence of her youthfullness.

1100,Adaptation.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0778217/,"Following his success as screenwriter for 'Being John Malcovich', Charlie Kaufman is given the job of adapting Susan Orlean's book 'The Orchid Thief' which she expanded from a piece in The New Yorker that she wrote on the obsessive orchid hunter John Laroche. While Charlie struggles to adapt the book into a workable film, his twin brother, Donald, writes a successful script around serial killers. The more Charlie struggles to get a story from the book the more the stories and his life start to intertwine.I wanted to see this film because I had enjoyed BJM and was interested to see what Jonze did next. I came to it with a vague knowledge of the plot but nowhere near enough o have expectations. For the majority of the film, the different style and presentation kept me deeply interested. The way the different stories occurred in different times and places worked a lot better than I would have expected it to. The plot gets increasingly difficult to follow and you'll get as much as you want from it. For those just looking for a simple story then you'll have a nice neat resolution, if you want more then more is there for you as you try to work out what part of the film is real and what part isn't.I came away with mixed feelings. I felt that the ending was not as clever as it thought it was and didn't give a good ending for those who weren't happy to accept things at face value. I didn't feel let down I just felt that the last section of the film stepped down a gear rather than up. I know that this is the point that Jonze was making perhaps, by allowing Donald's derided ending come to live and be the replacement for Charlie's original aim. But it didn't totally do it for me. Up till this section I was hooked and felt that the various stories all worked to form a mix of drama and comedy. However the end does a disservice to it's characters.Cage shows that the recent cr*p he has been in doesn't mean he can't act (just that he doesn't). He really brings his two characters to life and plays them so well that it is easy to forget that it is the same person in both roles. Cooper is wonderful and deserved his Oscar for support. Streep, as much as I dislike her, was very good and brought that difficult character out  although I did feel she was the one most betrayed by the film's end.Overall this was an interesting film that worked in most areas. It's difference and it's inventiveness were such that I wanted to keep watching. However I, and I know others will disagree, felt that this uniqueness was not well served by the end of the film. I understand that it was not meant to exist in the same way as the majority of the film but I still felt that the ending didn't meet the standard set by the rest of the film.",Adaptation
1101,Black Hawk Down,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1904593/,"I have seen many War movies and I am myself a very die hard Military Technology Enthusiast but I have hardly seen any movie which is as correct as this one. This movie simply gives you the feel of the actual action which went on during this battle. Everything from the way the soldiers moved, took their position, fired from covered positions, gave covering fire to each other, the use of Explosives including grenade and the way they captured strategic places even without much help from Air Force gave a true and absolutely realistic view of Real Time Urban Combat. It shows that Humvees are not impenetrable and the Soldier manning the machine gun post is extremely vulnerable from Roof Top Fire. Again the way Small Arms like the LMG & UMG were used were impressive and the tactics used by Special Forces to fend off attackers and secure the perimeter was true to all my knowledge. I appreciate the Director and actors to carry out this War Movie with such accuracy. If you are a Defence Enthusist this movie is must watch and if not then too one must watch it to understand is WAR is nothing less then HELL.

There wasn't enough action to be an action film, there's not enough surprises to be a suspense film, and not characterization to care about the characters - particularly Michael Junior. All the tender moments with piano seemed like someone was trying to emulate Frank Darabond a bit too much. I guess I just sensed a profound lack of depth - nothing provoked any thoughts for me.

If we lived in Elizabethan days, I'd say this movie's a bit like a Shakespearean tragedy. But since we don't, let's say it's more like a Drama-Suspense movie.The plot is simple, but the story is complex. The movie is intelligent in the way relationships and issues are explored. Much of the story is shown rather than told, which I find makes it more subtle and moving - and which also works well for a story based on a comic book (or graphic novel). At times I felt I was actually there in the 1930s, part of this story - there was such a realistic yet dream-like quality in the style of its telling.I don't often prefer movies to the books they were based upon, but in this case I do. (Though I did enjoy the book too.) I've bought the DVD, which is great because it has some wonderful deleted scenes and insightful commentary.(I also took my little cousin, who's a little younger than the boy in the movie, to see it after I saw it for the first time, because he has issues at home and I wanted to use this as a way of starting a discussion on father-son issues with him.

1104,The Experiment,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1348002/,"This German film is a great piece of psychological horror. Based on the real life Stanford Prison Experiment from 1971, the basic storyline revolves around a group of twenty male volunteers who role-play prison life (twelve guards and eight prisoners). The prisoners have simple rules to follow and the guard's job is to enforce them but without violence. It is, after all, a research project to study human behavior. At first, both the guards and prisoners take it as simply a game but as it goes on, things get drastically out of hand. When certain prisoners don't follow a basic command or joke around too much, the guards are forced to come up with punishments. Some people just can't handle authority though. The days go by, sadistic humiliation and violence ensues, and eventually, all control is lost. Das Experiment explores human nature with disturbing results. The movie is well made, despite a few weak plot points, and has fine acting from the leads. One final thing I would like to praise is how well claustrophobic tension is captured in some scenes of Das Experiment (such as with the gagged man tied to a chair and the black isolation box)I could really feel the distress and helplessness of the victims.",Das Experiment
1105,The Experiment,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0969657/,This was a surprisingly intense film that I'm so glad I watched. The concept was great and this was even before I found out it was based on a true story. But once I heard that it makes me want to look into it a lot more and see what differed from actual life and such. Supposedly the movie was pretty accurate though. It's amazing that good foreign films blow the socks off of most Hollywood garbage any day of the week. They're more realistic and the characters act more like real people would in day to day situations. The love story in this might've been the only thing that I think could've been done better since it became a little weird here and there. Other than that the suspense kept me going and the thought that this could happen to anyone is really scary to ponder. I'm pretty sure I'd like to see this made into an American version only because I'm quite positive they'd butcher it and wouldn't contain anything near the desired effect as has usually been the case in the past. It was kept simple and because of that...it worked!

Compared to other pictures shot in the Eighties and showing English plights of those years, this melodrama is better conceived and more engrossing for the way it tells of family life and dreams coming true.

1107,Hedwig and the Angry Inch,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0737103/,"This is an *amazing* movie.  Quite simply amazing.I'm a total music geek, I can find faults with almost any music you throw my way.  My favorite rock operas include Genesis' ""The Lamb Lies Down on Broadway,"" Kevin Gilbert's ""The Shaming of the True""...  And the newest addition to the list -- ""Hedwig and the Angry Inch.""That's right, you heard right, I'm calling it a rock opera.  This quite simply ain't no musical.  And 2 minutes into this, before they were done with the first song, I already knew I had to get a copy of the soundtrack. And I did the next day.I've also gotten a hold of the original cast recording, and there's an album of covers of the songs by various 3d party artists called ""Wig in a Box"" that I've also gotten and I've been listening to all three obsessively.There's just something *about* watching a tall and fairly good looking transsexual with hairy armpits and quite possibly the worst blond wig I've ever seen sing some amazingly good 70's style arena glam rock...  In the middle of a divey restaurant, with a bunch of old, balding people who look like they belong in a Florida retirement community trying really hard to ignore the music, complaining to their waitress and then finally standing up to leave...In one scene, the band is almost entirely hidden behind the restaurant's salad bar.But none of this manages to tear Hedwig down -- the amazing quality of the music, the performance...  Does not at any point suffer from the attitude of the unreceptive listeners.  Almost as if she *knows* that the viewers at home are loving it...  So WHO CARES about the more immediate audience.And the story?  This story is inspirational, thoughtful, sensitive, beautiful...  Aside from the fact that it's very, very strange and prides itself on being so.  Even if there isn't an element of the gender bending lifestyle in your life...  As long as you have reasonably good taste in music -- as long as your immediate response to the question ""Ziggy played... what?"" is something like ""Guitar, of course!  And gosh, was that ever a good song!"" -- you will enjoy this movie.And if there *is* an element of gender bending to your lifestyle...  This is practically a must watch.",Hedwig and the Angry Inch

There's nothing truly outstanding about any one aspect of the movie; nothing that will blow you away. However, everything is put together perfectly.Personally, I have a theory that any movie that absolutely blows you away the first time you see it, will lose its entertainment value very quickly. Not necessarily because the movie was not good, but because it just seems to get old too fast. This is NOT one of those movies.This is the kind of movie that will be enjoyed countless times. The dialogue is slick, and always to the point. There are few (if any) overdone scenes and/or lines that tend to become annoying over time.This movie flows exceptionally well. Personally, I couldn't quite figure out why until I watched the ""behind the scenes"" footage on the DVD. I didn't really notice all of the work they put into using as few shots as possible. The extra features on the DVD really explain it all. Almost every scene uses considerably less shots than you would think it takes to convey all of the activity going on.

1110,"O Brother, Where Art Thou?",https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0638635/,"I have walked out of a Coen movie before and not quite known how to feel. The two best examples of that are The Big Lebowski and Fargo. Lebowski was so ridiculously original and so filled with strange humour that I had to like it. On the other hand, there were some unnecessary reveries with flying people and killer bowling balls that just didn't seem to fit the mold of the film. Still, I liked the film and now own a copy of it. Fargo made me howl with hysterics, sometimes I wasn't sure why I was laughing so hard that it made me cry, but nonetheless I was. There were many seemingly strange characters in Fargo, but upon further investigation, they were really just real people talking about real situations. That is why the man with the shovel ( or was it a broom ) was so side-splittingly funny when he was telling the police officer about some funny looking man down at the bar the other night. And that is also why the theater erupted in laughter when he then says that there are some funny looking clouds coming in. (I own a copy of this film too) The Coen's have a way of masking their film and their characters as being somewhat eccentric and perhaps a little off the wall. But if you look closer at some of those same characters that seem zany, you will always find that in some strange way, they all ring true. That is what is quite exceptional about O Brother Where Art Thou? This is a film that is out there. I mean it is not even in the same ballpark as a traditional film. I reviewed the film Shaft this past summer and in it I said that Shaft was an okay film that I have seen a thousand times before. But you can not say that about a Coen Brother's film and you most certainly can not say that about this one.This film has everything in it from a jail break, crooked southern politicians, muses, references to what I can only assume are historical figures, riverside baptisms, bank robberies, violence towards animals, singing flocks of religious fanatics, KKK, lynch mobs and so on. There are obviously many references to Homer's Odyssey in here as well, but I wouldn't know that because I have never read Homer's Odyssey or even knew one thing about it. Every other newspaper reviewer seems to know all about it and they think that this cynicism and almost spoof-like quality towards it makes the film that much better. Well coming from a guy who doesn't know anything about it, I can tell you that it is still an entertaining film. There were times when again, as is usual for a Coen film, I wasn't sure why I was entertained or laughing, but I was.This is a road picture where three men travel along the way to find a hidden treasure that Clooney says he has hidden to his two other cell mates. He has to take them along because they were also chained to him when they had their chance to escape.I like all the principal actors in the film and many of them are Coen cronies. It was nice to see Goodman again. It was nice to see Hunter and especially Turturro who seems to have a place in every Coen film. It's too bad they didn't find a place for Steve Buscemi but that is a different story all together. But back to Clooney. The man just has charisma. He is a one hell of an actor as well and here he is not quite as zany as the others but even he has his own idiosyncrasies. His work here is quite awesome and I really hope this shows that he is capable of playing any range of character.Now after heaping all this praise on the film, let me just say this as well. I didn't really enjoy the film at first. I found it to be quite tedious and a little boring. There were too many ideas in here and not enough care went into harnessing them for all what they were worth. But then the film began to grow on me. It took a while but it did grow on me. I don't think this is their best film, but it is still a good one and I am giving it a 8.5. But the reason that I do recommend this film is for one reason only.Every day you can go look into the paper and look at the films that are playing and say to yourself, seen it, seen it, oh, seen it last year, that is the same as this film and that is the same as that film. Most films have been recycled in some form or another. Not the Coen's films. They have not been recycled and if they have I don't know about it. That is reason enough to see something that they put out. Originality counts for a lot in my books. The Coens are original and they are good. And that is not common in todays cinema. Enjoy them while they are allowed to make films. Because you don't get vision like this in many films, so when you do, enjoy it!","O Brother, Where Art Thou?"
1111,"O Brother, Where Art Thou?",https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0639194/,"We lived through the depression and related to some of the conditions portrayed. We have watched it perhaps a dozen times. Each time we see it we pick up on something we had missed because we were still laughing at, or discussing, an earlier scene or line. The entire film was a collection of photographically great faces. We are still asking ourselves whether the entire cast were professionals or whether some were individuals found on location. The film was rich with subtle tie-ins like the children tied together with twine, as the prisoners were connected by chains. We still think the cow may have been hit unintentionally. Fords of that era had mechanical brakes. The driver of the car may not have been accustomed the longer stopping distances required. The many allusions to Ulysses Odyssey inspired us to do an inter-net search. We found a modern text version and discovered more sly references. We appreciate blue grass and country music as originally American and found it thoroughly enjoyable, along with the authentic ""Go To Sleep Little Baby"" and ""Down from the Mountain."" We were emotionally touched by this film because of our age, and find it totally entertaining every time we view it. We are still amazed that someone not of our generation could have captured the essence of that period of United States history.",N/A

He wrote and produced those. Here he does triple duty as creator/writer, producer, and director. I like 'different' movies, where the story travels 'out of the box.' I found this one totally entertaining, and we even get 'Marty' and 'Doc Brown'! :-) James Marsden is Neal Oliver, a young man who enjoys art, and is good at it. But his overbearing father wants his son to attend a prestigious law school and eventually join him in his law practice. Confused about what he should do, and frustrated, he makes a wish and encounters red-haired O.W. Grant (or, grant one wish) played smartly and energetically by Gary Oldman. This O.W is a strange fellow, seemingly knowing everything about Neal, and convinces him to take a road trip heading west along fictional Interstate 60. The characters even acknowledge that there is no I-60, but Neal goes anyway, with O.W. in the passenger seat. Along I-60 they encounter some very interesting towns and people. One town is where most residents are lawyers and visitors are charged with a crime that everyone knows is bogus, but they all go along with it as a way of keeping lawyers gainfully employed. Neal finds an interesting way out of his dilemma.Christopher Lloyd and Kurt Russell have small by interesting parts. Amy Smart is Nancy, the girl that Neal keeps seeing on billboards, but no one else can see them (except O.W.). Neal is puzzled, but hopes she is the person he is supposed to deliver a package to.

Neal and Nancy finally meet up, they hit it off, Neal stands up to his father, and wins an art contest with a drawing he made while traveling I-60 (the viewer's proof that it wasn't just a dream.)",N/A
1113,"South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut",https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0558529/,"In the quiet little town of South Park Stan, Kyle, Cartman and Kenny bride a tramp to sneak them into an R screening of the new Terrance & Phillip movie. They emerge foul mouthed and with attitude as a result of the movie and, while repeating a stunt in the film, Kenny is killed and sent to Hell. Kyle's mother leads a movement against the Canadian comedians that results in their arrest and sentencing to death.  Meanwhile in Hell, Satan and his lover Saddam Hussain prepare for the killing of Terrance & Phillip  the sign of the coming of the new time where Satan will rise again to rule the earth.  Can Stan, Kyle, Cartman and Kenny save the comedians, stop the censorship movement that blames society for bad behaviour and prevent Satan and Saddam from destroying the world?I suspect those that hate this movie are generally those who hate the TV show, where those who liked it may not be those who watch the show.  I'm a fan of the show but I not such a fan that I blind to the lack of consistency at times in the show  some episodes are dumb and lack wit, trading on swear words and forced jokes.  However I fell in love with this movie from my first time seeing it.  The film is funny in the same sort of silly juvenile way that the series is.  It has the same strange sense of humour  witness Conan O'Brien having a `Judas' moment and throwing himself to his death!However on top on this it is imaginative.  How many other crude films would do it as a musical.  I'm not saying that this makes it more worthy than gross out comedies like American Pie etc, but it is cleverer.  The musical element adds to the film and helps it's stretched running time.  The songs are all catchy and are better than some of Lloyd-Webber's stuff!  They are choreographed well and just feel funnier due to the situation and the lyrics!  For example Satan's song `Up there' is excellent but hilarious because of who's singing it and the sentiments he's expressing!The irony of the film is not lost.  The accusations levelled at the South Park Movie are those that the mothers in the film level at Terrance & Phillip.  The story actually answers it's own critics while telling the story!  It's not perfect and it does go a bit over the top and maybe begins to think that it is cleverer than it actually is.The voice work is as excellent as always and Parker and Stone carry this the whole way home.  Guest stars add some interest but really all I need is Cartman et al and I'm set!Overall I am a South park fan and I really enjoyed this.  Not just because of the elements of the show that are reproduced here but also how clever it feels (even if it isn't always as smart as it wants to be).  This isn't a cheap TV spin off into a movie this is a film that is imaginative and funny. Haters of the show will hate this but this may win you over if you thought the TV show was juvenile and a waste of time.","Southpark: Bigger, Longer & Uncut"

I was thrilled for the first, say, 105 minutes of Training Day.  Then, rather than giving us a shocking ending, which would have been ok, or an ambiguous ending, which would have been better, we are given a cheesy formulaic ending.  Not only that, the last 15 minutes are an assault on the viewer's intelligence. We are required to believe that Hawke's character would give up his weapon, we are hit with a ridiculous coincidence with the wallet, and it is suggested that our hero would know how to use LA's bus system to travel (quickly, another joke) from Boyle Heights to South Central (for those of you not from here, that would not happen).  Then Washington's character leaves Hawke's alive, and...oh forget it, the list just keeps going.But up until that point, I was so impressed.  Hawke's internal struggle was great to watch, and pretty plausible.  Washington, awful as his character was, was a joy to watch.  It was fairly reflective of local issues, coming on the heels of the Rampart police scandal, in which cops in one part of the city (where most of the movie was set) took over the streets, making a huge impact in crime while doing some terrible things.  The action scenes (until the latter moments) were fairly realistic looking and fun to watch.  The character actors in smaller roles (Macy Gray, Snoop Dogg, and especially Cliff Curtis and his friends) were outstanding.  You know, this movie had everything I would have wanted, except for an ending that didn't p*** me off.Go see this movie, but once it moves to the bathtub, feel free to stop.",Training Day

Wes Anderson is one filmmaker who can. His characters are so richly drawn, finely acted and beautifully directed, that even when they're not speaking... we can read their emotions, we feel their pain. Young Jason Swartzman gives a fantastic performance.  Even nicer is the surprise turn by Bill Murray, who manages to play a good guy and a villain at the same time. In one scene he  is wearing Budweiser boxer shorts on a diving board. He is smoking a cigarette and jumps, doing a cannonball into his sewer-ridden pool. We see him curled up at the bottom of his pool, drowning himself in misery. Is this a connection to his future lover's dead husband? Who knows. But what we do know is that Anderson has crafted his film to star the most unlikely of heroes. They are the oddest of the bunch, but at the same time we know what they are going through. Their oddness aside, what we learn to see more of, is their hearts. It is obvious Anderson has wiped his heart all over this piece, and it pays off more than I'm sure he ever could have imagined.",N/A
1119,Open Your Eyes,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1229954/,"I recently watched Abre Los Ojos. That prompted me to then rent Vanilla Sky. I relate that only because the order in which you see these movies is important. Specifically, by the time I saw VS, I knew everything about the story, and there was no longer any sense of unraveling a mystery that is an important part of these movies. But that is not all. On almost every score, Abre Los Ojos is the better movie. First the acting. In ALO, Penelope Cruz is sweet, loving and heartbreakingly beautiful. Reprising the same role in VS, she struggles with her Spanish accent, and there is absolutely no chemistry between her and Tom Cruise. Also, her character in VS repeatedly engages in a strange kind of smart-alecky banter that is not funny and is just plain misplaced in this movie. And yes, I hate to say it, but Ms. Cruz is nowhere near as attractive in VS as she was in ALO. Watch the movies back-to-back and the difference is startling. As for the other characters, I thought the spurned female role was better done in ALO. The actress who played Nuria in ALO conveyed a palpable sense of desperation and sadness, but also vulnerability. When she kills herself, and tries to take Cesar with her, it's believable. Not so with Cameron Diaz's portrayal of that same character in VS, who comes off as a spoiled tramp whose decision to kill herself seems like a hissy fit. That may not be all her fault. For instance, during the critical scene where she kills herself and tries to kill Cruise, Diaz is forced to utter dialog that is dopey and distractingly vulgar. Nuria has more grace, and more depth. Tom Cruise is not a terrible male lead, but the Spanish actor who played Cesar in ALO is much better suited for the role. He is younger, and portrays youthful arrogance and insouciance perfectly. There is also an innocence about him that Cruise can no longer do. Especially physically. At times in VS, I was thinking more about Tom Cruise's weightlifting regimen more than the mental anguish of his character. Unlike the crippling sadness of Cesar, Cruise's character is a turbo-charged superstar. In fact, it's not until the final scene, when the truth unravels itself, that Cruise finally brings his performance down to a human level. Last, the music. ALO has an unobtrusive, Hitchcockian score (see Vertigo to get my drift) that is haunting, and is very effective in creating a brooding, dreamlike atmosphere. Cameron Crowe's blaring soundtrack in VS, conversely, is a slick pop cliché that detracts, instead of enhances, the experience. The musical differences really do speak volumes here. ALO is dark, ethereal, and moving. VS is loud, brash, and coarse.",Abre Los Ojos

The film centers around the life of a rich and handsome young man after a disfiguring accident.  We are taken along as he tries to find a way to grow accustomed to a life without the things he relied on (mainly looks) before. After hitting rock bottom, things start to get better for him, and it is here that the seamless weaving of genres occur.

1121,Being John Malkovich,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0444701/,"A prime example of just because you have not seen anything like it before, does not make it a cinematic masterpiece.  Scuzzy puppeteer John Cusack and snide co-worker Catherine Keener discover a portal into the mind of actor John Malkovich (playing himself) in their bizarre office and decide to profit from it.  Marketed as a comedy, the film is inventive, most definitely original, but the laughs virtually dry up after the first 40 minutes.  The strange plot takes one bizarre turn after another, incorporating lesbianism, spousal abuse and cults into the mix.  Events become more and more sinister, disturbing and serious during the running time.  Unfortunately, the main characters, including an unrecognizable Cameron Diaz as Cusack's frumpy wife, are so odious that it becomes impossible to identify with them, and by the climax one really does not care what is done to whom.  Keener is initially terrific as the reprehensible profiteer, but she is given limited notes to play.  Malkovich may be a good sport, but he is a pretty dull character as envisioned here.  It is hard to recall Cusack ever being this unappealing.  Director Spike Jonze has definite potential, but his ambition spins out of control far too quickly on this project.  Even the look of the film, with everything in drab blues and greys, is a downer.  For all of the hype, the film is an amazingly empty experience.",Being John Malkovich

Cameron Diaz is nearly unrecognizable, both in behavior and appearance, as is John Cusack. John Malkovich was presented with an interesting opportunity in playing himself, and he seems to have seized the opportunity with relish.  He is most definitely not being himself in front of the camera, but instead creates this wonderful character of John Malkovich the vessel.I've admired Spike Jonez's work for a good long time, and I'm pleased to say that in his first full length feature as a director, he succeeds with flying colors in creating an original, beautiful, humorous, and good natured picture.See Being John Malkovich, because come Oscar time, you're going to want to know why its winning!",Being John Malkovich

They call it ""idiot's dinner"". For them it's like a championship where they try to find the dumbest guy on earth! But this time Pierre can't go to the dinner, because he hurt himself when he was playing golf, so he must stays in his own home. However, he had already invited Mr Pignon (the dumb guy) to the dinner and when Mr Pignon arrived, Pierre's nightmare will begin! This movie is really funny because it transforms little common circumstances into hilarious sequences! For example, a simple phone call is turned into a hilarious scene! I mean, I cried of laughing when I was watching this movie! There are four/five scenes that are really funny and simple at the same time. It proves that is not needed a large budget to make a great film. In fact, this movie even seems to be adapted from a theatrical play. I don't know if it is or not, but it seems so, because of the simplicity of its setting (almost all the film is shot inside Pierre's apartment).About the acting: It's done a very good work, especially by Jacques Villeret, the actor which plays Mr Pignon's character. He's really impressive as a dumb! He's truly a world champion!

The acting was good and the directing average. But the writing and screenplay were absolutely fantastic. You don't need to know French to watch it as long as you can get your hands on a copy with subtitles.

1126,Donnie Brasco,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0942774/,"Yes, I am going to make the bold claim that this is his best work. ""Are you talking about the same Al Pacino that did Scarface, Heat, AND the Godfather movies"" you ask. Yes, yes, and let me explain myself. First of all, I want to add that I LOVE Pacino's work. He has such a commanding presence on screen and nobody in cinematic history can scream as well as him (though Gene Hackman is damn good). He can scare the hell out of you with just one crazed look in his eye and he never gives a flat performance (well, except in Revolution).Having said that, I think Pacino is incredible in this flick because his character is so understated. While his work often consists of playing flamboyant, over-the-top, and almost cartoonish figures(especially in Scarface and The Devil's Advocate), this film is a change of pace for him. Sure, he's still playing a mobster, but he's not as psychotic as usual, and for once, you get to see the inner struggles of a crook who deep down has a heart of gold (despite all of the murders). Pacino is perfect as Lefty, an aging crimical who wants out of the mob lifestyle, but doesn't know how to do it. Though you see the fast and fun world of mobsters in flicks like Goodfellas, this film gives you a sense that the mob life isn't that glamorous. Along with Pacino's acting, Johnny Depp is delectable as Joe Pistone (Donnie Brasco) because you can see his inner torment as well. He knows that he's been assigned to infiltrate the New York mob scene, but he develops such a close bond with Lefty that it's almost hard to bring him down. A very real, human relationship permeates between the two that is very moving. I like how the characters are always joking about being a ""wise guy,"" as it provides some light chuckles, and it also shows that in order to live this lifestyle, you've gotta talk tough and act tough (as if I would know what that's like).The supporting cast is particularly noteworthy. Bruno Kirby plays a great weasel, Anne Heche is wonderful as Pistone's neurotic wife (you can understand her suffering, what with being married to an FBI special agent) and Michael Madsen is reliable, once again, as a mobster (honestly, does this guy do anything besides gangster or sci-fi flicks?). Every time I watch this movie I am breathless afterwards. The acting is wonderful, the music is superb, and frankly, I can't believe this stuff actually happened. Then again, I haven't read the book, so I don't know how much of it is true.Overall, this movie gets 10 out of 10. I'm shocked it doesn't get more recognition, especially with such prolific actors as Pacino and Depp leading the way. This is a different kind of mob movie, as it shows a more somber side to this way of life, and I recommend it unequivocally.",Donnie Brasco

But Edward Norton's turn as the ""defendant/victim"" in Primal Fear is one of those ""Wow"" moments that leaves the audience salivating for his next performance. In this feature debut, Norton outdistances his role, as does Richard Gere, in a resurrection no less impressive than Norton's star-making turn. Heretofore, Gere has specialized in assorted intelligent professional cad roles. Here, he gets a chance to inhabit one that not only wears his dubious character on his sleeve, but wears it, drives it, drinks it... revels in it. Yeah, sure somewhere there's a heart of gold, but like his client, the layers on top serve him better, and the heart of gold is tarnished. Gere is at his peak, comfortably, cheerfully inhabiting the role.
Laura Linney deserves extra credit for often being the ice-queen foil which propels the two male characters' development; her own character is rather one- dimensional, but she herself squeezes as much dazzle as she can from it. Even though everyone else obviously falls for whatever Gere's Vail purrs into their ears, it's merely enough time for Linney's Janet to get a drag on her ubiquitous cigarette; another step in what will (hopefully) someday be film's love affair with her. Wasted, sadly, are fine character actors like John Mahoney, Steven Bauer, Maura Tierney & Andre Braugher who could have lit up the screen had they not been handed scripts with generic character stereotypes.See it to watch the ascension of Norton and Gere.",Primal Fear

Sarah is a lovely character who keeps a good attitude regardless and is both charming and kind. The movie is full of beautiful moments.My primary complaints about the film are probably due to its short running time. While I generally support keeping things short, there are times when things are simply unexplained. For example, the movie really needed to show us what the lawyer said to Miss Minchin, because without that explanation, it came across as a highly improbably turn in the narrative put there entirely to propel the story, as opposed to something that is likely to have happened (the book, from what I've read on wikipedia, makes more sense in this regard).

It's a fast sequence of five different shots which emphasizes the magic moment for the girl. The astonishing surprise relaxes the magic to a real world that can be good, just with the appearance of the little monkey of the Hindu servant Ram Dass (Errol Sitahal), showing to us that he, in some way, transformed the attic in the meanwhile sleep of the two girls.Another exceptional, but very simple made scene, is when Miss Minchin (Eleanor Bron), in a crude way informs Sara that her father, an English captain of the British army, died in the war some weeks ago, and the British government confiscated all his properties, leaving her in misery. At the same time that the speech occurs, a black balloon slowly displaces floating near, exploding at the very moment in when she says that she's completely alone in the world, symbolizing that her fantasies are dead and must face the crude reality.It's interesting to note that the hero of her fantastic stories, Prince Rama, is her own father in the movie (Liam Cunningham) and the heroin, Princess Sita (Alison Moir), is her mother, who died some years ago.The interpretation of all the actors its extremely well directed and performed but the roll of Miss Minchin (Eleanor Bron) is remarkable.It's not a movie about a false expectance; it's a movie about fantasies and the necessities to have a hope in the future, being able to dream and therefore make plans.

Great directing for 3 stories: The story of an assassin, lonely and living day to day deciding weather it's really worth continuing with his profession or not; the story of his partner, a beautiful woman who relies her loneliness on her obsession with her partner; and the story of a mute guy that works at night in all the closed stores and markets, and with the different encounters with a woman and his relation with his father. All three stories are stories of loneliness, of love affairs impossible to fulfill and of the wish of each one to find a meaning to their existence. Like in all movies of WKW, all characters are solitary. This movie is another one of the directors masterpieces, trying to describe all the lonely souls in Hong Kong and the impossibility of finding a meaning to their life, their professions and a meaning to love.

The bigger the population, the more busy the city, the more people develop the ability to retreat into an inner isolation, the space of a snackbar, a tatami mat, a computer screen, a song playing on headphones.In the next century we will all live like this.Wong Kar Wei maps out a perfectly postmodern, perfectly oriental psychogeography of small, busy places which nevertheless become the spawning ground of ultra-private obsessions and infatuations. Love in his films is more likely to be expressed by someone breaking into your apartment and tidying it, or by masturbation, than a healthy clinch. It is the mindset of ultrafetish, and cinematographer Chris Doyle puts it into images: a clear plastic sheath worn over a Chinese silk dress, a mute riding the corpse of a pig in an abattoir, a blow up sex doll with its head stuck in an elevator door, being kicked insanely by a couple of ultra-romantic maniacs.And there is the real star, the traum-city itself. Corridors, subways, neon, time lapse, travelators and low flying jets, trains, shopping arcades, Chung King Mansions stuffed to the gullets with sullen, sweating people cooled by antique electric fans, the scheming tattooed triads, outbursts of random violence, warehouses, chopping knives, video cameras, motorbikes speeding through tunnels, the multi-racial hand in hand with the super-commercial... Hong Kong insinuates itself into our imaginations as the ubertraumstadt, the place of ultimate nightmare and ultimate romance, where beauty is all the more poignant for its dark, cheap, pitiless setting and dreams are all the more necessary.""",Fallen Angels
1135,Il Postino,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1098413/,"Michael Radford, an English director, ought to be given credit for bringing this beautiful story to the screen. It speaks volumes that Mr. Radford achieves a triumph with a film that for all practical purposes should have been directed by an Italian. This is a timeless story of friendship, poetry and love set in a desolated island that was to be Pablo Neruda's home in exile.The story is a simple one. Mario Ruoppolo, a poor man without a job, suddenly applies for a vacant position that will pay almost nothing, but by becoming a letter carrier he gets the chance of meeting a man that will make a deep impression on him and who will change his life completely.Mario, the postman, is almost illiterate. He can read and write, with only the basic knowledge he probably picked up in the island school. He is allergic to fishing, and can't make a living like his father, and probably most of his ancestors before him. It's the time after WWII in which a poor Italy is still recovering from the devastation and defeat.Pablo Neruda, the Chilean poet, finds a rustic home in the island. He is the most famous person ever to set foot in there. Mario is in charge for bringing Pablo his packages and mail. An easy friendship develops between them. Like everyone else in the island, Mario is impressed by the foreigner. In trying to imitate his poet friend, Mario awakens to all the beauty around him and discovers love with the gorgeous local girl, Beatrice Russo.The film's mood changes right after Pablo Neruda and his wife receive assurances they can go back to their native land. This leaves Mario in a sad state, but now that he is married, he has other responsibilities to live for. Neruda had awakened in Mario a desire to speak for himself and to seek justice.This is a film totally dominated by the late Italian actor Massimo Troisi, who as Mario, completely captures us by just being a simple soul with no malice. Mr. Troisi is splendid in his take of this poor man who discovers beauty and poetry late in his life. Philippe Noiret, is Pablo Neruda. Mr. Noiret makes a great contribution as the man who sees beauty everywhere and translates it into poetry. Maria Grazia Cucinotta is the beautiful Beatrice, the woman who loves Mario. Renato Scarpa and Linda Moretti, play minor roles with success.""Il Postino"" is helped by the magnificent cinematography of Franco di Giacomo who captures the island in all its splendor. The music score is another asset. Luis Bacalov's tuneful background music adds another layer in this film rich texture. This film is an excellent way to be introduced to Pablo Neruda's poetry, even if it's only for the curiosity the film will give even a casual viewer. Thanks to Michael Radford for a poetic view of this lonely place where two people meet and are changed forever.",Il Postino

1139,Philadelphia,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0326768/,"Philadelphia is a guttingly emotional and tragic story of how a lawyer fired for having AIDS attempts to vindicate himself in court.  Tom Hanks gives perhaps the most powerful performance of his career as Andrew Beckett, the afflicted lawyer.  He received the Academy Award in a waltz, and you could almost pick any of his major scenes as worthy of the award.This movie is probably the best drama regarding gay issues ever made. Remember, it was made in 1993, when AIDS was still a terminal disease, and it recalls the early days of an epidemic that may not square with the vision afforded today, but at the time, this was the reality of AIDS. 
The entire crew is A-List.  Tak Fujimoto, who would also film Silence of the Lambs and Sixth Sense, directed cinematography.  Jonathan Demme, also of Silence of the Lambs fame, directs with typical honesty and grit.  Bruce Springsteen and Neil Young contributed hauntingly touching original songs. Even Antonio Banderas, whom I never miss an opportunity to vilify, is moving as Hanks' devoted and supportive partner.  Denzel Washington was well cast as the homophobic lawyer who ultimately takes Hanks' case, and Mary Steenburgen is surprising in an uncharacteristic villain role.Ron Vawter, who played one of the lawyers in the firm from which Hanks was fired, and also appeared in Silence of the Lambs, was himself suffering from AIDS at the time of filming, and he eventually succumbed to it a few years later.  His appearance in the film encapsulates the reality of the AIDS epidemic, in that it often touched our lives in unexpected places.Although I have literally thousands of movies in my collection, I don't own this one.  Not because I don't love it.  I do.  It's because I can't watch it without being overcome by emotion.  Anyone who can watch Hanks' in the Opera scene, or hear Springsteen's or Young's eerie and melancholy ballads and not weep is dead inside.

1140,The Muppet Christmas Carol,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0310453/,"While the 1951 Alistair Sim version of A Christmas Carol is the most faithful to the original Dickens story, A Muppet Christmas Carol possesses heart, whimsey, and a joy that is so very much lacking in our evermore commercialized holiday season.  Michael Caine's performance as Scrooge easily surpasses those of Reginald Owen (1938), George C. Scott (1984) and Patrick Stewart (2001).  There is a more genuine degree of transformation and redemption in his characterization than has often been portrayed. This makes the story a truly wonderful experience both for adults as well as for children.The use of the Muppets in the various roles makes for a lively film experience.  Statler and Waldorf as Jacob & Robert Marley are appropriately heckling as they seek to convince Scrooge to change his ways.  Kermit the Frog is a wonderfully sympathetic Bob Crachit just as Miss Piggy is appropriately and aggressively belligerent Mrs. Crachit.  Perhaps one of the better-inspired comedy bits comes with the arrival of Scrooge and the Ghost of Christmas Past at Scrooge's former workplace, described as ""Fozziwig's Rubber Chicken Factory.""  Such bits are frequent and help to keep the story fun.  Paul Williams' music score and songs are eminently singable and leave the viewer with a lasting memory.A Muppet Christmas Carol has joined the pantheon of classic holiday films, easily ranking alongside Holiday Inn, White Christmas and A Christmas Story. It is the opinion of this reviewer that for those whom holiday films have become a part of holiday celebration should make this a part of their seasonal experience.  One might even complete the film humming the tunes and thinking better of themselves as well as of their fellow humans.  In other words, Henson and company have made Dickens story as memorable as Dickens himself wished it to be.",The Muppet Christmas Carol

I've also downloaded and read many of Malcolm's greatest speeches, "" Ballot or the Bullet"" is an example of one. As is visible, this movie has touched me in many ways. Denzel Washington's performance of the ex-Muslim leader is amazing. The only thing more amazing is the fact that he lost out in the Oscar race to Pacino, who portrayed a less important figure, by far. Angela Bassett, a beautiful black actress, plays his wife, Betty Shabazz, in a magnificent role. Delroy Lindo, Albert Hall, Al Freeman Jr., Theresa Randle, and Spike Lee himself all play great roles in the movie. Spike Lee was right.

From his very early childhood to his violent death, the audience is given lots and lots information on the character as the film runs about 195 minutes.

1143,The Last of the Mohicans,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0964695/,"""The Last of the Mohicans"" was one of the most popular and acclaimed films of 1992. Its vision of early America, as it was during the French and Indian War, is captured in its utter brutality and beauty, complete with the many driving ambitions and clashing cultures of everyone involved.This movie has a bit of everything, including action, romance, war, and passionate drama. The director, Michael Mann, knows the story well and does all but completely discard James Fenimore Cooper's source material, which some have dubbed as being racist and totally unfair in its portrait of Native Americans.The story (and what a story) is all over the place, with three frontier scouts - Hawkeye (Daniel Day-Lewis), Chingachgook (Russell Means), and Uncas (Eric Schweig) - escorting a British colonel's daughters - Cora and Alice Munro (Madeleine Stowe and Jodhi May respectively) - to safety at the besieged Fort William Henry. Major Duncan Heyward (Steven Waddington) rivals Hawkeye for Cora's affections and a vengeance-driven Huron named Magua (Wes Studi) seeks to have both daughters killed in retribution for the loss of his own children.This is by far Mann's best film yet (it ranks #15 on my all-time favorite movies list) and he uses the lush wilderness settings to great effect. He also makes good use of the editing, which actually comes in handy when showcasing the brutal violence that dominates much of the film's action sequences. The film's last 20 minutes are a definite stunner that can only be described as classic and vicious.This is a great movie that shows America in its infancy, complete with the rivalries, intrigue, and violence that I'm sure was an everyday part of life during this hectic time period.10/10",The Last of the Mohicans
1144,The Last of the Mohicans,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1818234/,"My all time favorite film. Still gives me chills. It's easily one of the most amazing films I've ever seen and it also features perhaps one of the greatest soundtracks ever. They way, the music hits the scenes is just absolutely astonishing.In essence, The Last of the Mohicans is an epic adventure/romance set against the panorama of a frontier wilderness ravaged by the French and Indian War.Director Michael Mann brilliantly captures the essence of the era ( 1750's)-the hand-to hand battles, the scalping's, the harsh life in the wilderness, etc. But, I especially love the way that the film depicts the perspectives of each of the groups and the people involved. Whether they are competing for military superiority, referring to the French General Montcalm ( Patrice Chéreau ) and the British Colonel Munro (Maurice Roëves) or the simple existence of peoples in their homeland, the viewer is given a true sense of their mindset in the midst of a great conflict.Even the story's main antagonist, Magua (wonderfully portrayed by Wes Studi) draws us in.The always amazing Daniel Day-Lewis stars as Hawkeye, rugged frontiersman and adopted son of the Mohicans. Day-Lewis, with flowing mane and heaving pecs, makes a virile but sensitive hero for the screen and Madeline Stowe is Cora Munro, aristocratic daughter of the proud British Colonel Munro. Stowe manages to find in Cora a fiery balance between sensitivity and strength. One can't help but feel fascinated and/ or captivated by her dark eyes and flowing dark hair.Generally, the film tells the story of Hawkeye and Cora Munro, two people who meet across cultural and class barriers, and are presented serious new challenges.But the film has so more. For example, the contrasts between the two brothers ( Hawkeye and Uncas) and the two sisters ( Cora and Alice). Hawkeye being the more daring and outspoken from the start. He dares to approach the dark haired Cora when he was drawn to her, where as Uncas (Eric Schweig) never openly reveals his attraction to Alice ( Jodhi May). Besides, those short simple looks and glances.But then again, do we really need lines? No. Both Schweig and May have very few lines, but it is their eyes, that are saying everything... Case in point, that sequence in the cave, where Uncas pulls Alice back from the falls and holds her.All in all, I have to honestly say that the last 40 or 50 minutes or so of this movie, are just completely off the hook. I'd wager it might start along the lines of hearing that huge Huron war party cry as the British Army retreats from Ft. William Henry. This leads to Hawkeye vow to rescue Cora no matter what in the scene that takes place behind the waterfall. This is a scene that has been copied and mimicked by many others ( notably Tom Cruise in M1-2) but the way Day-Lewis delivers the line ""You stay alive, no matter what occurs! I will find you. No matter how long it takes, no matter how far, I will find you"" simply makes you believe him.Another amazing sequence would be when our heroes are running up the hill to save Cora, Alice, and the British Maj. Duncan Heyward (Steven Waddington) after they've been captured. For whatever, reason the Directors Expanded DVD emits the haunting Clannad song, ""I Will Find You"". Why this isn't heard during the scene is beyond me.I've watched this film way too many times now, but easily it is the last 15 minutes that are the most powerful and emotionally devastating. For instance, just watch the way the sequence of music starts with Duncan shouting ""take her and get out"", you know that something serious is going to happen and Duncan is doomed......Or the scene of Uncas's and then Alice's shocking deaths. I've always viewed the later scene as the first time Alice takes control of her own destiny and chooses not to be a victim. She finally snaps out of her shock-induced haze and takes action. Her choice of suicide is made from a place of strength.But it is also the more quiet of moments that simply resonate. For instance, when Chingachgook ( Russell Means) speaks about being the Last of his tribe.A film that truly resonates. No matter the age or the mood.",The Last of the Mohicans

1146,Porco Rosso,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5290334/,"This movie is so beautiful, well thought out, both in story and artwork, yet it is way too underrated. In my review, I will be focusing on addressing those critical/negative comments rather than repeating how good it is, which is already done by many others. I think the complaints mostly falls into 2 categories, mostly because they overlooked the hints, and maybe because of the inaccurate dub/sub. As a Japanese, I watched the film in original Japanese, and I hope I can contribute to the review by adding some accuracy and new perspectives. Followings are the 2 main complaints I've found, and my replies to them.1. No Explanation for why he became a pig.To tell the truth, I didn't get it either when I first watched it as a kid, but now that I've grown older, it is quite clear that the curse that transformed Marco into a pig is self-inflicted. Someone wrote a perfect interpretation which I'm quoting here: ""The curse that transformed Marco into a pig is self-inflicted, because he survived the battle while Gina's husband (and Marco best friend) didn't. He feels guilty and he transformed into a pig because he feels he doesn't deserve love and happiness"". Pig is often used to describe ""worthless"" or ""disgusting"" person in Japan, and it is understandable that he sees himself as a pig out of survivor's-guilt. This self-deprecation is shown many times throughout the film, such as when Gina told him that her 3rd husband didn't make it home alive, he responded ""the good guys never do,"" making explicit this contrast between himself and a good guy. Also, another thing to take note is that he was sick of the wars, and had very little faith in mankind. Living in isolated island alone, and his phrase ""I'd rather be a pig than a fascist"", ""You should do those kind of things just between you humans"" all imply that.How come he turned back into human (although the face was never shown, it is clear that he returned to human) in the end then? His phrase ""Fio, you're a good girl. You make me feel like mankind are not that bad after all"" might be the key. While spending time with Fio, seeing her innocent affection to him and to the aircraft, Marco slowly recovered from self-deprecation, and also recovered the faith to mankind. Although Fio was never an object of romantic interest for Marco, she's the one who helped Marco to change the view on himself and to the mankind. That's why the kiss from Fio worked.2. Open Ending / no conclusion (Gina or Fio, not being shown. Which is actually not true)I've seen many people complaining that the film didn't show whether Marco chose Gina or Fio in the end. Some even criticizing Miyazaki as ""lazy"", that he couldn't decide the conclusion himself so left it to viewers imagination. This is very wrong. Miyazaki showed the result in a very subtle way, that only careful people will notice. You just need to combine 2 things.1) When Curtis visited Gina in her secret garden, she told Curtis ""I'm now making a bet. If he (Marco) ever visits me while I'm in this garden during the daytime, I've decided I will truly love him. But that idiot, he only comes to the bar in the night time, never showing himself during the daytime.""2) In the last part, from the sky looking down to Hotel Adriana (from Fio's airplane), you will find Marco's red aircraft docked next to Gina's secret garden, during the DAYTIME. Gina won the bet. Also, in the end, the secret garden was shown again, but without Gina being there. Gina no longer needs to be there waiting for Marco.Miyazaki set the conclusion in a very subtle way, make it kind of rewarding for those people who noticed it, and for those people who didn't, he gave the space for imagination.
Some people might not be happy that Fio wasn't the one chosen after spending so much time building the relationship with Marco, but as I wrote earlier, even though she helped Marco recovering from self-deprecation, she was never an object of romance for Marco. Marco was always out there for Gina, as Gina thanking Marco in the beginning. As Gina told Curtis, ""Love here is a bit more complicated than back in your country"".",N/A
1147,Glengarry Glen Ross,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3585136/,"One can't escape the feeling that it's a play. Very little is invested in the setting - most of the film is in an office.

And their annoying habits of bothering their victims as much as possible. As the story unfolds, characters evolve properly. Some don't.The dialogues are intense, as it is written for plays. The mind tricks the salesmen are pulling are just amazing and may be compared to scenes of other great movies like The Wolf of Wall Street.The little substance of the plot - the sales team of a real estate office is put under pressure, as someone robbed it - is not annoying by the drama added. You can just feel Jack Lemon's tiredness of years and years of finding victims.One thing was annoying: once you start to notice it's based on a play, you start to notice the limitations.

I give out 10s about as often as Stanley Kubrick made films, and Glengarry Glen Ross is one of them.There is so much more in this film than just a bunch of guys in a real estate office. I'm puzzled, as an aside, why the language is considered such a big deal. There is less of it in GGR than in the average DeNiro film I watch. Maybe it's because the film is composed of almost nothing but dialogue.Back to the content. GGR contains at least two, maybe three of my favorite performances by anyone. Baldwin, who I really don't like, is perfect. Lemmon is excruciatingly good, and Pacino actually makes me forget who I'm watching. He really sinks into his character. Pryce also gives a commendable performance.For those who didn't get this film, who think it's just dark and pointless, here's the point. The title is Glengarry Glen Ross. If you listen to the conversations you will notice that the Glengarry leads are the new leads, the ones given to closers, the leads given to those who go out and squeeze as much money out of people as they can so they don't lose their jobs.Glen Ross farms are talked about in a brilliantly written conversation between Ed Harris and Alan Arkin, the one when Harris orders donuts and Arkin keeps repeating back to him what he said. ""..Boots, yes."" In that conversation, Harris talks about what he learned when he first got into the sales racket. You don't sell one car to a guy, you sell him 5 cars over fifteen years. But, he says, those guys who come in and burn everyone for as much money as they can get and then go to Argentina ruined a good thing. The drive to win the Cadillac had ruined the ideal of maintaining a mutually beneficial relationship between customer and salesman. Sharks like Baldwin came in, made their millions, and left a wasteland for the ""losers"" to work in.The film is about how business in America is war, and about how the drive for capital has ultimately dehumanized us. The strongest contrast is between Baldwin and Lemmon. Baldwin is a machine. Everything in his life, his very identity, is defined by the fact that his watch cost more than a ""loser's"" car. ""Family man? Go home and play with your kids."" ""A loser is always a loser."" His name is that he drives a BMW.With Lemmon, pay attention to the brief references to his daughter. The man is desperate to make money, not only to keep his job, but to pay for his daughter's medical treatment. A very human thing.Eventually, these men prey not only on customers, but on each other. It's vicious. If you don't understand why, all you'll see is the viciousness, and you probably won't enjoy the film.",Glengarry Glen Ross

1151,Barton Fink,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0291215/,"Spoiler Alert 98% of the above user comments have totally missed the idea of this movie, and yet some have gotten it exactly correct without even realizing it. Here is THE WHOLE POINT OF THIS MASTERPIECE MOVIE...Those that stated that the first 2/3 of the movie is boring and then it starts to pick up when the action begins, have unwittingly seen the plot, and masterfully fulfilled its premise. See, Barton Fink is a boring, artsy, impassioned Jewish writer, that gets one lucky break, and is instantly summoned to write a movie that the execs are sure ""will be a winner"" (no pressure there, right Hollywood?). But since he is so much an ""artist"", he cannot lower himself to the level of writing a simple wrestling film, desiring instead to write witty stories about ""the common man"", films that ""really mean something"". Then he refuses to listen to common man stories, stuck instead on his own ideas of what that should be. Well, OK, what is obvious here? Well the Coens for one, are Jewish WRITERS/ FILMMAKERS, who got one lucky break, ""Blood Simple"", and then were given the open door to make Hollywood films, are always branded as mere ""artists"", too idealistic for the majority of the masses (their movies are rarely fully appreciated or understood, and make only a small profit, but their genius high critic ratings keeps them afloat). So THEY ARE Barton Fink, quite literally and intentionally. It is THEIR personal tale, ensconced in a symbolic cloak. Summary: Barton wants to write for the common man, and yet what the common man wants to see is this dumb ""B""-rated wrestling flick, not some heartfelt idealistic piece about some friendly yokel. They want predictable mystery, unadulterated violence and blood, guns blazing, detectives crunching, and loud sex. As Barton stares at the image of his idealism (the beach picture), he longs for his ill conceived idealism to take form and materialize onto the paper. But of course it is a failure, because he sees himself as an ""artist"", not as a business man with epic visions. Which is why finally, the mysterious Audrey (the real writer he is supposed to consult), who always helps Mayhew's stories out of a jam, becomes the catalyst for this story as well, by initiating the sex/horror/detective story as soon as she is asked to. Normal writers apparently are like either Fink or Mayhew, but she sees through to what makes for real-world successful writing (not some dorky contrived ""common man"" story), and she initiates the final action-filled finale immediately. This is PURE GENIUS! ""Adaptation"" as one user here mentioned is like this film, because of the similarity in how the plot loops back in on itself. But this one is much more subtle, to the point where the ""common man"" would not even understand this movie, and thereby fulfill its message, that all people want are the action films that Hollywood dishes to us, just like the mogul states over and over, and we see delivered on the last third of the celluloid. In the end, Fink realizes his idealism, that what he really wanted is to get his artistic view rejected, so that he can maintain his idealistic (unrealistic) outlook, which is his true passion, the ""fight"" for self fulfillment. This is personified by the appearance of the girl on the beach, with Fink still not realizing what would be in the box, because he doesn't comprehend Hollywood thinking or action movies (or ""mainstream"" movies or plots). But he has achieved his goal, as has the movie for Joel and Ethan, as both being an incredibly well-thought and executed film, both an art flick, and an action piece with more perfectly executed symbolism than anyone since Wells.Now you know why it won all the Cannes awards that year, and why these two brothers from St. Louis Park Minnesota are gods of the art film, while the contrasting Warchowski brothers were once gods of the ""common man"" film (the first Matrix at least). The Warchowski's even named the subtitle of the Matrix Reloaded as ""The Burly Man"", which if you look closely (zoom in), is the name of Barton Fink's mystery screenplay, thereby once again fulfilling the intention of this film to the fullest (that what common people want is delivered like clockwork in the Matrix), just like pure Bible prophecies.

The first-rate script is full of punchy dialogue that seems straight out of a Dashiell Hammett novel. The cast is as good as it gets with amazing work from Gabriel Byrne, Marcia Gay Harden, John Turturro, Albert Finney, and Jon Polito. It's such an entertaining and fun movie, particularly for fans of old-school gangster books and films.",N/A
1153,Miller's Crossing,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0285539/,"One of the great undiscovered gems of recent movie history.  In my opinion, Miller's crossing is easily the best of the Coen brothers' films, and one of the true classics of American cinema.On the surface, the story of warring gangsters in 1920's America is one that has been told many times before.  But never before has it been handled with such artistry and precision.  The (rather violent) action scenes keep the movie going along at a brisk pace, and the camera work is every bit the equal of ""Fargo"".I became a lifelong Gabriel Byrne fan as a result of this movie, despite his best efforts to disappoint me since.  Byrne's Tom Reagan is a compellingly amoral character, who takes more unchallenged beatings than perhaps anyone in film history.  Men beat him up.  Women beat him up.  Collection men, bookies, gangsters, and even his boss gives him a terrible thrashing, and he hardly lifts a finger in opposition (with one notably humorous exception).Albert Finney is tremendous as Leo, the local crime boss.  His ""Danny Boy"" scene should go down in film history as one of the greatest pieces ever filmed.  Jon Polito is at once absurdly funny and threateningly psychotic as Johnny Caspar, Leo's rival in the turf war.  J.E. Freeman, John Turturro, and Marcia Gay Harden all lend strong support in a cast that was assembled and performs to near perfection.I will never understand why this film has not received more recognition and acclaim.  As an example of the modern style of Film Noir, it has no equals (""The Usual Suspects"" would rate a close second).  Among gangster films, only ""The Godfather"" can compete, and ""Miller's Crossing"" features superior pacing and dialog, although it lacks ""The Godfather's"" epic proportions. Perhaps someday this film will receive, like ""The Manchurian Candidate"" and ""Touch of Evil"", the belated accolades it so richly deserves.",Miller's Crossing
1154,Who Framed Roger Rabbit,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0263682/,"Stop and think about this movie for a minute, and you realize that we are unbelievably fortunate that it even exists.Think about all the different cartoon characters who have cameos here. Think about how their respective owners had to put aside decades of competing against each other for gags that would last a few seconds of screen time.  Realise that, before this movie, the idea of combining fully rendered animated characters with live action footage was considered impossible.  And how the hell do you market a movie that includes both murder plots and fuzzy little cartoons?This movie is a miracle.I absolutely loved it as a kid, and although parts of it flew over my head I really did not care.  I did know that this is what animation can do when all the ""rules"" are totally ignored.  And why shouldn't they be?Now, as an adult, I appreciate ""Roger Rabbit"" for its gutsyness.

1155,The Vanishing,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0262370/,"There aren't too many scenarios like this one. The original version and the Hollywood remake of this film were both directed by the same man, George Sluizer. As I understand from popular opinion, this is one film that was fine the first time round, and not well received on the second go. I cannot fairly compare them, and I have no more desire to see the remake of ""Spoorloos"" than I do the remake of ""La Femme Nikita"", namely ""The Point Of No Return"".I saw the original version upon the strong recommendation of a newspaper reviewer proclaiming it one of the most disturbing films they'd ever seen. The photograph of a young couple about to be torn apart in the paper reeled me in.A pleasant holiday excursion goes horribly wrong when a man's lady friend goes missing at a crowded rest stop. He grasps at straws in desperation as very little can be done because few clues or leads exist. The abduction is arbitrary and nearly flawless.The film was indeed well done and what struck me the most was the focus on that of the villain. It is a portrayal of a normal, respectable family man who trains himself in meticulous detail for an abduction. His cold, calculating approach is probably the most frightening aspect. His inhumanity is difficult to comprehend.Many film endings can be shocking and may stick with you forever, and for a lot of people that is certainly the case with this film. That's why I was surprised to learn that the TV commercials for this film gave away the ending. However it didn't ruin the film for me.The suspense and chilling setting of this film makes it hard to forget. The viewer constantly wondering, ""What would I do?"" or ""How would I cope?"". Impossible questions we all hope we'll never find the answer to.Of course, keep a few handy responses in mind should you watch this with your better half when they ask the inevitable, almost rhetorical question, ""What would you do if I went missing and you couldn't find me?""""I'd surely die, dear.""",N/A

1157,Withnail & I,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0252536/,"Withnail and I is set in an old, run down student flat in London's Camden Town at the end of the 1960's. Withnail and I are a couple of unemployed actors from different ends of the social spectrum.Withnail is a Harrow educated dilettante, and rather upper crust; his flatmate Marwood is a grammar school boy with a slightly more realistic outlook on life. To escape from the squalor of their grim, unemployed, existence in Camden Town, soaked in a near lethal cocktail of alcohol and drugs, the desperate pair call upon the generosity of Withnail's uncle Montague and secure the use of his cottage in the country for a weekend.Uncle Monty is an eccentric middle-aged homosexual, who prefers vegetables to flowers. He considers that 'flowers are essentially tarts - prostitutes for the bees', and wears a radish in his buttonhole in preference to a flower. He grows vegetables in pots in his Chelsea house, and makes suggestive references to 'firm young carrots'.Withnail (excellently played by Richard E. Grant), persuades Uncle Monty (a superb Richard Griffiths) to lend Marwood (a convincing Paul McGann) and him his cottage in the country for the weekend.Their exploits at the cottage, and in Penrith where they spend their Wellington boot money on booze and try to sober up in a gentile tearoom are memorable, witty and entertaining. The incongruous uncle Monty reciting Baudelaire in the Cumbrian hills, seeking carnal knowledge of Marwood (apparently coerced by the cowardly and treacherous Withnail), are testament to the writing skills and humour of author and director, Bruce Robinson.The film's soundtrack brings us 'A Whiter Shade of Pale', played by King Curtis on the Saxophone, 'My Friend' and 'Walk hand in Hand', performed by Charlie Kunz, 'Schubert's Piano Sonata in B Flat Major' performed by Leslie Pearson, 'All Along the Watchtower' and 'Voodoo Chile', by Jimi Hendrix, 'Hang Out the Stars in Indiana', performed by Al Bowlly, and 'While My Guitar Gently Weeps', by the late lamented George Harrison, who provided much of the financial backing for this memorable film.This is a thoroughly entertaining 108 minutes of humorous entertainment, a few too many drinks, a convincing 60's atmosphere, superb performances from the excellent cast, and music to make your heart, and your guitar, gently weep.

1158,The Last Emperor,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3022709/,"If you can sit through this movie, especially the three and a half version of this film, I am proud of you. Not to say this movie is bad, but it's often tedious since there is really nothing here to move the plot. The film goes at such a slow pace, but however this film can be incredibly fascinating and the film is enriched with detail. As a history buff, I enjoyed this film as it was because of the historical narrative it induced.Bernardo Bertollucci's film is about the last emperor of China before the warlord age and communist age. The film talks about how Puyi became emperor at such an young age, how he abdicated this throne, and how he ended up as a political prisoner.The acting is really good and we needed good acting to get through a film like this. John Lone does an excellent job as the adult Puyi and really conveys his emotions very well. Peter O'Toole, one of the few Western actors here, does an excellent job as always.Overall, The Last Emperor seems like it does not have in mind to entertain, but to teach. It's a good, fascinating film that talks about changing times and how people must adapt. I was intrigued by this film because the dynasties of China has always impressed me. Is this the film that should win Best Picture at the Oscars? Perhaps not, but this is still a good film to see despite it's tepid pacing. I rate this film 8/10.",The Last Emperor
1159,Empire of the Sun,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0243215/,"Reading through the reviews, there were a lot of people who didn't understand this film.  This is Spielberg's venture into the realm of art in cinematography.  This film is a visual masterpiece and you are swept along from beginning to end.  Yes, the tale gets a bit loose in spots and you never know what's going to happen next.  But, if you're willing to give up warm and fuzzy for lush visual images and startling leaps of character, you'll see what Spielberg's trying to accomplish.  This film makes use of the talents of Miranda Richardson and gives some early exposure to the likes of John Malkovich and Ben Stiller, but young Christian Bale steals the show. The reviewer that commented on the ""gothic"" effect of the Tai-Pan's going to the costume ball being driven through Shanghai was right on.  This film is rife with such scenes and does not disappoint.  It's wholly misleading to look for some kind of action story underlying this film.  The tale, taken from the book, is straightforward enough:  a young boy's boost into manhood through the second world war.  The film is full of memorable moments and visually very, very pleasing.  As art, it is excellent.  That's likely why it wasn't a blockbuster, as say, e.g., Poltergeist, Close Encounters and the Jurassic Park films, were.  But, hey.  That's the cost of creating art as opposed to crap. And, crap does draw a lot of flies...",N/A

Most of the monks there think it's the Devil at work but William thinks it may be a human. What follows is a VERY complex and long but intriguing movie.I read the book ages ago. It was an excellent book but I didn't see how it could ever be a movie. It was very long and had tons of theological discussions. The movie throws out most of the discussions, simplifies the story (but doesn't talk down to the viewer) and moves things along as quickly as possible. The mystery is deep and puzzling but I figured it out. During the last hour or so F. Murray Abraham shows up an Inquisitor and things really get out of hand. Still I was never lost.The setting itself is bleak and remote perfectly fitting the tone of the movie. The acting is great. Connery just acts up a storm in a very pleasing, easy-going manner. Abraham takes his role and runs with it. You hate him every step of the way. Slater is given little to work with but he's still good. This is not for everybody. It portrays a somewhat realistic view of what an abbey would have looked like. It looks dirty and most of the monks look ugly and most have teeth missing! This is not a movie to watch if you want a pleasant feel-good movie. However it's great for people who don't mind the grimness and love a good mystery with theological digressions..

The film is a smorgasbord of fabulousness - exquisite concepts, very clever lines and very funny ones. No film maker has ever had such a grasp of irony, sarcasm and the ridiculous, and still imbue it with wit and (occasionally) subtlety. But it is the relentless self-deprecation and extant feelings of worthlessness that eventually become wearing after you have watched as many Allen films as I have. This is the film that most impresses you with his confusion over identity however. I could go on about self-analysis for pages but it's unnecessary...just watch any given Woody Allen film. He mellows it out with a rather forlorn sense of romance that becomes endearing rather than pathetic...a skill that is essential to engage with his films. This is a fine film. Oh yeah...and very funny...if you get the references.",N/A
1165,Zelig,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0206948/,"Yes, a masterpiece.  The entire premise of the movie is wildly original, even coming from WOODY ALLEN who continually cranks out one interesting film after another to this day.  The label of mock-umentary just doesn't do justice to the uniqueness of this film.  ALLEN and his amazingly talented staff created a movie that no other director could have made nor even thought of doing.  Some of the humor is rather modern like the forward references to self-gratification during the psychiatrist scenes with MIA FARROW.  But mostly, it's filled with humor from another time and place which we'll never return.To me, one of the wonderful aspects of this is the period music dispersed throughout with joyful admiration.  We are lucky that ALLEN has continued to use music from the early part of the 20th century.  I think no other director has so consistently had such a reverence for this wonderful music. Perhaps no other director has such a strong knowledge of it either.That WOODY ALLEN normally portrays himself as a nebbishy character in many of his own movies works so well in this movie.  A more aggressive person who becomes a chameleon would not have worked as well at all.  I am glad that MIA FARROW was still associated with him when he made this film, I think no other modern actress could have pulled this off as well as she did.  She has that timeless look that is appealing but has a far-off feeling.The flavor of the period-looking cinematography and photography is part of the genius of the implementation here.  It is so right on the money.  The flickering of projectors, the out-of-focus look to so man scenes shot today meld amazingly well with the contrived shots.THINK ABOUT THIS - this is years before CGI took over Hollywood...years before FORREST GUMP and countless of other knock-offs have proliferated in movies.  Gee whiz, there is CGI in so many movies these days.  I watched a DVD of a recent movie recently which used special effects in the most unexpected, unlikely and unnecessary parts you'd be surprised.Yes, ZELIG is a masterpiece and I only feel sorry for those who cannot see the astounding piece of cinema this is.",Zelig

I think the Academy realized their error and Newman's win for The Color of Money was really for his portrayal of Frank Galvin, in this well-done tale of moral decrepitude and ultimate redemption.  Writer Mamet and Director Lumet are into heavy symbolism throughout, with the scene of the developing Poloroids of the victim (the case becomes clear in Galvin's mind), to Galvin's pilfering of a woman's mail to run down a lead on a potential witness.

1167,The Verdict,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0198165/,"The title of this movie is deceiving.  THE VERDICT suggests a courtroom drama, something like TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD, or INHERIT THE WIND.  It does have some riveting court scenes, but what happens outside of court and to Paul Newman is the real attraction here.  The title not only refers to the inevitable decision of the important case of the film, but also to how the Newman character is going to live the rest of his life. Should he sell out and take the easy settlement, or take the highly regarded archdiocese of Boston to court for real justice.  These are the questions Newman must face in this profound drama that seems more like a picture of the 70's than an 80's film.Director Sidney Lumet has dealt with the legal system before in his first film, 12 ANGRY MEN.  He takes it to a more personal level and Paul Newman, one of the finest actors of the past 40 years, is the person to do it.  He is a legend and he bares his soul as attorney Frank Galvin, a lonely, corrupt drunk whose license to practice law is hanging by a thread.  Jack Warden plays his trusty assistant who gets him a case that could help Frank change his life.  Warden, however, has had enough.Newman plays an excellent drunk, even cracking an egg into an 8am beer to start his day.  This is a dim looking movie, shot during a cold winter in Boston.  There are no great shots, or even any emotionally-rousing speeches, but this is Lumet's style.  It is plodding and we see into the life of a lawyer on the ropes.  James Mason is perfect as the slimy defense lawyer. Newman is constantly underestimated because of past failures.

1171,Lupin the 3rd: Castle of Cagliostro,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0170555/,"The second big screen outing of Lupin III is already one of the best Anime movies ever made, while rivalling anything Disney or Pixar has to offer. Green ogres, fat superheroes or a zillion gigabytes of computer animation still cannot compare to 12 frames of hand drawn charm.For the uninitiated, Lupin III is the grandson of Arsene Lupin, the gentleman thief, created by Maurice Leblanc in the Twenties. He's always breaking into some impenetrable vault, or has a zillion gadgets up his sleeve to help with escaping if things go awry. He's also rather wacky and buffoonish, which makes his antics a joy to watch.Hayao Miyazaki (Spirited Away, Howl's Moving Castle), in his movie debut, tones down the out of control wackiness of the Lupin III TV show and gives Lupin a rather decent plot to dig his teeth into. This is not an excuse to string together a bunch of insane set pieces.Seconds after robbing a Monte Carlo casino, Lupin and Jigen discover that every dollar note they have swiped is a fake. Only one place in the world is known to make these counterfeits and Lupin's underworld knowledge leads them to the tiny European country of Cagliostro (think Luxemburg, only much, much smaller).Half a moment after crossing the border, Lupin and Jigen are involved in a car chase and rescue the Lady Clarisse from a bunch of goons. But she's promptly kidnapped again, though manages to leave Lupin a clue in the form of a strange wedding ring.Their suspicions over the kidnapping lead them to the titular castle where they discover that an evil Count has seized control of the country, using - guess what? - funny money. And the ring is the key to a great treasure that can only be uncovered when the Lady Clarisse is married to the Count.Lupin deliberately blows his cover to Inspector Zenigata (the perpetually stressed Interpol officer who is always chasing him) as a diversion, while he breaks into the castle to rescue Clarisse. What follows is scene after scene of hairs breadth escapes and impossible scenarios.Miyazaki's attention to detail is what truly elevates this beyond typical animation quality. There are enough moments of quietness and atmosphere to balance out the loud scenes. A strong sense of setting also comes from the imaginative ""photography"". Too many animated movies disorientate the audience with frenetic direction and over-indulgence, but Castle Of Cagliostro works so much better by taking its time and choosing the best angles to cover the action. His trademark flying machines and overeating scenes make their first big screen appearance here.Far from his typical sub-genre of eco-friendly animation, Miyazaki is obviously a big fan of Lupin and has made a movie that refuses to be missed. Even Spielberg called CoC ""one of the best adventure movies ever."" Any fan of Miyazaki should check out this film immediately.One should be aware that the Maurice Leblanc estate doesn't entirely approve of the Lupin III franchise. As a result he is mostly known in the new Optimum Region 2 DVD version as ""Wolf"" (get it?). The Manga release of this film was entirely re-dubbed in English with Lupin restored but the new Optimum DVD uses the original English voice actors.",Castle of Cagliostro

1173,Halloween,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0160248/,"I have just recently been through a stage where I wanted to see why it is that horror films of the 90's can't hold a candle to 70's and 80's horror films. I have been very public in this forum about the vileness of films like The Haunting and Urban Legend and such. I feel that they (and others like them) don't know what true horror is. And it bothered me to the point where it made me go to my local video store and rent some of the classic horror films. I already own all the Friday's so I rented The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, the original Nightmare On Elm Street, Jaws, The Exorcist, Angel Heart, The Exorcist and Halloween. Now the other films are classics in their own right but it is here that I want to tell you about Halloween. Because what Halloween does is perhaps something no other film in the history of horror film can do, and that is it uses subtle techniques, techniques that don't rely on blood and gore, and it uses these to scare the living daylights out of you. I was in a room by myself with the lights off and as silly as I knew it was, I wanted to look behind me to see if Michael Myers was there. No movie that I have seen in the last ten years has done that to me. No movie.John Carpenter took a low budget film and he scared a generation of movie goers. He showed that you don't need budgets in the 8 or 9 figures to evoke fear on an audience. Because sometimes the best element of fear is not what actually happens, but what is about to happen. What was that shadow? What was that noise upstairs? He knows that these are the ways to scare someone and he uses every element of textbook horror that I think you can use. I even think he made up some of his own ideas and these should be ideas that people use today. But they don't. No one uses lighting and detail to provoke scares, they use special effects and rivers of blood. And it is just not the same. You can't be scared by a giant special effect that makes loud noises and jumps out of a wall. It's the moments when the killer is lurking, somewhere, you just don't know where, that scare you. And Halloween succeeds like no other film in this endeavor.In 1963 a young Micael Myers kills his sister with a large butcher knife and then spends the next 15 years of his life, silently locked up in an institute. As Loomis ( his doctor) says to Sheriff Brackett, "" I spent eight years trying to reach him and then another seven making sure that he never gets out, because what I saw behind those eyes was pure e-vil. "" That sets up the manic and relentless idea of a killer that will stop at nothing to get what he wants. And all he wants here is to kill Laurie. No one know why he wants to kill her, but he does.( Halloween II continues the story quite well )What Carpenter has done here is taken a haunting score, mendacious lighting techniques and wrote and directed a tightly paced masterpiece of horror. There is one scene that has to be described. And that is the scene where Annie is on her way to pick up Paul. She goes to the car and tries to open it. Only then does she realize that she has left her keys in the house. She gets them, comes back out and inadvertently opens the car door without using the keys. The audience picks up on this but she doesn't. She is too busy thinking about Paul. When she sits down, she notices that the windows are fogged up. She is puzzled and starts to wipe away the mist, and then Myers strikes, from the back seat. This is such a great scene because it pays attention to detail. We know what is happening and Annie doesn't. But it's astute observations that Carpenter made that scared the hell out of movie goers in 1978 and beyond. Halloween uses blurry images of a killer standing in the background, it has shadows ominously gliding across a wall, dark rooms, creepy and haunting music, a sinister story told hauntingly by Donald Pleasance and a menacing, relentless killer. My advice to film makers in our day and age is to study Halloween. It should be the blue print for what scary movies are all about. After all, Carpenter followed in Hitchcock's steps, maybe director's should follow in his.Halloween personifies everything that scares us. If you are tired of all the mindless horror films that don't know the difference between evil and cuteness, then Halloween is a film that should be seen. It won't let you down. I enjoy being scared, I don't know why, but I do. But nothing has scared me in the 90's, except maybe one film ( Wes Craven's final Nightmare ). If you enjoy beings scared, then Halloween is one that you should see. And if you have already seen it a hundred times, go and watch it again, back to back with a film like Urban Legend. Urban Legend will have you enticed at all the pretty faces in the movie. Halloween will have you frozen with fear, stuck in your seat, not wanting to move. Now tell me, what horror film would you rather watch?And just to follow up after seeing Zombie's version, it makes you appreciate this that much more. This is a classic by definition. Zombie bastardized his version, but it doesn't take away from the brilliance of this one.",Halloween

In Polanski's world, there are no easy answers, and there is no defining what is real and what is imaginary. Fantasy and reality cross paths in unbelievably disturbing and insightful ways. Questions emerge, they are sometimes answered, and then those answers are found to be false. And then they are found to be true again. With such a mind bending work, Polanski forces the viewer to question everything they are witnessing, making this one o0f the greatest cinematic enigmas of all time.With its sharp sense of black humor and satire, ""The Tenant"" was able to tickle my funny bone as well as it was able to tingle my spine. Perplexing, haunting, and yet still often hilarious, this film combines genres in a way only mastered by the finest auteurs of cinema (I got some Lynchian vibes from much of the dark humor and surrealism, and some of the satirical elements reminded me of ""Donnie Darko"" to an extent). It is as if ""Rosemary's Baby"" were co written by an intelligent jester with the help of the spirit of Jonathan Swift. In what may be my favorite of all Polanski's masterpiece infested work, genres range from angry satire to black comedy to disturbing psychological drama to paranoid thriller to bone chilling surrealist horror in a way that feels natural in Polanski's truly unnatural world.",The Tenant
1175,The Tenant,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0148187/,"This is a wonderfully tense and intensely claustrophobic film with a slowly escalating and relentless psychologically terror. Roman Polanski stays true to his style from Rosemary's Baby and Repulsion. But this movie is more than a simple examination of the onset of insanity from within the person who is experiencing it. The theme of loneliness and the sense of purposeless petty existence are the real backdrop of this excellent work, the fact which makes it similar to Kubrick's Shining. Still, The Tenant has deeper literary roots. In my opinion, the inspiration for this movie came right from the great works of European literature -- the influence of Edgar A. Poe, E.T.A. Hoffmann and Nikolai Gogol is simply obvious. Poe's tales of madness out of loneliness, Hoffmann's stories of tragic delirium (most prominently, The Sandman, Majorat, and The Mines of Falun), and, of course, Gogol's eerie The Overcoat provided Polanski with the inspiration for this modern examination of the same topics.Trelkovsky, a French citizen of Polish origin, is a nondescript and unassuming loner who moves into an apartment the previous occupant of which, a young woman, has thrown herself out of the window. The building is owned by the stern and ice-cold old man, who is hell bent on making sure his tenants do not make any noise and do not cause any trouble. He (and his underlings in the building) consider any sign of life to be ""trouble."" The old man spends much of his time enforcing a near-police-state-like order within the building. Undeniably, all kind of extremely weird things are going on in the building and I will not dwell on them. But it is the strange intrusiveness of the police-state which injects real terror into Trelkovsky's life. Faced with absurdity after absurdity, he makes some meek attempts to complain and ask for explanations: instead, noone is even ready to listen to him -- he is being treated like a piece of dirt practically by everyone.It is also important that Trelkovsky's plunge into madness occurs suddenly and very abruptly. It seems almost like a psychological breakdown and a rebellion at the same time. He has lived the life of conformity, compliance, and quite resentment, never able to stand his ground or even establish his individual sovereignty. Trelkovksy's meekness is simply striking. His sudden and violent obsession with not letting ""them"" make him into the previous occupant of the flat is a pathological and concentrated reaction to the years of pent up passive aggression and anger. The infernal scream at the end of the film is the wild shout of anguish. In a certain sense, the completely unexpected finale of the film presents a huge puzzle which is not really intended to be resolved. But Polanski seems to be investing it with important symbolic meaning. This world is full of multiple Trelkovskys, little, unnoticeable people terrorized by their own sense of total insignificance. This is a vicious cycle of dependence between people's unconscious yet compulsive cruelty to each other and the tortured compliance with this cruelty by others.This is an excellent, dark and captivating film in the best traditions of European psychological Gothic literature. I strongly recommend to watch this movie and take a look at Poe's, Hoffmann's and Gogol's stories.",The Tenant
1176,Love and Death,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0142389/,"For me Love & Death and Sleeper were Allen's zenith for slapstick, one-liner comic-gag comedy. After the relatively immature but amusing Bananas & Everything You always Wanted To Know About Sex, Allen goes up a notch in the intellectual comedy stakes to produce this fine send-up of Russian culture & historical caricature.Even though some of the one-liner jokes don't always come off it doesn't matter because you never really get chance to think too much about how droll it is because Allen has another half dozen gags waiting in the wings.But I've often found that Allen works best when he has a foil for his anarchic humour: and thank the Lord he managed to find the wonderful talent of Ms Keaton. She may not be his intellectual equal but she can run him to ground in nearly everything else. She has a kind of naive charm in this movie, always daydreaming, never really listening to Allen's mutterings & jabberings. And with this naivity brings warmth, humility and a general sense of well being.At the same time Allen can release all his pentup emotions, fears, neo-neurosis to Keaton knowing full well that she wouldn't have a single notion as to what he was on about.And thats what makes this partnership so durable whether it be here in Love & Death, or Sleeper, Annie Hall or Manhattan Murder Mystery. The scripts may vary but they're held together by the spontaneity of the two stars.It should be said also that Love & Death breaks new ground for Allen, because even though he still relies on the childish humour of his earlier films, it is also quite clear that he is more forthcoming with his angst against a problematic world. His philosophic nuances dominate a lot of the film, which he will put to more practical use in his latter films like Annie Hall & Manhattan. But here he gets the mix between jokes & existentualism just right.Love & Death is quite literally a laugh a minute. Whatever people may say about his recent personal problems it cannot be denied that this guy is a pure talent and should be cherished for what he is - a man that makes the world a happier place, if only for a few hours!****/*****",Love & Death

1178,The Taking of Pelham One Two Three,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2100352/,"Roller-coaster story about a quartet of mustachioed, eye-glassed, mack-wearing gunmen that heist a New York subway train - Pelham 1, 2, and 3 - in order to blackmail the city for one million in cash. We see the whole story from everyone's perspective: the gunmen, the victims, the cops, the mayor and his cronies, and, most importantly, from the transit authority police and various officials. This movie is one gritty film as New York is presented in all its 70s grandeur. Crime. Filth. Corruption. Yet, despite all this, the men serving the city work hard to protect the lives of those 17 passengers on Pelham 1, 2, and 3. At its roots this film is a story of two men - Mr. Blue(all the gunmen have color-coded names that Quentin Tarrantino borrowed in Reservoir Dogs)played with his usual aplomb by Robert Shaw as the leader of the gang and Walter Matthau as the Transit detective out to do what he can to remedy the situation. we get action, suspense, and some witty dialog as well as some subtle and not so subtle humor(loved the Matthau guest-touring scenes!). We also get drama with a real edge. The film like the situations it mimics feel explosive. There are some fine performances in here. Shaw, his voice is awesome, plays the evil, ruthless, and calm Mr. Blue to perfection. Martin Balsam and Hector Elizondo are very good as two other gunmen. Matthau is excellent and has always been overlooked for his dramatic value as an actor. Sure, he is funny in the film but it is a realistic kind of funny. it is like he is a real person - we call that acting I guess. Watch for Tony Roberts, Doris Roberts, Dick O'Neill, Jerry Stiller, and many other familiar faces throughout. I have not yet seen the remake, but the original will be hard to beat if for no other reason than it is a time capsule in its own right of a New York that no longer exists.",The Taking of Pelham One Two Three

Are these just maniacs without a plan? And if they do have a plan, how are they all going to escape alive while the world watches?Right away, this film grabs you and doesn't let go. Every character plays their role remakably and memorably. Enough suspense to keep you chewing your nails until they are stubs...and most of all, a realistic and engrossing storyline. You will literally be on the edge of your seat, wondering where the next plot twist will take you.You can easily see where Quentin Tarantino borrowed ideas from this movie to make Reservoir Dogs...and in my opinion, this film makes Reservior Dogs look like a second rate film. Its truly a shame most people aren't familiar with this movie and it doesn't have the allure or big star power to draw in new fans seeking out a great film to watchIf you happen to run across The Taking Of Pelham One Two Three though, do not pass it up!

1180,Serpico,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3488736/,"Al Pacino wasn't quite on fire as an actor when he made this film but he sure lit things up afterward. Fresh off his role as Michael Corleone in ""The Godfather"", Pacino broke new ground as an honest cop taking on the entire New York City Police Department in this unflinching look at police corruption in the five boroughs. You have to admire what the real life Frank Serpico must have gone through, I'm sure the picture only touched the surface of what he must have faced among fellow cops and superiors. More than anything, the story reinforced the idea that after just so long banging one's head against a wall, is there anyone at all you can really trust to get a message across. After all was said and done, Serpico got his gold shield at a point when it really didn't matter to him any more. Disillusioned, Serpico retired from the police force on June 15, 1972 and spent a decade recuperating and living in Switzerland and the Netherlands before returning to the States. Born in 1936, Frank Serpico turned eighty earlier this year as I write this.",Serpico
1181,Serpico,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0131523/,"When Frank Serpico joined the police force he was full of ideals and eager to help bring crime down in his neighbourhood.  He first encounters the corrupt side of his job when he is given an envelope of cash.  Even though he refuses to be part of the take, he finds that it goes too high for him to avoid or ignore.  Meanwhile, his colleagues, who already suspect him of being untrustworthy, begin to suspect him of trying to bring actions against the whole force.  As Scerpio lies bleeding from his head wound, he thinks back over his career.Having read the book several times, I was interested in seeing how such a tomb of a book was brought into a two hour movie. I was pleased to find that the answer to this question was `actually pretty well'.  The film manages to bring off the whole plot by giving the gist and delivering many of the book's most memorable scenes.  There is a problem with the story if you really like the book, but otherwise it works very well.  In fact the way each sequence is important means that the film moves very quickly - it's is often a downside if a film shirks on characterisation, but here it works to the film's favour.Part of the reason the script can get away with little character is that Pacino is really good.  He seems to have fallen into `who-ha' shouting of late, but here he has genuine passion and subtlety in his performance. The support cast includes Roberts, Randolph and others, but really it is Pacino's film and his performance reflects that.Overall this is a tragic true story and it is notable that the film doesn't end with the `and then' text.  There is no happy conclusion to the tale, the corruption that Serpico tried to confront and defeat remains in place after he is finished.  Despite this the film is exciting and dramatic as the story deserves.",Serpico

1183,Deliverance,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3140649/,"SPOILERS! My review is mostly meant for examination by those who have already seen the movie!As others have said this is a truly chilling and sinister film, many so called scary films lose their edge over the years by becoming dated, but this film feels sinister from the beginning and becomes almost unbearably oppressive to watch. Probably what makes it so chilling is the terrible events are entirely plausible.One reviewer here said that this film was about how violence (real violence) affects people, I won't repeat his review because he explains it more eloquently than I, but I totally agree.But interestingly enough as a woman it seemed to me that this movie was also examining masculinity but none of the male reviewers here have mentioned that, so I may be wrong. But I feel this way because it is noticeable to me how differently the men react, compared to women, to trauma. After the male rape not only is it never mentioned again but even initially when Ned is rescued it is not mentioned. I feel women would at least have a cry and hug each other first, but I may be wrong, because shock can manifest in different ways. However all of the men react in the same seemingly unemotional way, of course it is obvious that the men are traumatised by the event but their reaction is to protect their friend and fix the problem. And their way of fixing the problem is by not talking about it. Of course, part of the reason this event can't be discussed is because it is so emasculating. But their caring is obvious in little vignettes, for instance when Jon Voight helps Ned dress after the rape. Why men suppress emotions is something I have not always understood and at times has annoyed me, but this movie was such an insight for me, as I finally got it. We women know how to let out emotion safely, but men are so trained to suppress it that when it does happen it is often like a dam bursting then they can't control it, so it's safer to bottle it up.But the sad thing is though that their suppression will have terrible effects on them, this is one of the reasons therapists often say people shouldn't ""bury"" their problem (never was a metaphor so apt as in this film), however letting it out will make them crack, so they can't win, if they talk about it or suppress it, either way it will affect their sanity.Mind you even as a woman I could understand that many women would want to bottle up an event as traumatic as this one.Depressingly enough most movies when women get raped there is often something still ""sexy"" about the way it is shot but the male rape scene here is so sudden and so chilling you feel their helplessness and you know that if they aren't rescued that they will be killed and horribly, and you know they know this. Often rape reports deal with the violation but this scene really brings home to you the thought of not just the violation but the sheer terror that victims must feel, so I think this scene would be equally illustrative of what both men and women would experience.Even before the rape, it is obvious to me that all these men feel inadequate as men. Macho Lewis is over compensating, whiny Ned boasts about sexual conquests because he knows how unmanly he seems.So they want adventure (ie violence) so to transform themselves into real men, but ironically they don't understand that real violence isn't an adventure. Weirdly enough what should be considered emasculating, the horrible rape Ned experiences, is actually what transforms him into a real man, one who is scared but determined to survive and help his friends.Lewis almost does the opposite he goes from being the strong survivalist (though who undoubtedly saves them) to being terrified and in visible distress from his injury and helplessness.But I don't think the movie is saying that he is a coward. I think the movie shows them all as true human beings, they all show great courage at times but are also reduced to absolute terror at other times as anyone experiencing such horrors would. But that's part of the point is that you can not have true courage without real fear.So unlike the comic book heroes that they wanted to emulate, true heroism evolves from enduring terrible trauma.And it makes me wonder if perhaps one of the reasons that war veterans do not speak of war isn't just because of the horrors they saw but perhaps they are also ashamed of the times that they showed fear, no matter how courageous they may have been, deep down they may feel like cowards.The sad thing is that I think that the characters here will be forever traumatised and feel emasculated by what happened to them but the events were also the making of them as courageous heroes but they probably won't see it that way, but I had no doubt that Ned would go away being stronger, kinder and less brash to others and that Lewis would become more humble and that Jon Voight would appreciate his family more.This is one of the few movies I've seen adult male rape in, and society rarely mentions it too. I think issues such as this should be explored more in cinema, so that men who have experienced such terrible trauma can at least feel that the issue is being addressed in some way. Because let's face it part of the reason why Ned and the other characters can't speak about the rape is because society has deemed adult male rape to be an unspeakably shameful subject.",N/A

Why put so much effort into making peoples' lives harder? Another thing I don't understand is that, when a movie comes to be recognised as a 'classic', people automatically assume that if they don't like it it's their fault, not the film's.I suffer from no such humility. The French Connection is a turd. Like so many films of its era, it suffers from lousy character development, a wafer thin plot, and a ear-drum scratching score. (Seriously. Like nails on a blackboard.) Apologists will find no end of responses to these and myriad other criticisms, but I put it to you that it is not the audience's job to fill in the gaps in character and plot left by the writer and director.This is a film primarily about stupid people. Supercop Popye Doyle comes across as completely bumbling (as do many of his colleagues), and it is surely a rare hit-man that can fail to hit a stationary target using a tree (the trunk of which is thinner than the target) as cover. I could go on, but I would be wasting my time - you've already decided that I'm an idiot who is incapable of appreciating truly great cinema. This film is not 'challenging' or 'thought-provoking' (unless the thought is 'huh? THAT was the ending?'), it is dull.Never mind. I'll stick with Popeye the cartoon.",The French Connection
1185,The French Connection,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1070258/,"This is an intense, unremitting, intelligent and incredibly fast-paced film which blends action, cinematic realism, art and humor into a masterwork of hard-edged crime drama. But to categorize this film as drama, suspense or action really does violence to it. This is just a great film, and it doesn't fit comfortably into any category with which I am aware. Don't look here for any sense of fantasy-justice or n'er-do-wrong comic book heroism. Look here instead for gut wrenching nihilism, frustration with the unfairness of criminal justice in the hands of bureaucracy, and a solid, plot-driven story about a couple of cops who are just trying to do their jobs as best they can.And by all means, don't watch this film if you aren't fully awake and willing to be taken down the electric, ambiguous, and compelling roads it leads to. If you watch this film with any part of your brain turned off you'll end up asking questions like ""plot, what plot?"" The fact that some people can't find it reflects more on them as film-watchers than it does on this film. This film does not offer passive entertainment like most of the contemporary action market does. It makes you pay attention, though, at times you might not want to. Hackman and Scheider are incredible, with some of the greatest chemistry I have ever seen between two young actors. They play two hard-ass NYC detectives looking to end the war on drugs more-or-less permanently by taking down an international conspiracy which they have just barely sniffed out. And make no mistake, they, particularly Hackman's ""Popeye Doyle"" are at war, and treat their jobs as a battlefield. Doyle pursues his quarry with utterly wreckless abandon, endangering the lives of dozens of people along the way. While both men are absolutely terrific, this stands out as one of Hackman's greatest performances, and his Oscar is well-deserved (not something you will see me say often). Backed by a strong supporting cast, and some of the best live-action cinematography of the late 20th century, this film does not allow you to turn away, get popcorn, or even deal with bodily functions for its entire duration.Considered in the early 70s to be 'shockingly violent', this film does not even reach a tenth the degree of passive violent repulsion of the average Tarantino film, and it relies, instead, on amazing performances, flawless direction, a phenomenal post-modern soundtrack and edgy, tense camera-work. Unlike contemporary action film garbage, it also gives you complex characters who you can care about, but never fully understand. I will cut this review short because I am running out of superlatives.

Cute Monica Evans and Carole Shelley giggle their way through the film as 'Cecily and 'Gwendolyn' - the cuckoo 'Pigeon' sisters who live upstairs, and whom Felix later moves in with ( lucky guy ).Even now after all these years, certain moments can reduce me to tears of laughter - Felix interrupting Oscar in the middle of a ball game with a dinner request, Oscar cracking up and chasing Felix around the apartment, the Pigeon Sisters brought low by Felix's sob stories, and of course, the legendary cafeteria scene ( later ripped off by Nora Ephron's 'When Harry Met Sally' ).

Borgnine and Ryan also standout as adversarial superiors to Marvin.

Though she loves her husband, something stops her from going to bed with him. She is apparently troubled, and has erotic fantasies, with her husband always playing the bad guy - tormenting her. The director is very cunning in sprinkling some scenes from Severine's childhood which actually give a lot of clue regarding her troubled life. One such scene depicts her being abused by an elderly man (probably her father). This in my opinion is very revealing and makes our understanding of Severine's other actions/imaginations even better. She always considered herself impure, and was ashamed of letting her husband know that. This can be seen in one such sprinkler scenes where the girl Severine refuses to accept the holy offerings from the Father in the Church. And this scene is very aptly placed while Severine is found going up the stairs of the brothel to take up the job as a prostitute.Having been abused by an elderly man in her childhood, Severine, justifiably doesn't enjoy an young man's company in the bed (her husband). And she has erotic fantasies about going to bed with elderly clients at the brothel....again taking a job at the brothel is a fantasy and NOT real. This is very evident from the very funny, illogical incidents that take place in the brothel.Into her fantasies walks a young man and she had to please him on the bed at the brothel. While she lay on the bed, the young man notices a mark on her and queries her about it. When Severine says its just a birth mark (remember...this is analogous to the impurity she is carrying with her from her childhood), the young man initially rejects her (she thinks her husband would similarly reject her for her impurity) but finally gives in and enjoys her. Only then she realises that, the young man also bears a scar on his back, which he says is from a knife stab. She realises, everyone has a scar to be reconciled with in life. This gives her a great sense of relief and her attitude towards her husband slowly changes. In her fantasies, however, Severine sees a conflict between the young client and her husband, and that the young man kills her husband in a fit of rage, only to be killed in turn by the policeman. She ends the life of the young client in her fantasies. She confides in a family friend (who is actually shown as one more client at the brothel) and she is relieved that the husband knows the truth. This leads to a better understanding of her husband and a new relationship blossoms. Now, the husband, whom Severine thought was nothing but a crippled man, blind, and unyielding,she realises that she had in fact only imagined all that and puts an end to her fantasies, symbolised by the empty coach driven in the last scene.",Belle de Jour

When Henry proclaimed himself Head of Church, it was inevitable that the two men would clash. The origin conflict takes place when Catherine of Aragon was married to Arthur,Henry VII's older brother, Arthur died six months later, and Henry VIII marries to Catherine.Cardinal Wolsey(Orson Welles) failed to obtain the Pope's permission for Henry's marriage to Anne Boleyn and his fall was swift, he was summoned before Henry and forced to surrender his seal of office. Then Henry breaks with Catholic Church and secretly married Anne Boleyn and after creates Anglican religion. Thomas is led to council formed by Duke of Norfolk(Nigel Davenport), Archbishop Cranmer, Cromwell(Leo McKern) and Richard Rich(John Hurt). Later Moro is judged by the court, those who stood in Henry's way, even those he claimed to love, invariably ended on the scaffold.This splendid costumer-drama contains excellent performances by all star cast. Paul Scofield won deservedly Academy Award as upright chancellor with fateful destination but he was led from his cell in the Tower of London and beheaded. Outstanding Orson Welles at a brief appearance as Cardinal Wolsey and extraordinary plethora of secondaries as a young John Hurt, Wendy Hiller as his spouse Alice, Nigel Davenport as astute Duke of Norfolk, among others. And of course Robert Shaw as selfish King who discarded his first wife Catherine of Aragon and executed Anne Boleyn-Vanessa Redgrave in a very secondary role-. Colorful,luxurious scenarios by John Box with evocative cinematography by Ted Moore, also Oscar winner. The movie benefits from sensible and perceptible musical score by George Delerue.Brilliant direction by Fred Zinnemann who adapted perfectly Robert Bolt's screenplay.The story is remade in 1988, an inferior TV version directed and produced by Charlton Heston with John Gielgud as Cardenal Wolsey, again Vanessa Redgrave and Heston as Thomas Moro.",A Man for All Seasons
1193,A Man for All Seasons,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1017615/,"A Man For All Seasons is an erudite examination of the old Biblical maxim: a man cannot serve two masters. Sir Thomas More (poignantly portrayed by Paul Scofield) struggles to be true to both his faith and his monarch (the lusty and hearty King Henry VIII superbly played by Robert Shaw). I think it is difficult for citizens in our present secular society to truly understand just how central a role religion played in a man's life during the period of the film; it was an age of faith when Christianity exerted the most powerful of influences on one's thinking. On a side note, the American Republic wisely sought a nation that ""divided church and state."" However, the fine distinction remains that it would be a state informed by faith but not run by the church. The aforementioned exemplary performances by the leads are backed by excellent supporting turns, especially from Orson Welles as the less than saintly Cardinal Wolsey and the eternally ebullient Susannah York as Sir Thomas's daughter Margaret. This is a true masterpiece that richly deserves all the accolades and plaudits it has received.",A Man For All Seasons
1194,Repulsion,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1233342/,"The lovely lady's just not into it, fella. And she's got her reasons for flipping out. Anyone who's lived downstairs from some inconsiderate couple who can't be bothered to muffle their giggling and lovemaking, can relate to Carole's wanting to put a pillow over her head. Or theirs.It's not ""repression"" -- where do people get this idea Carole is somehow ""repressed"" for refusing unsolicited advances -- nor is it maladjustment, it's a normal response towards to people who behave like the world revolves around them and their sexual desires of the moment. Now, running around killing people, that's not a normal reaction. Or perhaps it is, if they are intruders like Colin and the lecherous landlord who physically assaults her, when you live in a society where that kind of abuse is the norm. That would be the point of Repulsion.I'm not really sure what more it would have taken for Polanski to hit home the point. There are no likable males in this picture. In fact, there are no sympathetic characters except for Carole. Her sister and and sad Briget, her colleague at work, are too enmeshed in their pushy, jerk boyfriends to think of anything or anyone else. Miss Balch tells it like it is and is unfortunately all too right about Briget's heart breaker boyfriend (but the mainstreamers, conventionalist/conformists, traditionalists and other males with an axe to grind will write her off as a woman embittered because she doesn't fit conventional beauty standards). Madame, Carole's boss, only cares about her inasmuch as her behavior affects business.These four female characters give clues as to what is supposed to be ""normal"" women's behavior in this film. They begrudginly endure slappy, brusque, unattractive creeps; complain about them to each other but do nothing whatsoever to alter their unhappy situations; impose them on roommates, unannounced and without consultation, as third roommates; it's as if Carole doesn't exist to these ""normal"" women, except as a go-fer and accessory. Not terribly different from the way the men in the film treat her. Handsome, impatient Colin isn't the red herring he would appear on first glance; he is jokingly advised by his friends to force her to give him what he is ""naturally"" entitled to, insistently breaking and entering her apartment when she has clearly been avoiding him. He deserved exactly what was coming to him. OK well maybe not outright murder, but let that be a lesson to the overzealous...Repulsion's only failure (and I consider it massive) is that it is apparently too subtle. Even for contemporary audiences, content to feign ignorance and repeat over and over that it's the sad tale of a ""repressed female"", complete with rape ""fantasies"". It isn't. It's a portrayal of a traumatized woman driven murderously crazy by ""normalcy"" and convention, imposed on her at every turn. Watch as a double feature with Chinatown (1974) or Fire Walk With Me (1992). 8/10.",Repulsion
1195,Repulsion,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1477758/,"Extremely shocking if you consider the time it was filmed!Carole, a beautiful, young, unusually shy, fragile, foreigner, works in a beauty salon and lives with her older sister Helene in London. Her behavior at first seems ""faintly strange"" and distant, but it appears like this is normal for everyone around her. Soon we realize she is antisocial and has a psycho-pathological fear of males and sex. When Helene leaves for a trip with her lover, Carole isolates herself in her sister's apartment and surrenders to her morbid fantasies that lead her down a path of hallucinations all the way to murder.Polanski uses ""the world outside"" in a clever way, to give us the whole parameter that helps bring about Carole's downfall. The social alienation a foreigner feels, the domination games and the self-interest of the people close to her. The men that approach her together with her own sexual fears, are all catalysts. They create the image of a threatening world and her helpless existence in it, as seen from inside her already troubled mind. Then begins a very true, detailed description of her problematic mind that slowly worsens into madness. Done in a natural and simple way and perhaps that is what makes it so haunting.The first part is purposely slow. A moment-to-moment reality that builds up tension and soon gives way to a nightmarish world. We watch as everyday reality transforms into a closed-door hell and as Carole transforms from ""strange"" into a clinical psychopath. The house becomes a character, its dimensions distorted and Carole is left there, to wander in it alone, with the house and the objects acting as symbols to portray exactly what is going on inside her head. (Everything symbolizes Carole's mental decline in parallel). Space becomes distorted. Time becomes distorted. She becomes distorted.The black and white makes you focus exactly where the director wanted and the visual effects are very limited compared to todays psychological thrillers. Here, the girl and the apartment are enough. The violence is not graphic it is psychological. Polanski's expert use of sound, sets, camera angles and framing all play a great role in creating the horror atmosphere.Deneuve is Fantastic! In a very difficult part (if you consider she plays alone and without dialogue most of the time) delivering an extremely complex role (her best performance to date) perfectly!! People have rushed to say she was ""flat"" but in this specific film, I believe that was the intention. The MIND is the protagonist here; she is only the vehicle where the mind lives. Her ""underplaying"" helps the viewer focus on what is happening inside her head, makes you follow her and go through the experience with her. If one decides to watch this film and not experience it, then yes, she looks hypnotized.By the time Helene and her boyfriend return, the viewer is just as shocked to have seen what the couple finds there. It is heartbreaking. The very last scene then finishes you off, perhaps giving the biggest clue. Revealing a secret as to why this has happened. And the way this scene is filmed leaves you with a chill in the spine. I became even more disturbed well after the movie was over and my thoughts had settled down. This is why I call this film an ""experience"".I think that some factors always needed when putting a ""value"" on films are often overlooked. Things like: Time of release, Level of difficulty in achievement of the story itself and Level of difficulty because of the budget or the country of production. Based on these, I think that Polanski has created masterwork. It could be considered very slow, especially for today's viewers. And for others it could even be considered a claustrophobic hell. In respecting everyone's personal opinions I would only recommend this to a specific audience and specific friends. Mostly ones who want to concentrate and allow themselves to be taken in by this type of film. For them, I am sure the experience will be rewarding.",Repulsion
1196,Zulu,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0087777/,"ZULU steers away from making one side good and one side bad.  Okay, we identify with the British troops in the face of insurmountable odds and all that - but you have to admire the ZULU warriors all the more for going up against them unfalteringly and the 'pan' across their fallen bodies isn't so much a moment of joy for the Brits saying ""Ha, look how many we've killed of you lot"" as opposed to clearly showing what an awful waste of life it all actually was.The film clearly marks out why the British Army was as good as it was. Organisation.  Okay, we got butchered a couple of times, but when placed in a position with time to ready ourselves the British forces where pretty unbeatable.  One of the huge advantages being the fact that often we were going up against quite primitive 'warriors' with even more primitive weapons.  The whole staying smart, obeying orders and keeping in line, firing in order helped to saved all those mens lives and is a neatly condensed show of arms to everybody out there.  Each setpiece of British organisation re-inforces just how good they were, just how well they were drilled and just how murderous they could be with their efforts.The film clearly marks out why the ZULU forces wasn't quite so good.  It wasn't a lack of courage or absence of valour, it was simply down to the fact that they were outclassed weapon and organisation wise.  Okay, they made pretty well organised charges and all that, but against rifles that's just cannon fodder.  But as is pointed out by the Dutch guy, they're merely counting your guns.  The ZULU's in the film aren't daft guys in furry underpants, they're the bravest warriors ever seen (or ever likely to be seen).  Well organised forces wilted in the face of British troops during that period, they didn't.  The fact they salute the British and walk away merely adds to their nobility and patheticises the British efforts - eventually they would have crumbled, the British would have lost against such odds if the Zulus had pressed all at once.  They didn't.  They walked away saluting the British effort.  That moment alone, with Caine blazing about how they're being taunted and the Dutch guy chuckling to himself struggling to believe what is actually taking place is the icing on the cake of the gradually increasing tension.For a moment of absolute spine tingling tension you can't beat the ZULU singing being countered by the Welsh Choir of voices.  It's an equaliser as such, a moment of contrast and compare between the rigid red suited Brits and the tribal shield clapping chanting.John Barry's music is a constant presence and always perfectly suited to the moment, I'd be interested to know the content of the ZULU chants though, whether they are authentic (which I figure they are) or simply picked out by the director for looking the most intimidating.Top film, no insult to anybody.",Zulu
1197,Goldfinger,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0085229/,"A great piece of escapism that has held up well thru the years as a tightly paced film and a standard by which other Bond films are often judged by. There are so many great scenes in this film that tickle me every time, when Bond outsmarts Goldfinger on the golf course, the Pussy Galore flying circus scenes, the scenes where the Mob bosses are eventually snuffed out, the Lincoln crushing scene because it's so outrageous to have crushed a new car, and the scene where Goldfinger gets pulled thru the plane's broken window to his demise, and many others. The classic theme as sung by the still great Shirley Bassey is a ""10""!!(I saw her perform recently in Atlantic City NJ and she is awesome!..only odd thing is she did every Bond theme she recorded except ""Goldfinger""..not sure why.) I have always enjoyed this film upon repeat viewings thru the years and always looked forward to it's occasional showing on Sunday night on ABC network in the years before video players were a common household item. I have always wondered about one scene in the movie if it's a mistake or not....when Bond and Goldfinger are fighting in the Plane for the gun and the gun goes off, there is a long shot of Bond grabbing hold of one of the plane's seats as Goldfinger is flying toward the broken window..but I swear there is a person lying in the isle on the floor near Bond!?? If this is so, who is it supposed to be? A person who got knocked out when debris started flying? Is it the Asian hostess that spied on Bond when he was on board the last time? It's such a quick shot I swear my eyes are fooling me! I hope someone can answer my question!",Goldfinger
1198,The Birds,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3127909/,"I know this movie is often described as a ""masterpiece"" and for the life of me, I don't understand why.First of all: the acting is completely wooden from virtually everyone in the movie. It could be that the actors could find no motivation for their characters. Whatever is supposed to be happening or building between the characters in the first half of the movie seems to lead to absolutely nothing int he movie. It's vague back story for the sake of back story. If Hitchcock was trying to have us care about the characters, he failed miserably. Second, and perhaps most important: what do the birds have to do with any of this vapid soap opera that is occurring on the ground? Nothing. Nothing at all. And that would be fine, if somehow the bird frenzy created some sort of empathy in the viewer or brought about a change or revelation in the characters. But no, I found myself not caring if the whole town got eked to death. The characters all come across as shallow, self-centered, bitter people.I know I might get the wrath of many fans of this movie. But, sorry, this movie fails on so many levels.",N/A
1199,Cape Fear,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4045001/,"Robert Mitchum is at his creepy best here, playing a villain than can easily rival his antagonist in ""The Night of the Hunter"". Mitchum is memorable as Max Cady, an ex-con who has never forgiven lawyer Sam Bowden (Gregory Peck) for helping to put him behind bars for eight years. Now the ex-con is back, and is determined to constantly harass Sam & his family (Polly Bergen as wife Peggy, Lori Martin as daughter Nancy). Cady has something especially insidious planned for the females. It isn't long before Sam believes that his nemesis is capable of anything, and is resorting to desperate measures to remove this threat from his life.""Cape Fear"" is one of the all-time great black & white thrillers to come out of Hollywood, boasting a sharp script by James R. Webb, that is based on the novel ""The Executioners"" by John D. MacDonald. It may indeed lack the explicitness of later Hollywood films, but that actually adds to its power. What it suggests is already pretty powerful.Overall, it has a very Hitchcockian feel, and in fact was scored by frequent Hitch collaborator Bernard Herrmann (one of the composers' most haunting and unforgettable soundtracks) and cut by George Tomasini, who'd edited ""Psycho"". It marks one of the absolute best efforts for the director J. Lee Thompson (""The Guns of Navarone"").It's clear early on that Cady is the more interesting role. As vile as he is, he has an unpleasantly sly, savvy quality about him, only enhanced by the fact that he's spent his time in stir studying up on the law. Now he knows just how much he can get away with in the name of making Sams' life a living Hell. And he has a man in his corner, a grandstanding attorney played by the great character actor Jack Kruschen.In comparison, Sam is an ideal role for Peck, what with his All-American, model of decency type of character. And he becomes more intriguing as he relents and starts taking those desperate measures, like hiring some local toughs to try to gang up on Cady.Not much is done with the wife and daughter roles; they're mostly just required to be stand around and be scared. But Bergen and Martin are appealing in their performances.In addition to Kruschen, other notable cast members include Balsam (who, of course, played Arbogast in ""Psycho""), Telly Savalas, Barrie Chase, Paul Comi, Page Slattery, and Edward Platt. But Mitchum towers over everybody with a performance of pure smarm and menace.The finale is genuinely gripping stuff: it's quite tense and very atmospheric.Famously remade by Martin Scorsese in 1991, with interesting new layers to the story, but an ultimately more over the top nature, with Robert De Niro's version of Cady coming off like a cartoon bogeyman.Eight out of 10.",Cape Fear

Cady blames Bowden for his 8 years imprisonment because the lawyer failed to get him an innocent verdict in Court for a serious crime he was accused of (and he had committed). The man starts by stalking Bowden and his family while he waits for the appropriate moment to make his move. In the meantime, Cady does not hide his intentions and Bowden knows perfectly well they are in big trouble.The film is tense all along and interest doesn't fall at any moment. There is a correct direction by J. Lee Thompson, a slightly more than average director who probably did here one of his best jobs (the other one ""The Guns of Navarone"" (1962) a very entertaining World War II adventure). Black and white shooting was a good idea and helps to create some sort of sordid and dark atmosphere when required as well as the musical score.Casting is very good too. Gregory Peck is correct in one of his many common good guy roles. Polly Bergen is believable as the frightened wife and there is also good acting by Martin Balsam (as Bowden's chief of police friend) and Telly Savalas (as a private detective hired to help the family). But the major credit in this issue goes without doubt to Robert Michum's performance as the dangerous avenger. He looks calm and quiet -with few exceptions- all the way to the final climax sequences but you know perfectly the man is real mean and deadly. This surely was one of Mitchum's best appearances in his long film carrier.The 1991 Cape Fear version with Robert de Niro -although a watchable movie- is not as good and thrilling as this one where evil doesn't appear clearly till the end but menace is always there.A very good thriller indeed!",Cape Fear
1201,The Magnificent Seven,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1179788/,"Sometimes you just want to read a review by a regular guy who is not pretending to be a professional movie critic. Forget about comparisons of this movie to its story-line inspirational predecessor. (Aren't most movies a reinterpretation of some story already told before?)At first, ""The Magnificent Seven"" seems to be simple: good guys versus bad guys. As the story unfolds, the audience learns that not all good guys are good all the time, and that not all bad guys are bad all the time. There are many references to the duplicity of all men--how the ""good"" guys and ""bad"" guys are similar in many ways. It is the complicated human condition that makes the viewer empathize with both sides. In the end, each character gets what they deserve--in the big scheme of things. This is very satisfying viewing for the audience.Watch this movie for still being entertaining and moving after forty-five years; for its strong individual characters by ""tough guy"" actors when they were young; for the AMAZING iconic score which captures the once free-spirit of the American West; for just being a good and satisfying movie.",The Magnificent Seven
1202,Eyes Without a Face,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3115330/,"This picture has the look and feel of an American made Forties or Fifties horror flick but it's actually a French film made in 1960 and directed by Georges Franju. I don't know what single word might best describe it, but the one that immediately comes to mind is creepy. Everything about the picture tends to horrify the viewer, established with the opening scene as we see the images of passing skeletal trees against a sky of night time darkness. We learn that a middle aged woman (Alida Valli) is on her way to dispose of a body in a nearby river, another failed experiment at the hands of a gifted surgeon named Genessier (Pierre Brasseur). From there, things take an even more frightening turn, as the story explores Genessier's obsession to restore the face of his daughter, horribly disfigured in a car crash for which he was responsible.The story uses some of that pseudo-scientific babble I love to come across in these types of films, that stuff about a 'heterograft', whereby radiation is a requirement to biologically modify a host body to receive a donor transplant. Because radiation is too intense in the required dosage, exsanguination is deemed the next best available strategy for the type of procedure explained by Professor Genessier to his attentive audience. Funny, but none of that was going on when the good professor got down to the real nitty gritty of his work on daughter Christiane (Edith Scob).You know, it's hard to describe, but there was something of an ethereal beauty in both the masked and newly engineered face of Christiane following the operation. Didn't you think for a moment that the new face of Christiane would be that of victim Edna Gruber (Juliette Mayniel)? Instead, you had this beautiful face appear, rather astonishingly to convey success for the questionable transplant operation. It's best described by the professor - ""There's something angelic about you now"" in a cautious appraisal of his daughter's beauty. However things take a disastrous turn as the operation proves fruitless; the girl's body rejects the new face and the mask is required once again.But you know what I found to be truly outrageous? What was with that police scheme to insert Paulette Merodon (Beatrice Altariba) into the professor's den of horror? There didn't seem to be any control in place to monitor the girl's movements, and she could have been another goner in the doctor's twisted scheme of things.Well I don't know if modern day viewers of a young age would be affected by the story as much as I was. I think the real terror for them would be watching Christiane use that ancient contraption known as a dial telephone. And then, as if to totally confuse the present day techie, boyfriend Jacques has to answer the phone without benefit of caller ID. Oh, the horror! Well in any event, I thought this film was a genuine creepfest, heartily recommended to genre fans, particularly as I mentioned earlier, to fans of classic horror films of the Forties and Fifties where the mad scientist reigns. In iconic fashion, the evil doctor gets his in the end here, as we learn the answer to that age old question - who let the dogs out?",Eyes Without a Face

Instead, it relies on suspense, action, impending doom, and a completely eery atmosphere to succeed. The slow buildup, in which the entire town is take over by monsters who emanate from giant pods and take over the bodies of the real people, works extremely well in this film. The cast, featuring a terrific but restrained performance by Kevin McCarthy, is excellent. The surprise ending, featuring an ironic twist caused in part by California freeway traffic, is excellent.

1205,Rebel Without a Cause,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2122666/,"With short, slicked-back hair, blue eyes and thick red lips, and dressed in a white T-shirt, blue jeans, and bright red jacket, James Dean creates a lasting visual impression as youthful Jim Stark, the prototype high school outsider, alone and troubled. Dean's on-screen persona, together with his vivid, intense performance, overwhelms all other elements in this film about 1950s teenage confusion and angst.Newly arrived in town, Jim Stark finds himself trapped in a typically hostile high school, and confronted by an in-crowd of leather-jacketed hoods with names like ""Buzz"", ""Crunch"", and ""Goon"". They challenge Jim's honor by calling him ""chicken"". What to do? Jim asks his weak, mealy-mouthed father (well played by Jim Backus). But his father is no help. Indeed, the film conveys a grim view of adults: self-indulgent, weak, insensitive, unobservant, and inept.Then there's ""Plato"" (Sal Mineo), the high school kid who has always been alone, with no apparent father or mother. In Jim Stark, Plato has finally found a friend. Eventually, another student joins Jim and Plato. Judy (Natalie Wood) changes her caddy behavior toward Jim after an event changes her life. But it's still a hostile world, and the bond that these three young people form, as substitute family, is fleeting, en route to a poignant ending.The film's characters and thematic tone are representative of a Cold War era in America when the threat of nuclear annihilation hovered over everyone and everything like the sword of Damocles. And thus, the story's astronomy motif amplifies a sense of loneliness, insignificance, isolation, and helplessness, so characteristic of the 1950s.There are things about this film I do not care for. The compressed widescreen projection in ""CinemaScope"" is annoying. The music, which varies from jazz to rhythm and blues to nondescript noise, is too loud and too manipulative. And there's something vaguely contradictory about a macho James Dean in the role of Jim Stark, whom bullies pick on.But none of these irritations can diminish the thematic depth of the story. Nor can they diminish the overpowering presence of James Dean, the actor, the perfect Hollywood symbol of youthful ""cool"", whom actors subsequently looked to as a model of acting excellence and cinematic charisma.",Rebel Without a Cause
1206,The Ladykillers,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0055296/,"OK so I like it.  Why? Well it is that intoxicating combination of dry black humour, pathos and perhaps a pleasing inevitability that whatever twist the film takes, you know it should be no other way.I cannot fault the cast, I regretted as a kid that I did not see Katie Johnson again (I know she made many other films, but I have never collided with them), whereas Alec Guinness and Peter Sellers were often featured on a Saturday Matinee.I am, however, pleasantly surprised at how well this film is rated by IMDb! Of course I would give it high marks, but it is very interesting to see how many other people from other nations both 'get it' and appreciate it.  It is perhaps, these days, just a gentle farce with black edges where naivety blends in with irony, and I am not claiming that it makes me LoL the whole time.

1208,Sabrina,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1526818/,"Although it's more of a feminine word, and not one which I normally use - this movie is one which I would describe (in addition to ""superb"") as ""delightful."" Humphrey Bogart made a few more films prior to his death, in his 50's, a little over two years after this movie was released. He was the type of actor (like Nicholson and Redford today), for whom aging did not provide any obstacle, in terms of needing a radical change in his roles -- and we all missed a great deal by his being felled by cancer, without the many additional films he would otherwise have made.The three leads - Bogart, accompanied by Audrey Holden and William Holden, are perfect in their roles. They are throughly engaging in whichever of the three permutations any two are together, as well as when all three are on-screen at the same time.The three primary supporting actors - Bogart's and Holden's wealthy parents, and Hepburn's chauffeur father, are very likable and their parts well-played. The remainder of the supporting cast is excellent, as well.The enjoyment of this film is in no way dependent on any real suspense - the outcome is no surprise, and most of the ongoing events predictable. This is one of those stories where the pure charm of the actors and characters, and a wholly-engaging story stand by themselves for its success.This is also an outstanding nostalgic piece for the film and life styles of the 1950's, and as a memorial to three of movie history's most remembered and honored ""A"" list personalities.(Since I first saw this film, viewing it again also has a special enjoyment for me, During the latter 1980's - early 1990's, my company employed a marketing consultant for several projects. His office was in the building at 30 Broad St., in New York City. This is the same building actually used in this picture, and with a special sign made for the film, was ""The Larabee Building,"" with the family's home offices. I had occasion to visit my colleague, a native New Yorker, there, many times - as well as seeing a lot of the city as you can enjoy with persons like him and his wife, lifelong, well-connected city residents.)",N/A
1209,Sabrina,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0053024/,"The master of many genres, Billy Wilder, does his magic here with this delightful comedy. Although maybe not one of his best, it still holds up after over 50 years. There has been a lot said about the casting of Bogart as Linus, the stuffy businessman and I disagree with most of it. I think that Bogart is perfect for the part of the seemingly humourless, financial wizard older brother. Granted, he is not the prettiest actor....never was.....he's a generation older than Audrey Hepburn.....and reportedly hated the movie and his co-stars. All that aside, he rose to the occasion and his playing of the role is subtle. Seeing him come to the realization that he is falling in love with Sabrina is so well done that it sneaks up on you.Audrey Hepburn is just magical, as she always was.....there is nothing more to say about her....words fail me.William Holden is surprisingly good in a comic role but why the blonde hair?He's breezy, unreliable and thoroughly likable and it becomes obvious that Sabrina is much too good for him. However incongruous it may seem, she belongs with Bogart.The support in this film is top notch.....John Williams....what a great British character; Walter Hampden is a scream as the drinking, cigar smoking father who just wants an olive for his martini. Look for Nancy Kulp as one of the service staff before her days as Jane Hathaway on Beverly Hillbillys.This is a wonderful film........watch it, you won't regret it!",Sabrina
1210,The Quiet Man,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0047626/,"The Quiet Man is a wonderfully layered and at times hilariously ironic portrayal of Ireland as seen by an American.For those who doubt the film's sense of irony, just re-watch the scene where Sean (John Wayne) paints the door of his cottage. The Vicar's wife remarks on its beauty and in a deadpan manner suggests ""only an American would have thought of Emerald Green"". Only an American (or a foreigner), is the implication, would think that the picturebook Ireland they are seeing in this film is a realistic portrayal of a lived experience of the country. An Irish person would have painted the door red, she says. It weathers better that way.The film takes ideas of Irishness and exaggerates them to brilliant and comic effect. The drinking Mickaleen, the patriarchal rule, the idyllic countryside. But beneath the Oirish exterior is a sharp intelligence and a subversion of what the film at first glance seems to suggest.Beneath the idyllic countryside are elemental forces that are waiting to be disturbed, as we see in the two scenes where Sean and Mary-kate kiss. Storm clouds fill the sky and the wind whips about them. The countryside which previously seemed so welcoming is now tempestuous and threatening. Theirs are passions which do not fit in the comic book world which we have previously seen. Yet they exist.The portrayal of women, and particularly Sean's treatment of Mary-Kate when he drags her through the field is not so oppressive as it might seem. Remember that it is her who insists on receiving her dowry, who equates her possessions to her worth. It is she who forces Sean to act the way he does and fight Will Danaher. She indoctrinates him into her society by threatening to leave him. She withholds the marital bed. Sean eventually becomes the man she wants him to be.In short this is a portrayal of Irish, or more importantly, rural life that is very much from the point of view of the outsider. Of the city folk. Yet it always acknowledges that and has great fun playing with its stereotypes. Its funny, its romantic, it appeals to the part of us that yearns to live a simple life away from the complex world, much as we know that life does not exist. Enjoy it!",The Quiet Man
1211,The Day the Earth Stood Still,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0044491/,"When a space ship lands in the middle of a playing field in Washington, the military respond with an immediate shut down of the area.  The inhabitant of the space ship exits bearing a gift, but is shot by soldiers mistaking it for a weapon.  Seconds after the shot a large robot exits and destroys all the weapons.  The alien, Klaatu, is taken to a hospital and asks for an audience with all the world leaders.  When he is refused, he escapes the hospital and takes a room in a small guest home incognito.  The man hunt starts as Klaatu seeks to deliver his message to earth and avert disaster.In a sea of 1950's sci-fi this film easily stands out as a classic that gave so much to popular culture  the score alone has been aped (or lifted in the Simpson's case) in many other films.  The plot is very different to the others of the period as it is a peaceful message it sends, rather than a `beware the red menace' message of fear and hate.  In fact one character even says she thinks the `alien' is from earth (ie Russia) only to be hushed!  The film lacks action but makes up for it with a solemn mood and genuine thoughtfulness as Klaatu learns more about humans and tries to reconcile what he sees with what he sees in the wider world as a whole.In recent hindsight it is impossible not to look at Klaatu's warning of `disarm or we'll remove your threat by destroying you' in the same light. Isn't this the same warning and actions that Bush and Blair made recently? I'll leave you with that thought but I found it difficult to understand Klaatu's pre-emptive strike, while holding a critical view of Bush's.That aside the film's production is very polished.  The score is excellent and really gives the film an alien feel to it.  The direction makes use of ordinary sets to good effect  the very idea of the space ship landing in Washington is obvious, but to have it land on a baseball field is a clever way to show it striking (sorry  accidental pun) at the heart of ordinary America.  The cast do well and mostly rise above the clichés set by the genre.  Rennie does good work as Klaatu and Neal is more than just a screamer as Helen.  Of course we have to have a wide-eyed all American boy (Bobby, but it could easily be Johnny or Jimmy) to see the whole thing, but he does OK.Overall this is a classic of the genre that has passed on so much to modern audiences.  The pacifist message is refreshing when viewed along side so many other of the period which used the aliens to warn against the spread of communism, but the ease with which you now accept Klaatu's threat of a pre-emptive strike will depend on your political views over the past few months.",The Day the Earth Stood Still
1212,The Day the Earth Stood Still,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0044511/,"THE DAY THE EARTH STOOD STILL is such a basic Science Fiction story that many first-time viewers have been stunned by the reverence in which it is held. An alien arrives on earth, is misunderstood and is nearly killed, passes a warning to mankind to not carry the weapons of potential nuclear war into space, or face annihilation, then leaves. The FX are minimal, there are no 'space battles' or 'monsters', even the score, by the legendary composer Bernard Herrmann, is simple, lacking the bombast of later 'epics'. Yet in it's very simplicity, director Robert Wise has created a tale more timeless and relevant than many other 'message'-driven SF blockbusters that followed.Based on Harry Bates' short story, ""Farewell to the Master"", which paints a far less friendly view of our galactic community (Gort, the enforcer robot, is revealed to be the true 'Master' of the story, not Klaatu, thus revealing that machines are controlling the Universe), 20th Century Fox and director Wise quickly butted heads on how the film should be presented. Fox envisioned Spencer Tracy as Klaatu, believing that the legendary star's well-established persona would make the SF elements more 'understandable' to audiences. Wise scoffed at the notion, arguing that no one would ever believe Tracy was an alien, and searched until he found relative newcomer Michael Rennie, a gaunt, sensitive British actor, whom he felt best suited the Christ-like quality Klaatu had to possess (even the name Klaatu adopted to mingle with humans was 'Carpenter'). For earth's greatest scientist (a thinly-disguised Albert Einstein), Wise cast screen veteran Sam Jaffe, which also brought a howl from the studio, as the actor was being investigated by the House Un-American Activities Committee, in the midst of their infamous 'witch hunt' and blacklisting of Hollywood's supposed Communist sympathizers. Jaffe proved a perfect choice, however, displaying many of the qualities he would later bring to 'Dr. Zorba' on ""Ben Casey"".
Rounding out the cast were popular actress Patricia Neal (still recovering from her failed relationship with Gary Cooper), Hugh Marlowe (fresh from the success of ALL ABOUT EVE), and Billy Gray (who would go on to great success in ""Father Knows Best""). The true casting coup, however, was finding 7-foot Hollywood doorman Lock Martin to portray the robot, Gort. Encased in foam rubber 'armor' and 'lifts', to bring his height to nearly eight feet (he actually wore two different outfits, as the seam was impossible to hide, and would always have to be on the opposite side to the camera), Martin, who, Wise acknowledged, was not a physically strong man, would occasionally faint from heat exhaustion (if you watch him carefully, during the film, you can actually see moments when he would start to tilt over). The scene where he carries Neal on board the spacecraft was a major achievement for the easily tired giant, and the actress, who was afraid, justifiably, that she might be dropped!The filming was, by and large, an enjoyable experience for the cast and crew (although Patricia Neal, in later interviews, said that it was nearly impossible for her to say the film's famous 'tag' phrase, ""Klaatu Barrada Nikto"", without breaking into giggles). Everyone knew the end result would be special; Michael Rennie, ten years later, would call the role the most ""important"" of his career (NBC would even bring him in to host the network premiere of the film, on ""Saturday Night at the Movies"").With it's anti-war stand, the film was the direct counterpart of the year's other 'classic' SF production, THE THING FROM ANOTHER WORLD, the first of Hollywood's 'alien invasion' films. In THE DAY THE EARTH STOOD STILL, 'Mankind' is the true monster, toying with nuclear weapons, constantly fighting, and willing to kill a peaceful emissary, without allowing him to deliver his message or offer his gifts to the world. ""Man must grow up, or be destroyed"" was a powerful message, in 1951, particularly when Wise panned his camera over Arlington Cemetery, with it's thousands of headstones, as Klaatu/Carpenter viewed, sadly, the end result of our fixation with warfare.The message is even more relevant, today, which is why THE DAY THE EARTH STOOD STILL remains a classic.",The Day the Earth Stood Still
1213,The African Queen,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0043959/,"This is one of those films whose special effects and scenery must have been astounding at the time (1951), but which seem mediocre at best today. BUT, and that's a big 'but', this does not detract from the greatness of the movie overall. The scenery truly is beautiful, for one thing--and the direction and cinematography is great. However, what truly makes this film a classic, and deservedly so, is the performances given by the lead actors. For their one film together, Humphrey Bogart and Katharine Hepburn pull out all the stops. Bogart is crude, dirty and a low-life river-rat with a heart of gold. He gives the Oscar-winning performance of his lifetime. Hepburn is prim and prissy, but always manages to win us over with her radiance and vulnerability, as well as that core of steel and strength she lends to all her on-screen characters. He's charming, in his way; she's achingly beautiful in hers. You can't help but warm to Charlie and Rosie, and truly, genuinely root for them to get together.
The ending is predictable; all 'opposites-attract' romance adventure stories are. You know without a doubt that the sunset will be there for Charlie and Rosie to ride off (or swim) into together. But you still hurt when Charlie hurts; and you still smile like a fool when he sees Rose, and when he tries to explain her forthrightness away by jungle fever. You believe the love, and that's what the African Queen is all about.Oh, and the gin and leech scenes, of course. Those are brilliant, as everyone else here has already mentioned! ;)",The African Queen
1214,Gilda,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0034139/,"Rita Hayworth is GILDA, the mysterious sex-bomb who slinks into the life of casino owner Ballin Mundson (George MacReady) and his right-hand man Johnny Farrell (Glenn Ford). It's pretty evident that Gilda and Johnny share a turbulent past, and their love-hate relationship (there has probably never been a screen relationship since that so perfectly encapsulated both sides of that equation) traps them both in a web of mutual brinkmanship... both trying to prove they 'hate' the other more. There is the complication of Gilda's marriage to Mundson, of course, as Johnny tries angrily to keep her faithful to Ballin, and the plot twists that unfold, leading Gilda to marry Johnny after Ballin's 'suicide' and his subsequent psychological tormenting of her. All in all, GILDA is a film-noir whose plot is almost an open book--the foreshadowing that goes on here is hardly what one would call subtle. You're hit on the head with the plot twists to come and know what to expect. It's the psychological creations of Gilda and Johnny that are interesting, with Gilda especially being an intriguing character.Rita Hayworth is without a doubt the best thing about the film: she's sexy, gorgeous, and sizzles whenever she's onscreen, from her guitar-strumming rendition of 'Put The Blame On Mame' through to that famous reprisal in the black dress and elbow gloves. (Her not-quite-striptease is hotter than most sex scenes in films these days!) It's not just about the looks though--her dramatic moments are a treasure to watch as well, particularly when she discovers that she has been tricked into returning to Buenos Aires. The moment when she breaks and slaps and scratches and screams at Johnny before sliding down to his feet, defeated, is an amazing emotional display. (Given more impact by her immediate reappearance onstage in the casino's club.)An interesting film for the characters (though Mundson turned out to be too one-note to be anything other than a caricature), and an excellent performance from Hayworth. You might want to look elsewhere for a better plotline though!",GILDA
1215,Gilda,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0034135/,"The 40s and 50s produced many alluring performances from beautiful and sexy actresses and Rita Hayworth's in Gilda is one of the most provocative of all.  The film is good and quite deep, the male leads are better, but Hayworth's performance is simply stunning and unforgettable.  She may not have been the most beautiful 40s actress (Gene Tierney and Veronica Lake were more classic beauties imo), but if you look closely her ability to show the sweet, the vulnerable, and especially the wanton, in women has not been bettered.  Somehow her character gets under the male viewer's skin in the same way as it does to the male characters in the film.Modern film femme fatales are a pale shadow by comparison, for example Linda Fiorentino or Sharon Stone.  I'm not sure why.  It could be either that nowadays allure is too much equated with sex or nudity (less tantalising than several dashes of suggestion) or maybe it's that present day equivalents are portrayed as hard as nails without the necessary mix of sadness and vulnerability.Whatever, if you've never appreciated what the appeal of 40s noir is, this is definitely one to try.",Gilda
1216,Fantasia,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0957423/,"This unusual and very creative classic of animation combines a very interesting idea with quite a bit of imagination, plus visual effects that still hold up quite well. All but a couple of the sequences are quite enjoyable, and some especially so. Even the segments that don't work as well are usually at least interesting, since you can at least appreciate what they were trying to accomplish.You don't really have to be all that familiar with the specific pieces of music for it to be worthwhile, since in several cases they chose to match the music with material that is rather different in nature from any original context that it may have had. And in any case, the animated sequences are intended to provide the context, in terms of the movie.No doubt, everyone will have his or her own favorite segments, based on the music itself and on the choice of accompanying visual material. The ""Sorcerer's Apprentice"" sequence, with Mickey Mouse, is certainly one of the most memorable. The adaptation of ""The Rite of Spring"" is quite imaginative in using an entirely different setting for the music. ""Night on Bald Mountain"" has striking and sometimes bizarre visuals.Many of the classic Disney features still hold up well as family entertainment, but ""Fantasia"" is unique for its combination of imaginative concept and visual creativity. Not every minute of it works, but that's the price of being willing to experiment. It's an enjoyable and satisfying feature that well deserves to be remembered.",Fantasia

1221,Loveless,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4359338/,"Severe and un-melodramatic portrayal of a couple who's at each other's throats and are desperately finalizing their divorce, where both are reluctant in looking out for the best interest of their 12-year-old kid, whom they consider more of a hindrance to their own separate paths to happiness. It's the feeling of awfulness and marvel in seeing the beauty and the nastiness of humanity that occur in such a cold, stark environment which leaves a lasting impression to the viewer. With shot compositions that never for once looks contrived, effortless in photographing the quotidian scenery, it overwhelms, suffocates and unnerves the viewer by reminding that the onset of the winter season also reflects the bitterness the kid will have to face with the disintegration of his only known family. The film focuses on Maryana Spivak (Zhenya) and Aleksey Rozin (Boris), who both did a stupendous job in capturing the varying degrees of steely disposition that overflows on such narcissists, way too consumed of the image that they would project to the people that surround them yet lacks the basic empathy to their own flesh and bone, Alyosha (Matvey Novikov in a heart-wrenching performance). But such uncaring demeanor as parents contrasts with that of the upright response shown by a few of their friends and complete strangers in manifesting the spirit of volunteerism. Decent performances from the supporting actors, apart from Natalya Potapova playing Zhenya's mother who almost steals the film with just a single scene in displaying such dreadfulness that rivals that of the irreconcilable couple, each and every one of them gives subdued and understated performances that's much like the way the strategically used minimalist musical score penetrates the background, and the way those inconspicuous brooding scenes transitions to yet another inconspicuous brooding scene. Zvyagintsev's decision to end the film in an ambiguous note, just utter perfection, not wanting to petrify or shatter the viewer's feelings after witnessing a tragic story. It's the speculation of what the ending signifies that leaves a much more menacing outcome, and it should, (At least, that's how it worked for me), for people to have a more determined resolve in withstanding hardships that life has to offer because, the thing is, the end will never be nigh.

In 2013, I, my wife and my stepdaughter went to Orlando in vacation, was a ""dream comes true"" trip, we all are born in a poor family in Brazil, and can do that was really a dream come true. Everything in USA was amazing and we come back Brazil thinking ""there is no poverty in USA, everything works, the things are cheap!"".The poor people in Brazil live in not well done houses, in favela, near polluted rivers or very crowded neighborhoods. This movie show us where the poor people live in Orlando, conventily in cheap hotels (conventily to the ones that earn money from tourism). Just to you know the difference between the countries, in Brazil is impossible a poor family live in a cheap hotel, no way, this is very expensive.Many user reviews here, especially the lower ratings, takes the point of view of the mother, saying that ""she not a good mother"", ""why she dont work?"" and many other things. They say the movie protect this kind of people and becouse of this they are very disappointed.I say that all these people don't understand the movie, let´s take only the point of view of Moonee, she have a super mom for her. She can play all day with her friends, walk way in many places, eat icecream for free, and do stupid things, and if anyone go to your mother to complain about her, her super mom will make they go away. Moonee really love this.You can say that this is wrong, I don't agree to that kind of comportament, but the movie is showing to us one point of view, you don´t need to agree with it, but you need to see it.Just think about Moonee life, she love it, everything is good, everything is a party.

1223,Just Mercy,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5419460/,"I came away disappointed by the film adaptation of Just Mercy. This is probably a given, but the film adaptation is very overly-dramatized, and not completely true to the story. While this is expected, I find it in this case to be in somewhat poor taste considering everything is a portrayal of real-life people and real-life events.Having read the book, you would see that the racism that actually took place was seriously watered down for the film adaptation. The film also touches on things from the book briefly but not enough to give you the entire picture or depth of the situation. For example, the film also briefly follows Herb, who is being executed for murdering a girl. While the film touches on his PTSD and having been a veteran, and ""making a bomb"", the film doesn't explain, like the book did, that it was illegal for the state of Alabama to execute Herb because he had no intention of killing anyone (he made the bomb as part of a convoluted plan to ""rescue"" his old girlfriend and win her back, but instead the bomb killed her young daughter). The state of Alabama executed him anyway after Stevenson's last minute appeal because it was ""too late"".In the movie, Herb also has ""no family"" and gives his flag to Stevenson. In real life, he was surrounded by family, including a new partner who refused to give him up when he had to be taken away to be executed (by the way, his execution in the film is just a simple ""thud"").I also found Jamie Foxx's portrayal of Walter McMillian to be wildly inaccurate. In the movie, he blows up upon first meeting Stevenson, and comes off as someone who is nonchalant about life at Holman Correctional Facility and knows everything about the decorum there. He even refuses Stevenson's services at first. In real life, Walter was traumatized by the conditions at Holman and during his case was desperately seeking Stevenson's attention over that of his fellow inmates.There are several critiques I have for the film, but I don't want to spoil the central story. I strongly recommend you read the book instead, because you will walk away from it with a much more thorough understanding of our criminal justice system and what's really going on in America.",Just Mercy

1225,Gifted,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3679527/,"Greetings again from the darkness. The ""right"" choice isn't always obvious. Things get more complicated when even the ""best"" choice isn't clear. Place a young child at the heart of that decision tree, and the result may yield emotional turmoil and an abundance of moral high ground and judgment. Such best intentions are at the core of this latest from director Marc Webb (his first feature since 500 Days of Summer) and writer Tom Flynn.Frank (Chris Evans) is raising his 10 year old child prodigy niece Mary (Mckenna Grace) in low-key small town Florida. The circumstances that brought the two of them together aren't initially known, but are explained in a poignant moment later in the film. Frank has been home-schooling Mary and now believes it's time she transitions to public school for the socialization aspect  ""try being a kid for once"" he urges. Of course, Mary's teacher Bonnie (Jenny Slate, Obvious Child) immediately realizes Mary is special, and just like that, the wheels of the educational system are in motion to explain to Frank why they know what's best for Mary  a high-fallutin private school where she can be all she can be.There is a really nice and enjoyable story here of Uncle Frank dedicated to doing what he thinks is best for bright and charming and spirited young Mary, but it all comes crashing down when the bureaucrats, and ultimately Frank's mother (Lindsay Duncan), get involved. When the adults can't agree on the best route for Mary, a courtroom battle ensues. Ms. Duncan gets a witness scene reminiscent of Jack Nicholson in A Few Good Men, and her overall performance stands in effective stark contrast to the warm fuzzies of Mr. Evans.The supporting cast contributes nicely, though Octavia Spencer's role as kindly neighbor Roberta is more limited than it should be, and the love connection between Evans and Ms. Slate could have easily been omitted - but she is so pleasant on screen, that we don't mind at all. Glenn Plummer and John Finn are the attorneys who go to war, and Fred the one-eyed cat also gets plenty of screen time. But there is little doubt that the movie really belongs to the effervescent Miss Grace. She nails the back and forth between kid and genius, and we never doubt her sincerity.Child prodigies have been explored through other fine movies such as Little Man Tate, Searching for Bobby Fisher, and Shine, and while this one may run a bit heavier on melodrama, but it's worthy of that group. The best discussions after this movie would revolve around what's best for the child. Should she be deprived of ""higher"" education in order to live within a more ""normal"" social environment? Are any of the adults more interested in their own ego than in what's in the child's best interest? Home school vs public school vs private school is always good for some fireworks, and everyone has their own thoughts. So how do we decide who gets to decide? Does a parent get the final say on their child – even if their motivations may be in doubt? Should every kid be pushed to their academic – or artistic – or athletic – limits? The questions are many and the answers are complicated. There is a great line in the film that itself is worthy of conversation: ""You got on the bad side of a small-minded person with authority"".

Frank's plans for a normal school life for Mary are foiled when the seven-year-old's mathematical abilities come to the attention of Frank's formidable mother Evelyn (Lindsay Duncan) whose plans for her granddaughter threaten to separate Frank and Mary. Octavia Spencer plays Roberta, Frank and Mary's landlady and best friend. Jenny Slate is Mary's teacher, Bonnie, a young woman whose concern for her student develops into a connection with her uncle as well.

1230,Mustang,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3339027/,"I just saw this movie in a nearly full capacity packed 300 seat theater. Very rarely I rate 10 out of 10, but this piece of film art blew me away from beginning to end, so what more can a viewer expect out of cinema.Five teenagers grow up in a very conservative Turkish village. From early age it is expected that they will marry with a boy the elders prefer, rather than loose themselves in foolish romance. What makes the movie so appealing is the outstanding acting performances of the five teenagers and the realistic way the plot develops. Mustang at the same time offers a laugh and a tear; the viewer is offered the perspective of young ladies growing up, discovering their sexuality and being told that this is a bad thing.Of course some critics will argue that this movie might give viewers a wrong impression about Turkey. This kind of criticism would be the same as stating when a director portrays a story about any kind of bad situation in a certain country, a viewer might get a wrong impression about the country as a whole. This way not one movie should be set in any country in the world because some viewers will always generalize a specific situation.This movie is clearly set in a small rather isolated agricultural village in Turkey; it clearly isn't set in Istanbul (the more modern capital of Turkey). The director also does a very good job of not pointing the finger towards Islam (the main religion in Turkey).What is questioned in this movie is not so much about religion, it is conservatism as a concept which is questioned. A must see movie, one of the best if not the best I've seen in 2015 and the only one I saw in 2015 I rate 10/10.",Mustang

1232,Baby Driver,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3797112/,"I don't consider myself a movie expert or anything but I'd like to think I know a good movie when I see one, even if it's not exactly my cup of tea. Baby Driver was actually supposed to be. It had the potential to be a decent action movie but I was suspicious from the moment I saw it had 8.3 on here. I mean, what could have they done with this movie to deserve such a high rating? So, just in case, I lowered my expectations and, somehow, I still managed to be disappointed. Is it possible I am not seeing the originality and perfection of this movie that everyone keeps talking about?Let's go over the good parts first. The soundtrack, of course. I was very pleased with the song choices and that alone has salvaged this movie from a tempting lower rating than 6/10. Then, the action. One could argue that is seemed forced in some cases, which is true, but overall, I can appreciate the bad-ass driving scenes and the well executed violent confrontations.Now it's time for the cons. To begin with, I feel like this had the potential to be a great story and somehow it got boring before it even began. The relationship between Elgort's (Baby) and Spacey's (Doc) characters could have given some wind to the wings of this movie. Baby's past could have done the same. I swear, there are so many things which could have been used to make some sense out of the story and out of the characters, but they just didn't elaborate on anything well enough to interest the viewers. It's like they wanted this movie to be so many different things that they ended up with a little bit of everything which amounted to nothing much when put together. Onto the girl. I just don't find her character believable nor do I see any relevance of having her in the movie other that to slow down the pace of it. I could go on about all the things which were ridiculous about this love story, but then again, maybe I'm just too cynical to understand it. Next stop, Spacey and Foxx. Come. On. Guys. I adore both of them and I was hoping for either of them to be the highlight of this movie. They were not. It felt like Specey couldn't be bothered to deliver a good performance. I was half expecting him to keyser soze his way out of it and turn the whole thing around and there was even a perfect moment to do so. And then nothing. Foxx didn't do a bad job but this character of his was already used in Horrible bosses so I can't give him much credit for it.The list really could go on for much longer. I don't expect movies like this to have relatable characters nor a reality based storyline, but I do expect a level of consistency, which is something this movie is lacking big time. I enjoy when a movie has more than one thing to offer but this whole ""love story from a musical on one side and a serious, violent heist on the other"", is just not working in a way I find interesting.",Baby Driver
1233,Only the Brave,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3836247/,"Personally I found nothing wrong with this movie which is something I rarely say when I go to the theaters now days. The cast was great and really got you interested in the characters. It stayed mostly true to the actual story of these brave men whilst throwing in a little bit more drama and action to ""Hollywood"" it. The ending will have you shedding a tear even though we all knew what happens going into it. Was well worth the money spent and deserves a higher rating than critics have given it.",N/A
1234,Bridge of Spies,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3390693/,"I am a Cold War child, born in a country which did have common borders with a Warsaw Pact member but was never a target of thermonuclear destruction. I was still at primary school when I came across a couple of serialized excerpts from Powers' memoir. He really caught my imagination. I saw ""The Spy Who Came in from the Cold"" and ""Across the Bridge"" (with Rod Steiger), films in which the bridge is both the passage and the frontier, a no-man's land in which destinies can be decided in a split second of hesitation or bad luck.Bridge of Spies was a great disappointment. Cars and costumes were fine but the spirit and the people of the era was absent. I don't understand why, when I think of ""Munich"" or ""Schindler's List"", when there are so many novels to consult for the atmosphere and so many memoirs to consult for the facts. Why was Powers pictured with such unkind shallowness? Why were CIA men and DDR functionaries such caricatures? No matter how great Mark Rylance was, where was the motivation and the ideology of the Soviet spy? Where were the political leaders of the two superpowers? How did the little lawyer from the Bronx become such a cool operative behind the lines, from one day to the other, without experiencing any fear or trepidation?There is nothing wrong with high morals or nostalgia in cinema but when a film tries to portray an episode from a complex political and ideological conflict serving only these ingredients, then I can only be disappointed at the waste of means and opportunities. Pity.",Bridge of Spies
1235,Incredibles 2,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4424344/,"It's just full of propaganda, I enjoyed it overall but almost every 10 minutes there was something new trying to brainwash me which I appreciated very little.The ambassador or whatever it was is a woman, that's fine. They added what seems to be some sexually ambiguous folk in there as well, which is also fine. They said Elastigirl is a better superhero than Mr. Incredible, they showed how great of a mother and super hero she is. Then they showed how crap Mr. Incredible is at looking after the house and everything in life to be honest, a complete disaster in fact.At the start they had to make sure Violets boyfriend tells us how he likes powerful women 'cause he's so secure in his masculinity or whatever. Two siblings run a major company, the brains behind the operation of couse, a woman. The parents of the two siblings died, yes, you've got the hang of it now, because the father was an idiot and didn't listen to his wife. The super intelligent villain, is that same woman. These are just some of the things I remember, but one of the scenes that really bothered me was a really short clip of a TV ad where a guy was baking a cake or something and the narrator said ""so simple even HE can do it"", imagine this scene but with a woman trying to fix a computer and the narrator saying it's so simple even SHE can do it, many people would be very upset.I thought the first movie was pretty equal, each member of the family was equally valuable, they all realised they needed each other. While the super intelligent superhero might have been a guy, the super intelligent superhero suit designer Edna is a woman. It all seemed pretty well balanced. I'm just shocked the judge at the end wasn't a black woman as well to be honest.I'm all up for having women with the more significant roles in a movie but this is just an overload to the point where it's blatantly obvious they're trying to brainwash us through a screen, which reminds me a lot of the villain of the movie, peculiar... The message I took away from this is that we're best off just getting rid of men because women are perfect. I guess that's what equality means now a days.",Incredibles 2

But i HIGHLY recommend you Don't waste your time and money on this movie. If you really want to see it that bad..wait for the DVD...trust me it isn't worth it. At one point in the movie even The Rock says please stop singing. Two good things i can say. The short story before the movie started was outstanding. Its called Inner Workings.

However, I was very pleasantly surprised by the film, and my kids loved it.Let me start by saying that the original music for the film was outstanding. When watching Disney, you expect it to be good, but the soundtrack is amazing. The animation in the film was also what you'd expect from Disney...superb.Now as far as the plot goes. You have a heroine, and what I feel is the first real heroine in all of the animated films that I've watched. Most films make a forced effort to show girls that they can also excel and be whoever they choose. Moana takes a girl, who's also a princess by the way but an ordinary one, and allows her to truly explore, achieve, and save the world not through magic, extraordinary power or luck, but through hard work and perseverance. She is real. Maui is also the perfect comic relief and the Rock does an excellent job in this roll.My kids want to watch it again and so do I.",Moana
1238,Creed,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3376293/,"This HAS to be the year of nostalgia with the Original Star Wars trilogy remake, the Return to Jurassic Park Reboot and the memory of 1960's Bond in Spectre. But, the one I never asked for, nor anyone really needed, was to see Rocky XXXVIII.Butsince so many people kept asking my opinion on it and how many rave reviews I've heard that might equate Oscar buzz, I decided to check it out. I am sorry I did.Not that the movie's ineptly made, it's just an incredible retread of countless boxing movies before it. Hell, it even played homage to all the previous Rocky training montages before itand repeatedly. Over and over. Half way through I was ready to give up with the extreme number of clichés and unoriginal ideas/paths, but figured the second half HAS to be better since so many people loved it so much.Nope. The second half was just as dull and the same old story. In fact, once the climax hit – the obligatory finale in any of these boxing movies – I had completely tuned out. Not only did I know how it would pan out, I didn't care one bit.This movie had one singular fresh idea (son of former boxing champ in the Rocky series, Apollo Creed, is introduced) but every single other minute was unoriginal and predictable from six scenes leading up. It was so by the numbers, it's a wonder anyone even cared to even mention the movie to me. I wish someone would tell me how this movie is so great and stands out from every other boxing film. Okay, the lead, Michael B. Jordan was decent, but he was just playing his role in this ""should've been made-for-Lifetime-TV movie."" Sylvester Stallone has reinvented himself many, many years ago, as an aging action star, and now he's completely beyond that. It's getting old and perhaps it's time, SlyI guess if you're heavily into boxing, boxing movies AND just want to see the exact same movie you've seen countless times before, you might like it. Otherwise, it's an extreme waste of more than two hours.",N/A
1239,Leviathan,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3172132/,"""All power comes from God. As long as it suits Him, fear not.""After receiving an Oscar nomination for best foreign film, I finally decided to watch this 140 minute long movie. I was hopeful I was finally going to see Russians not having to play villains, but to my surprise this film attacks its own society and the corruption behind its government and official church. It takes a while to get into but after the slow opening twenty minutes the plot began to hook me and the next two hours flew by as the plot got better and better. Despite being a film that brilliantly attacks the corruption of its own government and society, it does so in a universal way so we can all relate to these issues. Loosely based on the biblical story of Job, we follow the main character go through one injustice after another. Director Andrey Zvyagintsev brilliantly captures the humanity of this working class family who are forced out of their own property by the corrupt local Mayor. It is the universal tale of an everyday man struggling against the injustices of an oppressive system (The Clash's ""I Fought the Law"" song came to mind several times while watching this film). We get glimpses of hope when a friend of the family comes to their defense and tries to confront the big man by uncovering some dirt from his past, but some interesting twists take place and the family dynamics are shaken. The final fifteen minutes of this film were brilliant and I am glad Zvyaginstsev didn't sell out for an easy or feel good ending. The cinematography is also gorgeous thanks to the beautiful location. The film takes place in a small coastal town near the Barents Sea and we get several amazing shots of the waves crashing into the rocks. The beautiful landscape is a huge contrast with the darkness of the corrupt characters. Leviathan is a brilliant film that works as a social satire. Leviathan is a monstrous sea creature mentioned in the Bible, and it is the perfect title for a film that focuses on a small man facing monstrous obstacles. I was surprised that I ended up enjoying this film as much as I did. I still have a lot of catching up with my foreign films, but so far this is my favorite and my frontrunner for the Oscars. The performances in this film were also great. Aleksey Serebryakov plays the lead character and he captures the essence and humanity of the hard working class. He has built his own home were he lives with his wife and child working as a mechanic. His wife works at a fish factory. He is desperate and angry for the injustice he is suffering knowing that he is about to lose his home and property. His good friend who is now a lawyer in Moscow has come to his rescue. He is also brilliantly played by Vladimir Vdovichenkov. He is the voice of reason in the film and is always trying to calm down Nikolay who has a strong temper. The corrupt lawyer is played by Roman Madyanov. He makes it easy for the audience to hate him because he represents all the injustice and corruption that we face. Nikolay's wife is played by the beautiful Elena Lyadova and she does a great job of portraying this fragile character. However my favorite supporting performance came from Anna Ukolova who plays a friend of the family and also works with Nikolay's wife. She always has some sarcastic comment about men or officials and she delivers most of the laughs in the movie. Her character helped lighten up the mood at times. The other thing that lightens the mood is the constant drinking in the movie (warning: you might get drunk just by watching them jug down those Vodka bottles). The harsh conditions that these people face force them to find refuge in their alcohol in order to suppress their pain (something many people can relate to as well). What really stands out in this film is that instead of portraying some of the key scenes Zvyaginstev decides to omit them and we are only exposed to the results and its consequences.",Leviathan

Hell, even a small time investor would have sunk the 40k into paying off the back taxes so long as you tripled his return (which could have been done in less than 3 months considering that the movie states that they're making 50k a month off of the oil) In the end, the plot of this film is just a very cheap excuse to promote very real and very serious issues that many people are facing in this country.

1243,Philomena,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2867729/,"As several critics have observed, this wonderful film, just shown at TIFF, is destined to become this year's King's Speech (which began its Oscar run in Toronto too, though Philomena has already picked up accolades in Venice). Both British films have strongly emotional undercurrents leavened by wry humour, feature outstanding performances from the leads and are based on true stories.Judi Dench, as the Irish woman whose out-of-wedlock son is taken from her by Catholic nuns and sold to a rich American couple in the 1950's, has never been better. She imbues the role with a mix of wisdom (after all, as she reminds us repeatedly, she was nurse for 30 years) and naiveté that would seem to be impossible were it not so deftly handled. While the cynical atheist portrayed by Steve Coogan rarely misses an opportunity to poke fun at her, more often than not she enjoys the last laugh.Despite the consummate acting, and Frears' slick directing, the greatest treat of the film is Steve Coogan's screenplay. Given its subject matter, the story could easily have veered into melodrama, but just when it is on the verge of doing so Coogan pulls us back from the edge. Thankfully, Coogan himself is there to convey precisely the proper blend of sarcasm and compassion.",Philomena

Steve Coogan and Judy Dench, especially Judy got it just right from the very start. They were smart, witty, serious and most of all, Judy was 'Irish' They really got the spirit of an Irish mom, that cocktail of guilt, generosity, inferiority and a heart to care for the entire world spot on.

1246,Dawn of the Planet of the Apes,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3057980/,"What on EARTH are the people who have raved about this film watching? Anything other than a co-ordinated, presumably paid, campaign of solicited positive reviews seems improbable to me.I was really looking forward to seeing this film. I loved the opening movie of this new take on the franchise for it's original and thoughtful way of kick-starting an updated 21st century imagining for the birth of sentient apes. I read Pierre Boulle's ""Monkey Planet"" in the 70's, and loved the original series of movies (even the naffer, later ones after ""escape""). This may be largely influenced by my youthful age at the time and general love of science fiction.I have no problem with the willing suspension of disbelief or escapism. A film doesn't have to make perfect sense in ""the real world"" for me to appreciate it. What i do have a huge problem with, however, is the lazy and cavalier way this movie utterly cuts loose from the premise so carefully set up in ""Rise"", and which i was intrigued to see explored further in this plot less, pointless travesty.There is so much wrong with this movie that i am simply unable to catalogue it, however, here are a few pointers.......1) it is set just 10 years after ""rise"". Yet, in this time, the West Coast of America has in the main turned into jungle. Old petrol stations are shown looking as overgrown and integrated into the greenery as various Inca ruins look today, surrounded by mature trees that tower above them.2) There is a massive population of smart apes who can use sign language, and some talking apes living in the jungle. Far more than the indigenous population of the west coast could ever explain (though only (count 'em) one Orangutang, called Maurice, in the film's only nice touch - a nod to Maurice Evans who played Dr Zaius in the original). He, at least, can also write, scribing ""Ape not kill ape"" etc on rocks, which the baby apes can presumably read??? Are you chuckling yet? In just ten short years since ""rise"", 100's of thousands of years of evolution have been spread liberally, though very unevenly, across this vast ape population, who presumably flew over to the states when they heard how cool the west coast was to hang out at these days. Though, even the apes who can't talk yet, sort of grab that extra bit of evolution needed to get a bit shouty when some ""dramatic"" piece of ""plot"" development spurs them individually on....Actually, i am losing the will to go on, since i would run up against the 1000 word limit long before i ran out of ire at the lazy, trite, inconsistent, banal, clichéd ""plot"" so i will limit myself to one more observation.3) once the apes grab automatic weapons, as they invariably must, they become instantly proficient in their use and have the supernatural ability to summon UNLIMITED AMMUNITION from the same mysterious realm that transported them all in, forged their tree dwellings and bypassed Darwin so succinctly. Plus, they get the ability to put tanks on autopilot.And i didn't even start on the humans tale.....what the hell was Gary Oldman thinking of, appearing in this pile of chimp manure. Or the overblown schmaltzy soundtrack, which ""helpfully' illustrates important emotional, or dramatic ""events"" in the film.Truly, this is an experience beyond parody. As Charlton Heston would undoubtedly have commented to the director and writers of this movie ""You maniacs! You blew it up! Ah, damn you! God damn you all to hell""1/10 for very fluid CGI, though in 2014 i begin to question whether this warrants any points, such is the accepted state of the art?",Dawn of the Planet of the Apes

1249,The Raid: Redemption,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2590108/,"Increasingly now, foreign filmmakers are making better Hollywood action movies than Hollywood is. In this case an English director who evidently now works in Indonesia seems to have mastered all the action story tenets despite this being only his 3rd feature film. Even more, the number of layers to this story parallels the number of floors in the apartment building that is at the centre of this film. All I could think of is how Hollywood will eventually commandeer this film and make a lifeless by-the-numbers knock-off that will only stain the original. And of course, the budget of the original is about the same as a Hollywood B-list movie actor's salary.This film is a disciple of the Asian extreme action genre, with over-the-top karate and acrobatics mixed with guns and violence. Betrayal isn't just a plot twist in these films, it's the first act. At least 5 or 6 betrayals are expected in these type of films where thieves betray other thieves, cops betray other cops, and honest guys get betrayed by best friends. What makes this film a standout is the unflinching action and well choreographed fight sequences by leads Yayan Ruhian and Iko Uwais. Early Jackie Chan movies got this kind of notice overseas because of their energy and gifted action instincts. Here, Gareth Evans is a one man powerhouse writer, director, and editor, masterminding this intricate chess match of good guys trapped on the sixth floor, with angry thugs coming up from the fifth floor and determined killers descending from the seventh floor. You feel our heroes feel trapped and vulnerable. Evans finds sources of tension from many places. The apartment building has tenants with unknown loyalties. The man heading the raid has unknown motives. Each character is well established with a minimum amount of screen time, keeping the action going.I was urged by a movie reviewer to see this film, describing it as one of the best action movies ever made. And you have to agree, this film, after providing a few minutes of backstory, takes off straight into the police raid of the apartment building filled with bad guys and a gang lord. Cinematography takes lessons from ""Saving Private Ryan"", using hand-held documentary style footage during firefights, and blasting the soundtrack with dozens of loud guns firing at once. The pulsing synthesiser score also hits with the punchy music stabs that propel the momentum as the police troops make their way up to the big bad guy on the top floor.Action sequences are creative and provide new angles and fight tactics that keep the hand-to-hand combat kinetic. Fans of the Bourne movies are encouraged to seek this out. (Not a coincidence that a Bourne Legacy trailer played before this showing). Many human moments also ground this film. An innocent man caught in the crossfire, gets asked to risk his life. A police squad leader who gets frustrated when the man conducting the raid puts his troops at risk. A child hired as lookout for the gang lord must die in order to prevent him from sounding the alarm.There is an intensity to this film that resembles scenes from ""Black Hawk Down"", with very intelligent setups for conflict, and innovative approaches to getting from point A to point B. This fresh drive, propelled by good guy Iko Uwais makes this 1 hour 40 minute film zip along with no time out to catch your breath. The fact this film is subtitled will prevent it from being a widespread hit, although it will no doubt have a long life on DVD. Instead, I expect director Gareth Evans to be directing movies with 150 times the budget of this small gem within a very short time.",The Raid: Redemption
1250,The Raid: Redemption,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2586247/,"I decided to wait a full day before writing a critical review on this movie to let my emotions die down - In conclusion i have nothing but praise for this movie. If your goal is to walk into this movie and be psychologically challenged or expect great dialogue you will be disappointed. There are some movies that you need to walk into and know little of what will unfold to get the full cinematic experience. I always check the ratings of movies on IMDb before considering watching them and after reading some of the other user reviews on 'high octane' intensity and non stop fight scenes i in the least expected some good action in this movie. Even with that though i thought an entire movie could not be based on fighting scenes and score above an 8 on IMDb (boy was i wrong).This movie is earning glowing reviews because of the action sequences filmed in the movie that place you in a cinematic experience where you actually feel like you are watching real men fight for their lives. It's nothing poetic with backflips and flexible positions but simply man vs man often equipping anything in the room to disarm/disable and kill their opponent. It places you in the hot seat viewing the closest things to actual killings - Now this isn't to say the movie slows down on blood spurts or zooms in when someone is getting their throat sliced - it simply shows it how it is, it's fast, real and intense.In some of the other reviews you hear fans praising the knife fighting scenes. This movie was incredible with it's knife fights and how effective and swift they are in close quarters. The finish was always swiftly at the throat but that wasn't before 2 to 3 lightning touches to the chest/quads or arms to disable an opponent or render them shocked in pain.Heres the bottom line: This movie was made on the smallest budget i've ever seen for any movie to hit international screens. The director and all actors are no names that you have never heard however i guarantee that you will never watch another action film again because the raid is groundbreaking in it's reality/intensity and quality of choreography.Every movie that scores high ratings appeals to a certain group of audiences. This is a very specific movie but is well deserving of the praise it is receiving from our users at IMDb. It is my hope to see more of this action from the director and actors cause i honestly don't think i can ever watch a fighting movie again. MUST WATCH 10/10 Excellent.",The Raid

When Mike and Brian arrest a gangster and find a great load of drugs and people involved in human-trafficking, they are sentenced to death by the Cartel and hunted down by a Mexican gang. What will happen to them?""End of Watch"" is an excellent film, showing the story of two charismatic police officers patrolling the streets of South Central Los Angeles in their daily work and personal lives, since they are best friends. Despite the great storyline, the execution uses the annoying ""found footage"" cheap style, maybe with the intention of giving the idea of documentary using an awful camera work.

1252,The Secret World of Arrietty,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2477429/,"This weekend, I got to see two animated movies with my kids. Rio and Arrietty. Even though Rio is the noisy one, their heart was with Arrietty, this beautiful witty character, on the verge of adulthood.The developing relationship with Sho, how improbable it may be, is portrayed beautifully in all its complexity.I don't understand people who say Ghibli movies have a problem with pace. I agree the pace is different. These Japanese guys take the time to tell a story, respect for that.The attention to detail is stunning, as always. It's so vivid and colorful... Nobody comes close to Ghibli. Especially the animals are amazing, carefully avoiding the ""cuteness""... My favorite scene is when Arrietty is climbing the roof. This is so painstakingly perfect animated... Craftsmanship becomes art...The end is both sad and hope-giving, but hey so is life... bittersweet.Don't believe the critics, go see this one if you get the chance. You won't be disappointed. It's a shame this movie doesn't get the attention it deserves outside of Japan.",Arrietty
1253,The Secret World of Arrietty,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2280885/,"Now, unless you live in Japan and actually made it to one of the opening showings, I'm probably the only person reading this who has watched Arrittey so far. As such, I'm going to try my best to review the movie without giving any real spoilers away. And the first thing I have to say is, I thought Arrietty the Borrower was a wonderful movie. The entire film had this amazing feeling of being both unique from other Ghibli movies while still maintaining the parts that make almost all of the Studio's films so great. On the one hand, it had the huge imagination and fully realized and fantastically detailed world of a Miyazaki movie. On the other hand, it had a unique feeling of bittersweet melancholy and wonderful character interactions somehow unlike most of the films that have come before it. While Miyazaki's screen writing clearly had some great effects on the movie, I could really feel the new directorial style of Yonebashi shining through. And it was so hard to believe this was his first film; I often feel like I should give Miyazaki Goro some slack for Earthsea because it was his first movie, but Arrietty just seemed so well thought-out and put together comparatively. This really makes me beyond excited to see what Yonebashi does in the future. There are many aspects of the film that deserve mention for how damn well-done they were; the beautiful animation, the strong voice-work, the great characters, the fantastic music. What is easily one of the standout points of the movie was how incredibly immersive the tiny world of the Borrowers was. Every part of their home, located beneath a pile of unused bricks stored under the human house, is made of small everyday items we hardly think about forgot junk that the Borrowers used so well as tools, furniture, decoration, everything. The sheer size of everything in comparison to them is striking, creating a strange world of adventure and dangers that are really just the most common, ignored of things to us humans. Perhaps my favorite scene is one where, very mild spoilers here, Arrietty's father takes her borrowing for the first time. They walk nimbly across nails sticking out from the foundations of the building, use construction staples as ladders, bouldering over the (to them) boulder sized junk lost between the walls of the house. Far bellow a few mice, the size of lions, scurry in the gloom, their eyes burning red. When Arrietty and her father final exit from between the walls into the darkened kitchen at night, the sheer enormity of the room, the intense sound of the looming and massive refrigerator, the sheer walls that compromise the sides of cabinets, they all take the breath out of both Arrietty and the viewer. That entire scene, where they use ingeniously use tiny household items to scale the counters to raid for sugar cubes a third their size, is simply amazing to watch. So many magical scenes like this made up the entire movie, but that was perhaps the best of them all. The characters are for the most part wonderful as well, though in some ways more subdued than Miyazaki tends to make his own. Arrietty is another in the long line of string Ghibli heroines, but like all of them manages somehow to be unique and wonderful all by herself. She's a young girl who's confident, kind, and capable, but is still unsure of herself at time. Sho, the young human she meets and the other main character, is a very strong character as well, his weak body and strong spirit in conflict, with a air or both peace and melancholy about him (like much of the movie, really). Another one of my favorites was Arrietty's father, who was both strong and quite, but in his own gruff way very kind and a great father. The rest of the cast is very good, though not quite as memorable.As for the music for by Cécile Corbel, I'll admit that at first I was a little skeptical, but in the end the music fit the movie incredibly well and became another fantastic Ghibli soundtrack (which says something when you're included in the ranks among Hisaishi Joe). I love Celtic music myself, but those without that bias (the other 10 people I went with) all thought the music was one of the high points in a movie with a lot of really good points to discuss. This really was an amazing first outing for Yonebashi as a director, and really one hell of a movie. My only complaints are that perhaps at times it seemed to slow down during the second half, but in the end it turned out so well I can hardly fault it for that. The movie had a sort of bittersweet feel that I really can't think of another Ghibli movie to compare to. Sad, joyous, and beautiful, Arrietty the Borrower is the newest Ghibli classic.",Arrietty the Borrower

Not one dry eye in the place, it had a great tempo and didn't drag on or have any lulls in the story. We were both very pleased and are still engaging in conversations about the movie. It's my opinion to highly recommend to everyone go out and watch a great movie and a heartfelt movie that redefines love in this time and age we live in.

1256,True Grit,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2366790/,"Owning the original, and having looked forward to seeing the new version, I find myself wondering why the Coens rewrote the script to have LaBoeuf live, instead of following the original script and letting him die of the blow to the head administered by Chaney, after guiding his horse to pull Cogburn and Mattie from the snake pit. His death makes the outcome of the journey more bleak - the attempt to bring Chaney to justice costs yet another life - and makes Cogburn's rescue of Mattie especially urgent. It gave extra texture to what had seemed like amusing superficiality in Glenn Campbell's original performance. I wondered whether star-status made the Coens, or their money-men, think ""we can't kill Damon off - his public wouldn't accept it."" Result: LaBoeuf's presence becomes mere comic relief, and this version of the film is weakened.I wish Tommy Lee Jones had been given the part rather than Jeff Bridges. Anyone who's seen Lonesome Dove or In the Valley of Elah (or No Country for Old Men) knows that Jones would have made a brilliant Cogburn, free of the Dude-ish baggage which burdens Bridges. And I wish also that the Coens had used that boarding-house scene from the original in which Mattie, after all her pugnacious bravery, at the livery stable and with Cogburn, cradles her dead father's pocket watch and weeps, becoming a little girl again. Kim Darby made that moment real, and it lent extra power to her resolve when Cogburn and LaBoeuf tried later to ditch her. The Coens let Hailee Steinfeld look sad, but mere sadness isn't enough, and the opportunity was lost. Much to appreciate and think about in the look of this version, but some sense of the opportunities missed.",True Grit
1257,True Grit,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2354206/,"The Coen brothers are known for being one of the best filmmakers of our time. They both compliment each other perfectly. When I heard they were remaking the 1969, John Wayne classic True Grit, I was extremely excited and had incredibly high expectations of the film. Being a major fan of Western movies, I was really interested how it would turn out. I wanted the movie to be more faithful to it's original source material, Charles Portis novel, than the 1969 film had been. I was also hopeful that Jeff Bridges would fill the huge shoes of the classic, legendary John Wayne. I was hoping that they would blend the humor of the original 1969 film with some of the suspense or thrills from earlier Coen brothers films like No Country For Old Men or Fargo. But not become way too violent that it causes to stay completely unrecognizable to Charles Portis classic novel. After seeing the Coen brothers new film, I have to say. My extremely high expectations were surpassed. The movie actually surprised all the hype I had, what an incredible film. The atmosphere, clothing, and the buildings reminded me of the old classic Hollywood westerns they used to make. I had a feeling of nostalgia watching the movie through the end. I felt transported to another time period of the old western. Hailee Steinfeld was amazing in the movie, I truly believe that this is her breakout performance. Matt Damon and Josh Brolin were as usual amazing. But the true star of the film has to be Jeff Bridges, in all respects ( I don't mean to offend John Wayne or anything), I think Jeff Bridges did a better job than John Wayne in portraying Rooster Cogburn. His performance showed much more experience, strength and power, the performance was pretty much unforgettable. Jeff Bridges handily reinvents the iconic role of Rooster Cogburn in the Coen brothers' back-to-the-book-remake. I congratulate the Coen for bringing back the western genre, that Hollywood has ignored so much the last decade or so. I can't stress enough how much I recommend this movie to people.",True Grit
1258,In a Better World,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2345247/,"Saw this in Toronto and it remained with me for days afterward. Shattering filmmaking! The size and elegance of a Hollywood big budget, with the honesty and challenge of an indy. The performances, especially those of the two boys, are riveting, but I was also impressed with the deep focus photography, the haunting score. Went to see this because I had so enjoyed After the Wedding - but feel this is even better. Only the ending conflict resolution is, perhaps, a little too easy-- but not unearned. And oh boy, was I grateful for it. I want to see this with my son, because I want him to experience the moral and emotional snake pit Bier and her screenwriter toss us into: every guy --no matter what age-- will get it, and none of us will like it very much. To me, Bier speaks about what it SHOULD mean to be a man. Is vengeance built into our genes? I hope not.

1261,50/50,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2522509/,"I thought this movie was pretty good; I laughed, I (didn't cry, but thought about crying), for the most part it handled its topic realistically and maturely.BUT there were three things I didn't like in this film:1. The main character's dad having Alzheimer's. Great idea, and an opportunity for comparing and contrasting ailments, but it's totally undeveloped in the story and leads nowhere and is just distracting.2. The girlfriend. She's first handled realistically, then out of nowhere becomes a huge jerk. It's okay that she's a jerk, and it's okay that she doesn't want to go to treatments with the main character: she's only human. But then she goes from a round to flat character and the butt of jokes. She wasn't given any room to develop: she became something to move the plot along, and nothing more.3. The ending. No, I'm not going to complain there's a happy ending: I'm very glad there's a happy ending, that's fine. But tagging on a ""love story"" makes the whole cancer seem like a quest-narrative, a journey that our hero must triumph over to reach his one-true-love. In essence, it's equating cancer as a ""character building"" experience, and the hero has won his prize in a girl.That's a little simplifying. I've never had cancer but people in my family have and some have died and from what I can see cancer sucks. It ruins your life and everybody around you, it's slow, it's painful, it's a horrible way to die. It's not something you laugh off. It changes you. It's not something you go through and then at the end you wipe your brow and say ""Whew! Glad that's over!"" You worry it will come back. You've been through this painful experience that wasn't caused by anything you did, that you didn't ask for. It just happened to you, and it changes you.I'm not saying I'm not glad the main character is happy and alive at the end, I'm just saying it's a little Hollywood magic that he ends up with his shrink (the only person that truly understands him?) after going through this traumatic event. It equates being in a relationship as the prize won for ""winning"" the game of cancer. There's no winners of cancer, only survivors. Validating cancer as an enriching experience and manufacturing a reward for winning it is what makes this otherwise vibrant movie both stale and oddly preachy.",N/A
1262,Kick-Ass,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2234768/,"I thought the idea of Kick Ass - everyday teens transforming themselves into superheroes to fight crime – looked like great fun. The ads looked promising too. As for the film itself, it was not lacking in skill, humour or inspiration, and it had some great performances to showcase.However, the violence here (""casual slaughter"" is a better term for it) was repugnant in its aim to excite and delight, and more than a little disturbing to watch as the audience hoots along with each 'kill'. Movies can be a great communal experience, but I can't recall a cinema experience where I have felt so depressingly cut off from my fellow human beings (a generous use of the term).I suppose we are supposed to applaud the audaciousness and black comedy of a preteen girl slicing off bad men's legs and shooting them through the head, but to me it reeked of filmmakers desperately trying to find new and novel ways to hype audiences up. Of course, they framed the carnage unconvincingly around a 'perhaps the heroes are as sociopathic as the villains' theme, lest anyone dare question their motives. (Reminds me of Terminator 2's banal anti-violence message.) Oh yes, those baddies were bad, but, for instance, I wondered how families affected by suicide might have felt as audiences cheered on Hit Girl as she forces a bad guy to shoot himself through the head. Oh, but I'm missing the point, I guess The sad thing is that Kick Ass could have achieved its thematic aims without the graphic carnage. However, I doubt this approach would not have brought director Matthew Vaughan and writer Jane Goldman quite the level of attention they would appear to crave.It's well time that Oliver Stone made Natural Born Killers 2 in order to provide another perceptive and unflattering mirror to an increasingly apathetic and sensation-focused society.P.S. some hopeful newssome Australian film critics/commentators such as David Stratton, Tom Ryan and Richard Wilkins have publicly denounced the violence in the film.

Yes, there's some teen comedic elements to this movie, but the movie flowed perfectly. Great Soundtrack, great fight scenes, acting was good, story was great and original. With a current IMDb rating of 8.3 as I write this, look's like I'm not alone on how I rated this movie. Show stealer was definitely Hit Girl. I foresee her having a huge career. Possibly the next Natalie Portman. Reminded me of Natalie's role in Leon. Which leads me to my next point. Unless you're into comic books, video games, in your teens/20's/30's and don't have a young kid, you might be taken aback that a little 11 year old girl is killing people and using bad words. For those that gave this a bad review because of that, do some research on a movie before you go see something that you think you won't like. I hate musicals and I'm not going to pay 10 bucks to see High School Musical and then come in here and complain that there was too much singing and dancing.

1264,Celda 211,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2232351/,"I believe there is a prison sub-genre of movies. This is the best I have seen in this sub-genre and is very close to the French ""Un Prophete"".The action starts immediately and the characters are build through out the movie. There are a few flashbacks, just to cool off the action momentarily. Luis Tosar as the leading prisoner is just amazing, his voice is so unique. This thriller is so intense, but without a sea of blood or extremely violent scenes, just amazing dialogs, acting and especially plot. The prisoners are not presented as bodybuilders full of tattoos, but exactly as they are in real life.Everything is happening so fast, just as needed to trap your eyes and mind, like only a handful Hollywood films. Only few scenes out of the jail, just to add to the intrigue and last a couple of minutes each.Finally I want to write about unpredictability, which is my first concern when I watch modern cinema: no actions or dialogs can be predicted, so different with the typical Hollywood scheme. Carlos Bardem pretends that he is an inmate; one can say that he will be discovered at the very end; but even so, this happens so suddenly and at a moment that it doesn't make any difference.10 out of 10 and highly recommended.",N/A

It is deeply unsettling, profound, and beautifully executed.I have to admit that my expectations were lowered by Antonio Banderas' involvement and the plot (allegedly) involving a surgeon trying to do something or other. It sounded like a tame, modern, artsy reinvention of ""Eyes Without A Face."" I suppose that film is a part of its heritage, but The Skin I Live In is much more engaging and unsettling.I'm not going to take the time to organize my thoughts into a proper five-paragraph format.

Have you got some?"". On countless occasions we see the students' mindsets change through tiresome interactions with their parents. The story becomes more and more preposterous as it wears on with a group of kids becoming fascists after a few days of wearing the same shirt in class.On the plus side I would say the lead character is quite effective in the role when not let down by the script and the direction and editing are at times fairly impressive.Overall, I'd say watch this if predictable, right-on German films are your thing, but for me it was an ordeal, with the message of the movie revealing the blindingly obvious i.e. that fascism can spread under certain circumstances, but the idea that these teenagers would become Nazis in a week is frankly ridiculous.",The Wave

The drama unfolds relatively slowly at first, but with gathering momentum and consequences. There is also a very moving portrayal of some of the tensions produced within some of the romantic pairings as well as the extreme anguish caused in one student by his heightened susceptibility. I think the depth to which personal relationships and social groupings are explored make this into much more of a fascinating drama than an exercise in the condemning of fascism.

1269,Sherlock Holmes,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2189696/,"I am so very tired of people reviewing movies, which are subjective by nature, as blanketly ""best ever"" this and ""best ever"" that. That's simply a case of small minds and big egos at work. There are so many great Holmes films and portrayals out there, that it's asinine to declare any one film or one actor as ""the best"". Most reviewers who rave about this film claim how it finally got ""it"" right. Got what right? Your personal interpretation of Sherlock Holmes in your mind? What about Jack's mind? What about Sally's? Some go so far as to claim this film merits something extra because it debunks the very debatable myth that Holmes never wore the famous deerstalker cap. For the record, Holmes was described as wearing a hat made of ""cloth"" that was an ""ear-flapped traveling cap"" in the story Silver Blaze. Original illustrator Sidney Paget saw that as meaning a deerstalker in his mind and an image even more famous than the writing on the page was born. Sounds like Paget made a pretty sound deduction too if you ask me. Regardless, if you personally don't think Holmes ever wore a deerstalker in the stories would facts like that alone or in combo boost a film so much as to make its interpretation ""the best"". Equally valid claims can be made that Basil Rathbone, Jeremy Brett, Arthur Wontner, Douglas Wilmer, Peter Cushing, Clive Merrison, and others depending on your taste are the best. The question is, was the movie any good on its own and were the performances fun. I don't give a hoot if it was exactly how you pictured Holmes in your mind or if you thought it was better/worse than other Holmes' films or that it somehow isn't as authentic because it wasn't a verbatim dramatization of a Conan Doyle tale, etc (Jeremy Brett fans, you know what I'm talking about). If you liked the movie, great. If you like other Holmes' a lot better, more power to you. I personally think the new Sherlock Holmes film took a lot of hinted at bits of Holmes' personality and skills from the canon and gave those characteristics the spotlight. That's fine. Those aren't the qualities that took reign when I read the stories, but who cares? Why would I want to see the exact same thing I saw when I read the books? That would make for a monotonous world. Hurray for everybody's various interpretations and subjective and wonderfully different tastes! There are no gospel truths about movies or books or art, so please just say you ""liked it a lot"" instead of it was ""the best"". That's so unhelpful. Just tell me what you liked about it as a film on its own without comparing it to any books, or other versions/interpretations. That's like saying one food item is ""the best"". It's ridiculous. On a final note, this new interpretation is a welcome addition to the world of Sherlock Holmes. It doesn't diminish any of the older films or television series. It stands on its own as another fun ride for fans of mystery, action, and those who love many things Sherlock.",N/A
1270,The Blind Side,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2210425/,"I endured this movie wondering How on earth the scriptwriters were able to come up with such fakery! The fact the Sandra Bullock has been lauded for her role in the movie is no surprise given that she is basically the only character with more that a few lines in the movie, she does do a good job, but it wasn't 'outstanding'. Another reason to question the script is the lack of dialogue of the main protagonist - Michael. He is written into the movie as a chap with low IQ and almost mute - now, given that the actual young man is intelligent and a fantastic sportsman, I don't understand why he is portrayed in such a dim light - it actually comes across as racially condescending. On this note, we almost turned the movie off due to it's many cringeworthy moments such as the portrayal of racial differences (the 'oh-my god it's s bunch of black guys smoking pot' scene, stepford wives lunches- so perfectly perfect it is hideous-they even bicker perfectly, the fact that the house is portrayed as being HUGE but they only had room enough for Michael to sleep on the $10,000 sofa, (I could go on...) Though is was so cringy - it bought us much mirth after the movie in acting-out these ridiculous scenes again. Watch the movie if you like to be taken to lala land and enjoy life as fakery.

I've always thought Sandra Bulluck has been over-rated, but she nails this role & deserves some recognition down the road. The movie is so fantastic that anyone and everyone can relate and feel connected to the characters. The ideal target audience for this movie is children and adults alike. This movie should be an Oscar contender but I know these types of movies rarely ever win. Definitely deserves my vote!",N/A
1272,The Visitor,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1873902/,"Thomas McCarthy's two films, The Station Agent and The Visitor, are both concerned with a person not in his element of social space, of being disconnected from other people and not really based on him wanting it on himself, but somehow finds people to connect with without any force and gets wrapped up in their lives because he is, basically, a good person. Peter Dinklage played the former title character, and now we have Richard Jenkins (a veteran character we all know and admire but never really peg who he is most of the time he shows up) as a middle aged college professor who's wife has passed on and doesn't have any passion for teaching or writing his next book.He takes begrudgingly a task to give a speech on a paper he only co-wrote in name in New York City, and finds in his old apartment a couple (Syrian and African played by Haaz Sleiman and Danai Gurira) who have been living there for a couple of months. Somehow a bond grows between them, mostly between the two men over playing on the drum. Then something happens, tragically, which changes everything, but it's not what you might think at first.It would appear that the Visitor is a film about the underrated horror of the problems of being an illegal in America, and the processes of the government basically not giving a damn about most of the people, and most of whom haven't done a thing. While McCarthy nears the film towards preachy ground in these bits, they're few and far between. His great strength is in making value out of good people forced into circumstances that make them show how good they really are. Jenkins could just leave the guy behind in that jail, but there's something about his plight that affects him, not simply for the obvious but because of a connection on a pure level (through, most crucially, music) that goes beyond class or race or whatever.It's a very precise moral story, but it needs the performances to carry it. Luckily, McCarthy is an actor's director, and Jenkins is able to be subtle about it and able to convey frustration when required very naturally. He depicts a loneliness to the character that is cracked through his ties to these new characters, including Tarek's mother, and all of the actors around him are up to 'snuff' too (especially Haaz Sleiman as the good-natured man who got screwed over by a faulty immigration process). They help make such a small-scale story worth telling, and it's a true sleeper that demands some more attention, at some point or another, which might be on video or on the inevitable screenings on the IFC channel.",The Visitor
1273,The Visitor,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1732598/,"Thomas McCarthy's 2nd film after the wonderful ""Station Agent"" is equally good, if not better. I can't recommend Richard Jenkins' performance any higher here. He plays a widowed professor who is drifting through life rather aimlessly until he visits his New York apartment and finds there are two people squatting there. I won't give away anything else, except to say that it'll be a shame if this film flies under the radar. Jenkins is a character actor that everyone recognizes, but that few of us know. Here he occupies the first third of the film practically alone, and reminds us in moments of the Jack Nicholson character from ""About Schmidt"" with his dry humor that is on display for his crabby piano teacher.Don't you just love watching an actor up there alone who keeps you spellbound in a subtle way? That's how this movie starts, and gradually we come to meet the couple in Jenkins' apartment, and the mother of one of them. The movie flows economically and with much care, but by the end it creeps up on us and makes us feel glad along the way as well as making us pause and reflect on the state of our world.Lovely, lovely movie.",N/A
1274,Seven Pounds,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2041489/,"Seven Pounds, this was the movie where I was just convinced Will Smith is really going for the ""I'm going to make you cry"" films. One thing I can give him a ton of credit for, the man can cry. My only thing is, as moving as the story is, Will Smith has proved time and time again that he can act, so why is he taking this extremely depressing story? But nevertheless it's still a good movie. I do have to admit it made me cry, but I felt that the stand out performance was Rosario Dawson, I absolutely love this girl, ever since I saw her in 25th Hour with Ed Norton, I knew this girl was going to go far. She's beautiful, charming, funny and talented, can't wait to see how much further her career is going to go. But her and Will Smith, not so sure if they had the great chemistry that the film needed that would've made this into a great film.Two years ago Tim Thomas was in a car crash, which was caused by him using his mobile phone; seven people died: six strangers and his fiancée. A year after the crash, and having quit his job as an aeronautical engineer, Tim donates a lung lobe to his brother, Ben, an IRS employee. Six months later he donates part of his liver to a child services worker named Holly. After that he begins searching for more candidates to receive donations. He finds George, a junior hockey coach, and donates a kidney to him, and then donates bone marrow to a young boy named Nicholas. Two weeks before he dies he contacts Holly and asks if she knows anyone who deserves help. She suggests Connie Tepos, who lives with an abusive boyfriend. Tim moves out of his house and into a local motel taking with him his pet box jellyfish. One night, after being beaten, Connie contacts Tim and he gives her the keys and deed to his beach house. She takes her two children and moves in to their new home. Having stolen his brother's credentials, and making himself known by his brother's name Ben, he checks out candidates for his two final donations. The first is Ezra Turner, a blind vegetarian meat salesman who plays the piano. Tim calls Ezra Turner and harasses him at work to check if he is quick to anger. Ezra remains calm and Tim decides he is worthy. He then contacts Emily Posa, a self-employed greeting card printer who has a heart condition and a rare blood type. He spends time with her, weeding her garden and fixing her rare Heidelberg printer. He begins to fall in love with her and decides that as her condition has worsened he needs to make his donation.Seven Pounds is a good film and no doubt worth a look, I would just recommend going for the rental vs. the theater. Will Smith pulls in a good performance, but not his best, just most of the film required him crying in every scene, but the last one with him is a doozy. But I loved the ending, it was beautiful and really made you appreciate life and to not take it for granted. There is still good people in this world and Ben's character reminds you to value life and to give to those who are in desperate need. Although he went a little far, but it was still a beautiful story.7/10",Seven Pounds

Given the state that I am currently in, I have often asked myself if I am a good person. Have I done enough? Have I made enough sacrifice? What do I deserve?

1276,Eastern Promises,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1730427/,"First of all it is amazing the amount of research that went into this movie. When Mortissen's characters says that his father worked for the government, in Russian he actually says: ""Hunched his back for the uncle""! Even the poster with little and index finger straighter then the rest, it all breathers authenticity.I didn't go in expecting non-Russian actors to suddenly have no accent, but I did have hesitations about the pronunciation, that usually tends to be horrible. Not so here, despite the accent (that was slight), the intonation, the way the characters cary themselves especially Mortinssen's are very Russian. (Even his less then perfect English sounds Russia when he misses articles: ""Not good place for girl to grow up."") Overall the director shows a bit of what a real SinCity looks like. Violence is like a snap of a whip, sudden and loud. The movie is very stylish, but without trying to be so. It's just how these people like to live their lifes. A lot has been said about acting and it is true Mortinssen really delivers. All the auther actors are great too though, there is no weak link in this movie.Anyway the bottom line: The most authentic movie about Russian mobsters that the west has produced so far. Furthermore I find the only aspect in which it looses to the Godfather is scope. Although the movie is complete I can not help, but to want for more. The best film I've seen this year.",N/A

This one will be compared to ""The Princess Bride"" and although it doesn't measure up to that classic, it is extremely entertaining and well made in its own right. The story line is a bit odd and the whole wall thing is never really explained, but the execution is fine, even building up strong suspense.Charlie Cox plays Tristan, who falls for the wrong girl (Sienna Miller), and agrees to fetch her a fallen star ... who happens to be played by the stunning Claire Danes. Not much suspense on what happens with these two, but the suspenseful part comes in with the wicked witch played by Michelle Pfeiffer and the prince son of King Peter O'Toole looking to reclaim the ruby necklace our ""star"" is wearing. Lots of bad chasing the good.Along the way, an encounter with the strangest pirate you will see (including any from the Carribbean). Robert Deniro plays Captain Shakespeare - tough on the inside, and shall we say in touch with his feminine side. Another encounter involves the brilliant Ricky Gervais as a fast talking trader and that is good for a couple of laughs.Not your typical chase, coming of age, or fantasy film, but director Matthew Vaughn's (""Layer Cake"") effort deserves an audience. Sadly the poor marketing campaign will probably prevent it from making any money. My guess it will find big success on video.",Stardust

1279,The Secret of Kells,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2293512/,"There aren't too many Irish made Oscar nominated movies so I was looking forward to watching ""The Secret of Kells"" directed by Tomm Moore.The standard of animation was very high, breathtaking at times. The animators seemed to have been inspired by beauty of the Book of Kells itself as they have created some of the most colourful and vibrant images I've seen in a movie in a long time.The story is about a young boy (Brendan) living in the monastery of Kells where his uncle is the Abbot. His uncle is obsessed with building up the defences of the monastery to protect them from the marauding Vikings. Other monks are transcribing sacred manuscripts. A monk arrives from the island of Iona with an uncompleted book after Vikings have destroyed the monastery there. Brendan is talented at drawing and takes a lot of interest in the new monk and the book, much to the displeasure of his uncle. Aided by a fairy (Aisling) he meets in the forest Brendan finishes the book just before the Viking attack. Interestingly the story has elements of both Ireland's Christian and pagan heritage but the ending seems quite abrupt especially when the film is only seventy-five minutes long. Actors such as Brendan Gleeson and Mick Lally, both very familiar to Irish audiences, voice the main adult characters. Evan McGuire is excellent as Brendan.So a treat for animation fans while the story might spark curiosity in people to discover more about Irish heritage and history.",The Secret of Kells

There is incredible detail in the artwork, all of it an homage to illumination.The reviews I read said the film was a spectacle and impressive for its art and topic, but that it was dry and slow. This simply isn't true. there is a rich and innocent humour in the film, and it is an exciting story.The story itself is quite sophisticated. On the one hand, it depicts medieval Christian scholar-heroes courageously dedicated to preserving knowledge, creating books, and demonstrating reverence for words through painstaking arts, and on the other there is a magical childhood world of fairy folk and demons who are part of a hero quest that is mythical and dreamy. Both the Christian world and the pagan world are fraught with danger and violence.The imagery, themes and music of this film create a work that is sublime, Yet the warmth of the characters and the spirited adventure ensures that the audience does not feel remote from the experience. This film ranks as an instant classic and a superb achievement in the medium of animation. having now seen all the animated films nominated at the Oscars, this one should have won.See it any way you can, and don't miss a chance to see it on the big screen if the opportunity arises.",N/A
1281,Inside Man,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2136664/,"This review is full of SPOILERS and is meant for those who've seen this film. 1. Major plot flaw. The police would have identified the ""painters"" almost immediately, and this is hidden from the audience by the way in which the interrogation scenes are handled. The criminals' strategy for escape was to blend in with the other hostages and be unidentifiable. The video surveillance cameras were disabled only 2 minutes before the ""painters"" entered. By checking the videos the police would see what customers had entered the bank before then and could rule them out as ""painters."" The police could also rule-out all employees, not only because employees would be on tape, but even if not, the employees would know who of their number was in the bank at the time they were seized. This means that the ""painters"" could only be customers, and could only be among those customers who walked in during the two minutes between disabling the cameras and the entry of the ""painters."" Look at the number of customers already in the bank before the cameras went out -- a lot. Not many came in during those 2 minutes, even if some left during those 2 minutes. At most, let's say that 12 people came in during those 2 minutes, including the ""painters."" Then get physical descriptions of the ""painters'"" height, weight, sex, etc., from all the hostages. Compare those with the physical details of the 12 people. Of the 12 people, how many match each description? If one, the police have spotted a ""painter"" already. If 2 or 3 or 4, the police have a very small number of people to investigate further to expose which of that small group is a ""painter."" Moreover, every customer has to have a reason for being there: either to deal with an existing account, or open a new one. But a person opening a new account would go to an employee to start the process. So the ""painters"" each had to have already established an individual account with that bank. When did those 12 people open their accounts? The police would look at the time each of the 12 first opened an account. More recent accounts, opened at about the same date, would indicate who the ""painters"" might be. Now, why were each of the 12 at that downtown branch at that time, as opposed to a different branch or a different time? It must be, either they work nearby, or live nearby, or are running an errand where the route includes that branch. What friend or relative saw them in person before they left to go to the branch? How did they get to the branch -- walking, or subway, or taxi? How were they planning to get to their next destination? Where did they plan to go after their errand at the branch was finished? Who was expecting to see them at that place? Did anyone who was expecting to see them later that day wonder what had happened to them, or call the police to ask whether they were among the hostages? Recently opened accounts, near the date of other accounts, by people who neither live nor work near that branch, or have a plausible errand, who can't tell a plausible tale of how they got there or where they planned to go next, or who was expecting them: these are the prime suspects for ""painters."" The police very swiftly will have a very good idea who the ""painters"" are. Investigate them in detail and they are exposed; then pressure them to reveal the identities of the other criminals. This is what real police would do, but the movie, by showing the police pursuing a different, useless approach, leads the audience to think the ""painter"" masquerade would work. This movie operates on the old principle ""the criminal plot looks brilliant because the police are made to act like idiots yet look intelligent."" 2. Major moral blindness. 50 innocent citizens are terrorized, held hostage, assaulted, battered, for a day, a very significant crime, and yet at the end we are told that because nothing was stolen from the bank, the government and the police are just going to drop the whole affair. But what the criminals did to those people was a far more serious crime than any theft of bank property would have been. This movie passes-off that crime as if it were nothing, nothing at all. The terrorized hostages are pushed off the stage like so many plastic dolls who've served their role in the filmmakers' story. But those characters are human beings. The criminals, supposedly motivated by an idealistic desire to act against a Nazi profiteer, commit a horrific moral injustice on innocent people, whose rights and dignity they are blind to, in the pursuit of their own moral mission. This is a profound moral flaw in this film. The criminals are narcissists, so focused on their own desire for justice in their cause that they are blind to the injustice they inflict on others as they pursue their mission. 3. Unbelievable characters. A billionaire bank president anguished over his past exploitation of the Holocaust, but who is trying to hide his past, by hiring a real estate agent who has a side-line as a high-level ""fixer"" of rich people's problems, who is herself disgusted by his pro-Nazi past, yet takes his pay-off check anyway, and whose only attempt to ""fix"" the problem is a short and ineffective conversation with the criminal master-mind? A supposedly smart and honorable police hostage negotiator who is also the chief interrogator of the suspects, and who takes a diamond pay-off from the mastermind with a laugh, and who is completely blind to the serious crime of terrorism and hostage-taking of 50 civilians? None of these characters is believable.",N/A

1285,La Vie En Rose,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1918915/,"Sometimes, the flashback can be an effective tool. Sometimes a story is best told in pieces rather than a single, linear, contiguous whole.This movie? Goes to the other extreme. We are whipsawed back and forth all over the main character's life, increasingly as the runtime progresses -- doing little to advance our understanding or sympathy for the character. In fact, it seems specifically concocted to try and make the story more incomprehensible or simply to obscure the fact that the makers of this movie couldn't stand to try and tie together the thread of Edith Piaf's life, preferring to serve up a mishmash of melodramatically tragic vignettes.In particular, as has been mentioned, I'm not sure that revealing the death of the main character's daughter only near the end accomplishes much, or anything. It's not a ""big reveal"" or unlocks anything that we've seen all film; it seems cheap that such a particular tragedy would be deliberately hidden until near the end, and then treated as a throwaway reference. But then... characters who aren't Edith Piaf are largely treated as throwaway, popping in and out of disjointed scenes seemingly at random.There are some who might turn up their nose at linear storytelling because it is somehow too simple to lay out the line of someone's life, and forces you to make sense of the presence of others in that person's life. Using flashbacks, nonlinear disjointed scenes would require *more* skill, not less, to portray facts of the main character's personality more effectively -- a skill that is sadly, even wholly, lacking in this film.",N/A

For one thing, we're asked to suspend too much belief - with unremarkable film effects standing in for any realistic conveying of ""genuine"" magic. You'll find yourself thinking, ""oh, it's *that* sort of movie""...meaning cheesy impossible supernatural stuff -- things floating in mid air etc.. which is not clever or interesting.The Prestige is so much darker and complex. The characters have grit, passion, realism; the story and script more exciting, surprising and refined.

The Illusionist doesn't pull anything off, and lacks most qualities your keen movie appreciation is tuned for.Cinematography was fine. The acting was mostly OK if a little dry... it was the story and screenplay / dialog that was shackled - never shifting into second gear.

And nothing will ever be the same.It's difficult to describe the movie without spoilers, and I do not want to spoil a single second of what is possibly the most powerful and emotionally wrenching film I have seen for a decade and more (made all the more powerful by the haunting music). Paddy Considine (who wrote and stars in the film) is stunning as, for want of a better phrase, an avenging angel, albeit a fallen one. The menace and tension builds and builds (including perhaps the best depiction of a bad LSD trip ever set down on film - it's an extremely discomforting experience if you've ever been on the wrong end of a bad trip, believe me) until the harrowing climax. This is not a nice film. This is not a fun film. This is, however, an exceptional film, and perhaps more importantly it is an honest film, a true film if such a thing can be said of fiction.If you want smiles, or empty action, or to put your brain on hold, this is not the film for you.If, however, you want a film with genuine emotional depth, that makes you think and resonates far after the end credits have finished, then this may be what you're looking for.Just don't expect an easy ride.An overused word, but the closest I've seen to a masterpiece for many a long year.",N/A
1293,Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2096246/,"This segment of HP will disappoint all who read the novel. The Burrow burns down during x-mas break due to Bellatrix and Fenrir (who is never described as a werewolf) perhaps for the lack of action at the end of the movie...the Dursleys are completely cut from the movie, meaning when Dumbledore picks Harry up for the summer it's at the train station for some apparent reason...The Ginny/Dean/Harry dichotomy is skewed, there was no break up between Ginny and Dean and Harry is clearly in love with her from the start of the movie which eliminates his confusion on his feelings during the school year...Hermoine prematurely spills the beans on her feelings for Ron which was only speculation in the novels...Lavender Brown becomes a obsessive and crazed girlfriend rather than simply over-affectionate (a reminiscent Unis from She's the Man)...the battle scene is missing from the end giving Dumbledore's death an anticlimactic feel making it all the more unemotional and disappointing...Harry hides under the floor simply holding his wand looking like a coward while Dumbledore dies, Snape sees him hiding rather than Harry being frozen under his cloak compliments of Dumbledore ...There is no funeral or break up with Ginny at the end of it (there is no relationship between the two either simply a kiss)...Hagrid is basically deleted from the movie as is Neville...Pensive trips are deleted and the Horocruxes are never explained, not even slightly...Luna finds Harry on the Hogwarts Express rather than Tonks...The Slug Club simply makes a cameo rather than a proper introduction and explanation...the Inferi look more like skeletons compared to the white bodies described in the book...I'm sure more discrepancies are present, however I can only remember so many of them.It is absolutely a horrible interpretation of the book and I hope that they look at all of the mistakes and gaps left for the next movie and fill them in with more than humor (they are supposed to be in the middle of an all out war aren't they?) I mean I didn't even feel emotional when Dumbledore was killed, I was too busy trying to figure out why Harry was acting like a stunned coward under the floor boards and not doing something, isn't that his thing...doing seemingly impossible rescue missions?!?!

1294,300,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5949227/,"Zack Snyder's epic spectacle about the Battle of Thermopylae in the fifth century BC, when the Spartan king Leonidas tried to stop the Persian army with three hundred soldiers, does not pretend to historical credibility, but is an adaptation of the comic book of the same name by Frank Miller. The film mimics the comic-book visuals, with an interesting use of colors and contrasts, spectacularly directed fight scenes, and the amount of ""monsters"", violence and gore that surpasses most of the slasher horrors I've seen. The criteria by which films receive R rating are quite puritanical and conservative, and in most cases, the reasons for this rating are ridiculous to me, but with the explicitness of violence and to some extent sex, ""300"" definitely deserves it. But although it has an epic atmosphere and is visually breathtaking, overall it is not particularly strong or impressive. I saw it about a decade ago, and now while watching it again I remembered almost nothing. The story and dialogues occasionally step in unconvincing and even a comic exaggeration, and I think it is too morbid for a story it tells. As a fan of horror and all kinds of twisted movies, it was somewhat suitable for me, but I don't recommend it to a faint-hearted audience and by no means for children.7,5/10",300
1295,Lord of War,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1310212/,"This portrait of a big time arms dealer of Ukrainian origin, Yuri Orlov, starring Nicolas Cage (whose performance holds your attention throughout), has many schlocky Hollylwood elements, such as Yuri's druggie brother Vitaly (Jared Leto) and his trophy wife (Bridget Moynahan), his numerous sexy conquests along the way to megawealth, his ""friendship"" with the dramatic president of Liberia (Eamonn Walker), and the ridiculously relentless and steely Interpol agent who pursues him (Ethan Hawke). All these are colorful exhibits rather then people. The slickness of the decor and cinematography impress pointlessly. Cage's narration is full of tendentious declarations, like ""The problem with dating dream girls is that they have a tendency to become real."" Or ""I would tell you to go to hell, but I think you're already there."" Some of the zingers fall flat or are just obvious, like ""I sell to leftists, and I sell to rightists. I even sell to pacifists, but they're not the most regular customers,"" or ""There are two types of tragedies in life. One is not getting what you want, the other is getting it. "" There is more than enough of that, and you have to be pretty easily impressed to like it. The movie also sometimes revels in the evils it depicts. But it includes some significant home truths about world politics like the fact that the world's biggest arms dealers are the US, UK, France, Russia, and China, and they are also the permanent members of the UN Security Council. Some of the cynicism in this movie is pretty strong stuff. It certainly doesn't lull you.",Lord of War
1296,Saw,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0973120/,"Wow. The critics weren't wrong. Not since seven has horror been portrayed so majestically. From the first minute to last this film twists and turns you till you feel rather poorly. Just like 'Se7en', the all-round Grittiness that director James Wan creates disgusts and enthralls. Just like 'Se7en', there is a H U G E twist that makes your blood curdle. A lack of star names helps the movie flow as the pace builds to a finale that won't be forgotten by this viewer in a hurry! I still can't sleep. It is well scripted, well acted, and, for everyone who guesses the killer after the first few minutes, keeps you guessing right up to the final reel. It is better than Seven for shock value. It is not over the top gory but there is a final scene which makes you sweat. Very highly recommended!",N/A
1297,"Synecdoche, New York",https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2342920/,"INITIAL IMPRESSION:This is the film that the Charlie Kaufman from Adaptation wanted to write.In Adaptation he tries to tell his agent, ""I don't want to cram in sex or guns or car chases, or characters you know, learning profound life lessons or growing or coming to like each other or overcoming obstacles to succeed in the end. I mean the book isn't like that, and life isn't like that. You know, it just isn't. And I feel very strongly about this."" In addition, about 40 minutes into Adaptation, Charlie Kaufman's character describes himself as self-indulgent, narcissistic, solipsistic and pathetic because he's written himself into his screenplay. It seems like Caden is just him again inside his own screenplay but unlike Adaptation this one has no change or drama or story and people do not succeed in the end.While in Adaptation Charlie Kaufman gave in to McKee and his twin brother Donald, it seems in Synecdoche he's decided to instead make a work of art his way, period. On principle I agree with this decision but feel he took it too far. There's a point at which you can overdo it.WHY I DIDN'T LIKE IT:At first, it's easy to get caught up in the puzzles embedded in Synecodche. Why is the house on fire? Who's writing in the girls' diary? What's the deal with the therapist? You might get the impression that beneath these puzzles, Kaufman is hiding some deep truth. Unfortunately, there's nothing there, and the puzzles are simply distractions.As Kaufman is committed to expressing his own point of view he is therefore unwilling to let the actors express theirs. Like Caden, Kaufman is off in his own head, obsessing over his thoughts without paying attention to the world outside. It seemed like one meaningless scene after meaningless scene. If that was the point then fine, but that is about as entertaining as a movie about the glory of watching paint dry.WHO MAY ENJOY IT:There was one theme that stuck out of the whole film that made me feel like this piece was made for the cynics and for those who agree with the sentiments of the main character. Perhaps because I do not fall into that category I did not form a bond with Synecdoche.Examples of this are when Caden is explaining his vision to the actors and says, ""What was once before you - an exciting, mysterious future - is now behind you. Lived; understood; disappointing. You realize you are not special. You have struggled into existence, and are now slipping silently out of it. This is everyone's experience. Every single one. The specifics hardly matter. Everyone's everyone."" The other was said by the wife to Caden, when under her breath she muttered something like, ""the more you get to know people the more disappointed you are"".","Synecdoche, New York"
1298,Mysterious Skin,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1728049/,"I see all these very favourable comments and high marks and I can't help but wonder what all the people saw in this movie. I mean, yeah, it approaches pedophilia in a very direct way, the performances are good, the directing is good, but most of the film was utterly boring.One could see the ending of the movie from a mile away and I stood through all the story to find out exactly what the twist will be, but there was no twist, only a sudden closure of plot, a total stop.My guess is that if the subject of pedophilia would not be such a scary and fascinating taboo in American culture, this film would not have been received in such a (in my opinion) over positive way.Bottom line: be prepared for some shocking images like pedo, homosexual sex, even rape, and a lot of boring stuff in between. The entire child abuse part is really well detailed as well as the psychological trauma, but that's about it.",N/A
1299,Mysterious Skin,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1165288/,"I have a feeling that most of the reviewers here have not read the text of ""Mysterious Skin"" by Scott Heim. Doing so would be most helpful in viewing this film.Out of sheer luck, I happened to find a screening in Las Vegas, almost a year after the initial release, having finished the book only one day before. It was an interesting experience from the start.One got the feeling of stepping into an adult cinema, instead of a semi-mainstream release. I was surrounded by sprinkling of older guys watching an NC-17 matinée. A first for me, for sure. The movie captures the feel of the book spot on. Director Araki should be commended for staying so close to the text. Hardly anything was left out and what was deleted did not detract from the storyline in the least.Heim's novel deals with subject matter that most people would prefer to deny exists. But back here in the real world, it does. On screen we see the sensualization of an 8 year old boy, along with his sexual fantasy. Not for the squeamish, but Araki communicates this brilliantly without diluting the message. Most people would shy away from a story that has an 8 year old boy having an orgasm as he watched his mother have intercourse, but Araki does not. And somehow he makes it okay.Hats off to the boys cast as the young Neil and Brian. Chase Ellison captures the emotions of his character very well. He captures the darkness of Neil McCormick incredibly, and translates perfectly from the written page. We sense the confusion turning into acceptance and then, desire. It made me squirm in my seat. George Webster as young Brian is great.I can't imagine a lot of actors lining up to play the boylover coach, but Bill Sage does very well. In the story, his role doesn't seem like a pure predator, but clearly he has devices at work. He's in the right place at the right time.Joseph Gordon-Levitt is a marvel is this film. There was a genuine quality to his character, an aloofness that comes with knowledge at an early age that is hard to put into words. Brady Corbett successfully brought his youthful character along, and I think his interactions with the other characters is spot on for someone who had had an experience like his.Critics will say that this film glorifies pedophilia. I disagree. I think it shows the effects of pedophilic relationship on different people, and how they react to it. It is a slice of life, albeit a very dark one, that does occur each and every day. Approach with caution and an open mind.",Mysterious Skin
1300,Love Me If You Dare,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2158062/,"In his first screenplay and directing experience, director Yann Samuell supports the belief of everlasting love relations. If we analyze his powerful script; he wants lovers to find their true love, since they can do this only once in a lifetime. He encourages us to believe that the more time passes, the more powerful the relationship is; and that's why he cuts out the classic foundation of love at the first sight and makes fun of it. Everything is OK up to here, but his plot only lacks in reality where it was necessary to bind destiny with love. Afterwards this question stays unanswered: ""If we decide to stay loyal(in heart) to our first love without believing in destiny, and keep returning to him/her after failed relationship trials to heal our wounds; how can we know he/she is our true love?"". I'll add this question to discussion board under A Study of Love & Destiny.Romance movies never makes sense for me, as romance novels do. Although, we have a senseful and sensible story beginning in this one. There is a 7 year-old girl named Sophie; who is known as a very killjoy,proud,indifferent child. Across the heart, there is a nasty but very sensitive 7 year-old boy named Juline; both going to the same elementary school. Julien meets with Sophie while her friends making off-color humour with her. He gives a care for her, but she doesn't even take a blind bit of notice at first. Though afterwards, when she realizes that she can have fun with him all the time; she starts spending time with him day by day. At age 7, they start a game of gameness, which will last for a life-time.For their unity had begun by means of games, one day at age 17, Sophie left Julien challenging him to question how can she be sure that he's seriously in love with her. By that time Julien hadn't realized that Sophie was having maturational crisis. Yet in Jeux d'enfants, the methods of communication through love is so impressive that sooner or later they both understand that they're meant for each other. There are signature scenes and moments in between their reunion times with an excellent transfer of Surrealism into storyboard sequences.Even though they both betrayed on each other, they keep their game just like keeping a secret deep in their hearts. This became crucial to accept when the social and sociological obstacles happened to put an end to their game. Whereas, they realize the meaning of love is to go after your lover no matter how hard the situation is. They put an end to their life together at the end to be able to stay loyal to their game.",Love Me If You Dare
1301,Love Me If You Dare,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0921537/,"I love this film. It's light, dreamy, and colorful. The movie does not ask you to take it seriously, but simply to watch as Julien and Sophie play with the elements of conventional life. I'm reminded of a character from Milan Kundera's Immortality, who played with the world in the same fervor and commitment. We see Julien and Sophie's games becoming more and more elaborate as they grow up, affecting other lives even. And when they do, you understand at most levels that they do not mean to hurt other people. They just play as the game is supposed to be played.It is fantasy in that it lets you suspend realism for a moment, and dwell on the things we take for granted many times- laughter, romance, and childlike innocence. This movie made me smile, and I have no need to question motivations etc. It would be absurd to questions things that are meant to be left alone in their wonder.",N/A
1302,A Very Long Engagement,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0972921/,"Un long dimanche de fiançailles mixes romance and mystery amid the brutal realities of World War I, and though it's a solid film, it never reaches the greatness it strives for so earnestly. Unlike most of Jeunet's other films, it takes itself too seriously, lacking much of the director's wonderful humor and imagination. For some reason, Jeunet also comes too close in theme and setting to two much better works on World War I by Bertrand Tavernier: La Vie et rien d'autre (Life and Nothing But), in which a woman searches for her missing husband in the aftermath of the war, and Capitaine Conan, about a group of French soldiers at the time of the Armistice and beyond. In fact, the opening sequences of Un long dimanche de fiançailles that take place in the hellish fox holes on the front line look like they have been lifted from leftover footage from Capitaine Conan. I'm not sure why Jeunet would do this. Unfortunately for him, Capitaine Conan is one of the greatest films about war ever made and La Vie et rien d'autre has an emotional power and complexity that only serve to make one aware of how little of the same Jeunet is able to achieve in his own work.Audrey Tautou is charming, of course, and one enjoys watching her on the screen, but she has to carry this heavy film on her back, without much complexity in her character to explore or another strong actor to work against. One also wonders if she will get stuck playing ""Amelie"" the rest of her career. She's a wonderful actress, but I find myself wanting to see her in a dark action film along the lines of Nikita. Something besides the same role over and over.One of the few times Tautou gets a break in the film is when we meet Jodie Foster's character and spend some time with her story. This is one of the best parts of the film, and if the rest of the movie had had the same emotional urgency and passion as this sequence, it would have been a much stronger work.Jeunet could also have spent more time on Manech and the other four soldiers around him. Their stories are interesting but it's hard to follow who is who at times, and we never develop a strong emotional connection with them. More time with them and less with Tautou's Mathilde might have helped the film move a little better. One of Jeunet's strengths in Delicatessen and Amelie was creating a terrific and dynamic rhythm. This movie drags much more than it has to, getting slower (and a bit disjointed) towards the end. The role of the detective, Germain Pire, provides a bit of comic relief and an element of mystery, but Jeunet pretty much abandons the character after a couple of scenes. The mystery aspect of the film is handled poorly in general, Jeunet turning something that could have been a real advantage into a dawdling storyline that holds little or no suspense.Visually, Jeunet does a great job again, though there aren't as many striking moments as in his earlier works. The most resonant image in the film involves a soldier carving the initials of his beloved into a battle-blasted tree trunk in the middle of a grey, apocalyptic wasteland between the French and German fronts. And while the battle scenes are sometimes powerful, there is the sense that we have seen this all before.Un long dimanche de fiançailles was an interesting choice for Jeunet's first movie after Amelie. From a commercial perspective, it seems like a risky choice, especially given the participation of Warner Brothers in putting up money for the film. This is definitely not a ready-made hit - the movie is too long and slow for that. Many fans of Amelie will probably walk away disappointed. I respect his willingness to take such chances, but I wish he had chosen a project that wasn't so melodramatic and pretentious in the end.And one whose plot and war theme hadn't already been done better by another director. A decent but but not great film.",A Very Long Engagement
1303,A Very Long Engagement,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0982981/,"Director Jean-Pierre Jeunet in the hit, ""Amelie,"" employed scintillating Audrey Tatou, the most expressive young French actress in film today, to portray a whimsical and charming girl-woman in search of love. With her now as a young French rural ingénue searching for years after The Great War (aka World War I or, even better, The War to End All Wars) for a probably killed fiancé, Jeunet crafted a moving, often penetrating story centering on the charnel carnage of trench warfare.Lame as a single-digit-age child because of polio and living with relatives who took over after her parents were killed in an accident, Mathilde is befriended by Manech (Gasparad Ulliel). Mathilde, a loner separated from her peers by her disability, and Manech become closest friends. Late adolescence brings love and lust, commitment and an engagement.But in 1917 the French Army needed fresh meat for the bloody maw that was warfare on the almost terminally static Western Front. And off went Manech along with many others who never returned.Employing the harshest discipline of any Western army in modern history, the French Army (which gave the world the Dreyfus trial and in World War I actually used decimation to punish mutinous regiments and divisions) sentences Manech and four others to be cast into No Man's Land without weapons, without any possibility of being allowed to return but with the macabre requirement that they respond to morning roll call if alive (not a good bet). Their alleged crime was self-mutilation to get out of combat (what we call in the American military, ""SIW,"" Self-Inflicted Wounds).Mathilde in 1920, steely faithful in a moving and believable way, searches fervently for her fiancé whom she believes ""must"" be alive somewhere, somehow. Employing artful stratagems and enlisting the willing, the paid and the dragooned, her search takes her to cities and battlefields. With resort to a child's employment of magical thinking she frequently whispers tests about what will happen in immediate, ordinary circumstances with one result ""proving"" for her that Manech is still alive. Tatou makes this self-deception appealing and infinitely sad.As Spielberg did in ""Saving Private Ryan,"" Jeunet brings the immediacy of the meat-grinding battlefield to the viewer over and over again through superb if sometimes difficult to watch cinematography. Of course no film truly captures the desperation, the epidemic fatality that gripped and demoralized the French Army after years of immobile, set-piece fighting. One needs to read Robert Graves or Siegfried Sassoon for that. But Jeunet has brought to the screen the most realistic World War I trench scenes since ""All Quiet on the Western Front"" (the 1930 original, of course).Tatou is an acting tsunami here, alternately beguiling and tense and always hopeful while fighting despair. Expect to see her in many fine roles in the future. She's marvelous.The entire cast is excellent-few are known in the U.S. A remarkable movie with an ending that will satisfy and disturb at the same time.Tatou and Jeunet deserve Oscar nominations.10/10",N/A

1307,Sympathy for Mr. Vengeance,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0859510/,"Vengeance is one of humanity's more lamentable instincts, and one we'll have to overcome as a species one day. When one acts out of vengeance one seeks only to hurt, and when people start hurting each other because they're hurt themselves, everybody ends up hurting and nobody really gains anything.I think that's the main message Park Chan-Wook wants us to take away from SYMPATHY FOR MR. VENGEANCE, though the movie is complex and oblique and doubtless open to many interpretations. It is a challenging movie in many ways - the story is never spelled out clearly, leaving the viewer to deduce many key events and motivations. Dialogue is sparse, and this is not solely attributable to the fact that the main character is deaf and dumb. The movie also challenges - almost terrorises - with its bleakness and occasional scenes of quite disturbing violence and gore.SFMV is an ambitious project, and one that doesn't fit into any established cinematic mould. The story, characters, themes and aesthetics are all very unusual and creative. I can't think of any other film that's quite like it, though at times I likened the experience to that of watching certain Takashi Miike movies. Actually, Kim Ki-Duk's movies are probably the closest point of reference, though Park Chan-Wook's film is smarter.SYMPATHY FOR MR. VENGEANCE is not a movie I'd choose for a movie night with friends, or one that I'd lend or recommend to most of the people I know. Perhaps I'm unfair in my assessment of my friends, but I can't think of many that would enjoy it. Actually I'm surprised that the film is held in such wide regard, as its not a conventional film or an easy film, and is far more art than entertainment. In my experience that narrows a film's audience significantly, but I've yet to hear anybody express a negative reaction to the film. I guess originality and technical virtuosity are still appreciated after all - perhaps more so by those that have gravitated to Korean cinema in recent years than in other groups, since they are most often to be found there.With JSA and SFMV, Park Chan-Wook has definitely shown himself to be one of the brightest figures in the new wave of Korean directors. Both are very well crafted in pretty much every respect. The cast of SFMV also deserve commendation for their performances, which are all good. Song Kang-Ho steals the show with a wonderfully understated performance, though.Recommended, but make sure you know what you're getting.",Sympathy for Mr. Vengeance

That being said, I felt that this movie was by far one of the most touching and entertaining movies I have seen in my short 22 years. The cast is fabulous, every actor plays his/her part so to speak. The story centers around J. M. Barrie, creator of Peter Pan, and his journey to writing the well-known play. It highlights his genius, while also showing the painful isolation that comes with being a mind ahead of your time. There are some liberties taken when put against the actual events that led up to the birth of Peter Pan, but don't let this dissuade you from watching--""Finding Neverland"" was never slated as being a documentary! Being a huge Johnny Depp fan, one would think that my judgment would be tainted by his involvement in the film. However, even I can admit to a failed Depp movie (i.e. The Secret Window). At first, I thought that putting Depp outside of his usual character type, a mildly strange pirate/writer/doctor/investigator/man with scissors for hands, might signify a substandard film. Boy was I wrong! He nailed J.M. Barrie and was absolutely captivating throughout the entire film. I hate to sound like a starry-eyed fan but I thought his performance in this movie was downright Oscar-worthy! Depp is magnificent, but he does not carry the weight of this film on his own.

What if there's an alternate life for you somewhere, out there, where the cumulative sum of your choices leads to a better reality, a happier and more fulfilling existence? On the flip-side - what if, at the end of the day, you really can't achieve a solid grip on these things, no matter how hard you try?A great deal of science fiction works of art have tried to approach these meaningful questions throughout the years, all presenting many philosophical ideas and notions as to how one man can change his own fate, for better or for worse. In this surprisingly good sci-fi adventure from 2004, directors Eric Bress and J. Mackye Gruber (who are also behind the screenplay of Final Destination 2) raise all these questions once again, but use a different angle this time around. Time travel is not the issue here. Instead, our lead protagonist, Evan Treborn (portrayed by Hollywood prankster Ashton Kutcher  but more on that later) leads his whole life up until his early 20's without knowing he has a rare medical condition that seemingly helps him shut away traumatic incidents that occurred throughout his childhood and adolescence years. All he remembers from these various occasions are bizarre blackouts. But when a blast from his past comes back into his life only to leave it ever so tragically (Kayleigh Miller, portrayed by the lovely Amy Smart who we've since seen in films such as Just Friends and Crank), Evan learns that he can return to those important lost moments in his life and re-inhabit his younger body, thus changing the present and future. However, with every shift in the past comes an alternate present that may seem better at first, but is in fact a far harsher reality than the original one Evan has left.What truly touched me about this film was the essence in which it captured the troublesome youth of my generation, that was born in the 1980's, grew up in the 1990's, and is ever since trying to adapt to the ever changing reality in which we all live in. Here, one man tries to alter all this, and his own personal journey is parallel in many ways to the journey many young people go through nowadays. Part of capturing this Generation X notion is the pop-culture presented throughout the film. When you see the young actors and actress fall in love, fight, and grow up real fast, it all happens amidst references to films of the period (Se7en, etc.), outfits, 1980's technology and other devices that fill you up with an overwhelming feeling of nostalgia and sentiment, as if you were there yourself, living these events and going through all these horrible/wonderful events.Above all things, the makers of The Butterfly Effect do the unbelievable and turn Ashton Kutcher into a good actor  a feat I thought was unachievable at best. However, in this sci-fi epic it appears as though anything is possible. Bottom line, it was a fresh breath of air when I saw it, left me pondering for days, and gave me the inspiration and write something myself after a long period of writers block. If a film manages to be this inspirational and keep you on the edge of your seat throughout its 113 minutes duration, all I can do is humbly bow down in front of its makers' talents. I'm eagerly waiting for other outings by these young folks.",The Butterfly Effect
1311,28 Days Later...,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0821780/,"I'm amazed there are so many negative reviews of this film; I thought it succeeded on every level. It's artistic and atmospheric, with a great pace, sympathetic characters, and a fantastic climax. The music is very nicely done, and, to me, the eerie opening scenes of the empty London streets are worth the price of admission all on their own. I'm a stubborn viewer, and, normally, when a film benefits from early critical buzz in the manner that this one did, I find some excuse not to like it. But not this time; I'm completely impressed. (Incidentally, I think it's interesting that while most horror films these days seem to have been inspired by knockoffs of knockoffs, ""28 Days Later"" apparently owes more to John Wyndham's classic disaster novel ""The Day of the Triffids"" than to anything else. And that's a good thing.) HIGHLY recommended.",28 Days Later
1312,Battle Royale,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1048650/,"Battle Royale, or Batoru Rowaiaru as named in Japan, was a pretty cool Japanese action flick. Most of the special effects were pretty awesome looking, but a few could be considered a bit cheesy, such as the over splattering of blood. Believe it or not, the movie actually had it's funny moments as well. The instructional video from the overly perky girl telling the rules of the death game was a pretty funny bit. Usually the humor from Japanese movies can escape me, but I liked the humor here quite a bit, at least until the action and killing started.The premise of the movie is that, due to escalating violence in schools, a law is passed which allows the military, or some kind of militia, to take one troubled class and turn them all loose on an island with the object of killing each other until one is standing. They have 3 days to complete their objective or they all die.As the game begins, every 6 hours there is an update on which classmates were killed and how many were left. These updates also alert the students to danger zones, which are just places you do not want to be when the time comes. The students are all issued a survival pack and a random weapon as well. Some weapons are horrible and useless and some would be great to have in a situation of this kind.The main characters are Shuya Nanahara (Tatsuya Fujiwara) & Noriko Nakagawa (Aki Maeda) who are close friends and refuse to kill each other. The game is also somewhat rigged with the addition of two ""ringers"". One of whom plays for fun, another who has another reason. Basically, one good and one evil. The good one is named Shougo Kawada (Taro Yamamoto) and helps the students who he does not find a threat. Also, Chiaki Kuriyama (Gogo Yubari from Kill Bill) puts in an amazing performance. I can see why Quentin Tarantino chose her for his movie based on this part here.Overall, I really liked this movie - violence, action, humor and all with very few complaints or annoyances. I can recommend this movie with a clear conscience. 8.5/10",Battle Royale

1314,The Royal Tenenbaums,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0770856/,"I had all the best intentions of enjoying this film, as I have always admired the talent of Wes Anderson. That said, I can only state that as black comedies go, this isn't even beige. Did anyone tell Wes Anderson and Owen Wilson their screenplay was just plain boring? Mr. Anderson perhaps had something else in mind when he thought about this project. The idea of a dysfunctional family sounds great, but in the treatment of the material on screen, it doesn't materialize. It's about one of the dullest films of the year, in spite of the overblown praise from all critics toward this movie, which does not come up to Mr. Anderson's previous directing efforts.It's a shame because of all the talent amassed in this picture. The best thing in it is Gene Hackman. He is an actor that's always interesting to watch. His Royal Tenenbaum is not a fully formed character, but I would pay to see Mr. Hackman read from the Yellow Pages any time rather than to see him in a misguided attempt at comedy.Gwyneth Paltrow character is bo-ring. And so are the brothers Wilson, and Ben Stiller. Angelica Houston is very dignified in her role, but you don't believe for a nanosecond that after what she went through with Royal, she would walk to the altar ever again. Bill Murray and Jason Schwartzman, who were so incredible in Rushmore don't have anything to do here. The narrative device is sophomoric at best. So the best advice to all the fans is to wait until it comes out in DVD. Who knows, it might even play better....",The Royal Tenenbaums

1316,Y Tu Mamá También,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0728046/,"Alfonso Cuaron is simply one of the best Mexican directors in recent years in Mexican film production. His incredible AIDS-driven comedy, ""Solo Con Tu Pareja"" was maybe the most funny Mexican picture in a long time, and his always present criticism to the way of life of Mexican people in a city such as Mexico City, is incredible accurate and clever. His other projects in the United States, ""Little Princess"" and ""Great Expectations"" were beautifully-manufactured motion pictures, with the help (or support, if you may) of the marvellous photographer Emmanuel Lubenzki (""Sleepy Hollow"", and the above-mentioned Cuaron movies). Returning to his home country this time, Cuaron displays such magic and poetic visuals, in contrast with the subtle criticism to the society in Mexico, and the clever and sharp dialogs between the leading stars, using every word young Mexicans use to apply in their conversations.""Y Tu Mama Tambien"" (And Your Mother Too) is, in the surface, a really funny story about 2 friends-almost-brothers, Tenoch Iturbide (an outstanding Diego Luna) and Julio (a really incredible performance for the recent Ariel, the Mexican Academy Award, winner Gael Garcia Bernal, in another excellent portray of a young guy with ""issues""), that plan a trip to an imaginary beach, ""Boca del Cielo"" (Heaven´s Mouth) in order to flirt with a Spanish girl, married with Tenoch's cousin, and portrayed by a credible Maribel Verdu.But this is only the ""surface"" of this road movie. In fact, we are dealing with dreams and realities, with social problems and political ones. Tenoch is a young guy living with a millionaire family, son of a wealthy businessman with friends in the highest ""stairs"" of Mexican politics, with a second name such as Iturbide (one of the most important and powerful leaders of Mexican politic history). And, in contrast, Julio  is a middle-low-class guy, living with his mother, brothers and sisters, in a small department, with a last name such as Zapata (a revolutionary leader in Mexican history, with native origins, that took part in the Revolution at the beginning of 20th Century). This is a clever and sharp critic of the different models of living of these 2 friends, and in fact, of all Mexican citizens (I know it, because I'm Mexican, too).Also, the movie has an excellent narration by Daniel Gimenez Cacho, star of a previous Cuaron film, ""Solo Con Tu Pareja"", that explains the things we cannot see, but that we can understand and feel. The ""subtle critic about Mexican society and traditions"" that I have talked about all along this comment, is the one thing that makes this picture go from a funny comedy to an intelligent essay of the lives of young people, social classes, discovery and re-discovery of personality and our own soul, and the final revelation of who we are and what we become when time passes by. In the lives of Julio and Tenoch there is no redemption, but a clear message of their goal in life, their true feelings about friendship, and their sexuality. This road trip is only a pretext to tell a story about discovery and finding our true nature.Yes, maybe it is a little provocative and bold, but because of these characteristics, ""And Your Mother Too"" is an incredible motion picture, true to its meaning and compromised with the reality it is trying to show. We care about this people, we care about their problems, and at the end, we care about our own society, and we care about what we have become with time. And the true meaning of the movie's title, ""And Your Mother Too"", within the narrative of the film, is simply hilarious.Give this movie a chance, and see it. You won't be disappointed. It has an excellent direction, excellent photography, its is very sexy, it showcases credible performances by all its cast. But above all, it has a real story, real character development, and real power. One great movie from a great Mexican director. Maybe not his best, but really near.",Y Tu Mama Tambien

The first half, or even three quarters, seemed to move along a bit slowly, but it felt necessary to build the suspense to the point where I was biting my nails in anticipation of the inevitable.Nicole Kidman's character, Grace... I was torn between empathy and disgust for her at times, but she definitely succeeded at captivating me with their lives and story.  Predictable in parts, but it still leaves you guessing. This was a quality ghost story, with an old fashioned ambiance; downright spooky. I was in awe of the ending, a fairly intelligent premise.

He was a greedy, manipulative, money-grubbing drug dealer and the film conveniently leaves out the FACT that he and his partner, Diego, actually MURDERED several people who interfered with their business, and destroyed countless other lives directly or indirectly through the incredible amounts of cocaine they sold. He got 60 years in Otisville because he deserved 60 years in Otisville.That aside, this movie has a coolness factor that has assured its place in my collection.Notables: Depp's airport-walk to the tune of ""Black Betty"", the Mexico ""i don't need a little, a need a LOT"" scene, and all the California stuff (""I'm a stewardess...i'm a stewardess...im a stewardess...""",Blow

Tom Cruise is fantastic, Colin Farrell is amazing, as well as Samantha Morton. Spielberg again proves that he is the master of cinema. A truly great director.

The struggle that Ruben Carter endured just puts light on the way things used to be, and makes really grateful that things have improved. Denzel's great!I completely felt in love with this movie, in which you can find extreme endurance, strong courage, ultimate love and a very realistic character starred by Washington. The character not only shows how powerful spirit a human being can be to survive in harsh situations, how persistent should a man in desperate circumstances, but also bring strong feeling to watchers, who wanna do something better, something higher than what he is currently doing.

1324,The Hurricane,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0602578/,"Jewison's film is an old-fashioned biopic, complete with pivotal backstory, voiceover narration, and a character who enters the protagonist's life and changes it immeasurably.  It's one of those stand-up-and-cheer movies where everyone seems to be against the hero, but above all odds (and with more than a little help from some of his friends), he rises above The System and gets his belated due.  It's an oft-used scenario, with many scenes that could easily have been taken from Jewison's other films A SOLDIER'S STORY or IN THE HEAT OF THE NIGHT.  Yet despite the familiarity of the storyline, I'll be damned if I wasn't choking back tears of elation at the movie's triumphant conclusion.  It's a masterful piece of filmmaking that proves Norman Jewison's skill as a director, as he transcends the cliche-bound script and, with the help of Washington and company, makes it a powerful entity all its own.As the Hurricane, Denzel Washington proves he is one of the best actors (if not THE best) in the business today.  He can run the gamut from cold hatred to hearty laughter like few others can. He brings dignity and class to every one of his pictures (he was the only thing worth watching in THE BONE COLLECTOR).  Here, he makes you FEEL every single thing he's feeling.  In times of righteous indignation, you feel morally outraged alongside him.  When he's at his most vulnerable, you can feel your throat constricting and your eyes watering.  He has an uncanny knack for reaching into your soul and making you part of the picture itself; it's almost as if he's channelling the viewer while acting.  Other actors delight in wowing the audience with grand theatrics and histrionics, but neglect to make the audience care; Denzel is usually soft-spoken and low-key, but always holds your attention.In summary, THE HURRICANE was one of the most exhilarating motion picture experiences I've had all year.  Norman Jewison directs with a deft surehandedness reminiscent of his late 1960s/early 1970s glory years, Denzel Washington delivers perhaps the most awe-inspiring performance of the year, and the audience goes home happy and feeling good about themselves and the world.

1325,American Psycho,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1888025/,"A very funny horror flick. A worthy companion piece to its literary roots. A phenomenal, fearless performance by Christian Bale that, in a way, cleared up my questions about this versatile British actor. I could never quite warm up to him. Not even in ""Little Women"". Now, Bale as Patrick Bateman, revealed the reason. It is the cruelty around his mouth. His smiles are chilling and they work to perfection in this, his yuppie modern monster.His actions have the pristine shallowness of his business cards and the disgusting taste of his self awareness. You don't feel sorry for him, the way one did for Norman Bates. No, his character is unredeemable.

Additionally, the satire was to show that everyone at the time was extremely narcissistic and superficial.

1327,The Thin Red Line,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0473920/,"The greatest fault of The Thin Red Line was its timing - it was released at around the same time as Spielberg's Saving Private Ryan.  While most people dismissed The Thin Red Line as the `other' World War II movie of 1998, it's actually a very different kind of film - the film itself is not hurt by similarity to Ryan but was hurt commercially due to the misconception. It's easy to forget that Red was nominated for seven Oscars.  This is an extraordinary film that can stand well on its own next to Ryan.Saving Private Ryan was significant in that it visually depicted war in a realistic, gritty way.  The Thin Red Line's focus is more philosophical. It is about the contradiction between the beauty of nature and the destructive nature of men.  The movie cuts continuously between the external struggle of American GIs fighting to take a crucial hill from Japanese occupation on Guadalcanal - and more importantly, the internal chaos of war as every man tries to come to his own terms about matters such as morals, death, God, and love.Unlike in Saving Private Ryan, there is nothing patriotic about this movie. In fact, there probably has never been a more anti-war film.  The fighting men here are disillusioned, lost, and frightened.  They don't fight for their country or ""democracy"" - they fight because they have to.  The only priorities are survival, and - for the more humane - caring for their comrades.  Renowned composer Hans Zimmer - who won an Oscar nomination for his work-captures the grim mood perfectly and allows us to hear the men's thoughts.The characters are portrayed by a strong ensemble cast.  Acting is uniformly excellent, especially Nick Nolte as Colonel Tall, who is the unfeeling commander of the ground offensive on Guadalcanal. Thoroughly unlikable, he is the closest thing to a villain in the movie.  After studying war for an untold number of years, Tall sees Guadalcanal as his chance to prove himself and move up in the ranks - the men are only a tool to accomplish this goal and expendable.  In one crucial scene, he orders a captain (played by Elias Koteas, in another outstanding role) to lead his men to a frontal assault against a Japanese controlled hill.  When the captain suggests a more logical alternative, the colonel screams: ""You are not gonna take your men around in the jungle to avoid a goddamn fight!""  To this, the captain replies, `I've lived with these men, sir, for two and a half years and I will not order them all to their deaths.'  Later, when the hill is taken, he is dismissed of his duties as Tall sees him as a threat to the successful achievement of his goal.  Certainly, not every commander must have been that coldhearted and selfish, but surely some were, though not necessarily to that extreme.While the acting is very good, much of the cast is relatively unknown and it can initially be hard to distinguish the characters from each other as they may appear to be very similar.  They are all about the same age, have dirt smeared over their faces, and wear helmets and the same military garb. Also, the stars in this movie have very small roles.  George Clooney and John Travolta are credited with starring roles while really little more than extras - clearly for marketing purposes.  You will not see more than two minutes of each.One of the main themes of the movie is the contrast between nature and men's destructiveness in war.  The director, Terrence Malick, hired cinematographer John Toll to capture this on camera, and towards achieving that goal they couldn't have been more successful.  The almost surreal scenery is nothing short of stunning and has the same visual impact as any special effect.  The beauty of nature is always present, even when it is a setting for battle of destruction, and death.Though the battle scenes fall short of the frightening realism in Saving Private Ryan, they are heads and soldiers above every previous attempt. One truly gets the sense that war is a chaotic, often hopeless environment where it is only a matter of luck whether you survive or get killed.
`How did we lose the good that was given us? Or let it slip away? Scatter it carelessly ... trade it for what has no worth?'  The film is filled with such poetic questions as to which there are no real answers.  This is definitely not a party movie.  There isn't anything uplifting about it - it is downright depressing.  Asides from entertainment value, however, this is a film that makes you think.",The Thin Red Line
1328,Mulan,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1671328/,"In the 1990s, I felt that Disney made quite a few undistinguished cartoons following Aladdin. Unlike most of the world, I wasn't all that enamored with THE LION KING and subsequent offerings such as the wretched HUNCHBACK OF NOTRE DAME and POCAHONTAS were huge disappointments. Sure, POCAHONTAS is a lovely film to watch, but it's so wrong historically and it's so politically correct and hokey. And as for HUNCHBACK, the story was so dark and unappealing, I have no idea WHO the intended audience was. So it was in this context that I expected to hate or at least be underwhelmed by MULAN. Instead, it seemed fresh, well-made, humorous and fun--something distinctly missing from these other films. While the anachronistic aspect of having a lady warrior is problematic, for once Disney had another strong and likable female lead following Belle in BEAUTY AND THE BEAST. This was a definite home-run for Disney and well worth your time whether you are a child or an adult.",Mulan
1329,Mulan,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0953845/,"I was impressed by this Disney film for so many reasons, too many to list here, but I will go on the record as saying that Mulan has got to be one of the best Disney female characters that ever saw production, in the midst of a colorful and artistic film, that will resonate in your memory.Mulan sticks out in my mind for this reason. For once, we have a strong female lead, or at the least, stronger than most of them. She isn't counted among the Disney ""princesses"" line-up. She doesn't want for herself, and she seeks to look deeper within herself to discover her inner being. She isn't like Ariel, who wants to be someone else. She isn't like Jasmine, who sits in luxury, waiting to be swept off her feet by Prince Charming, just like Snow White, Cinderella, Sleeping Beauty, and almost any female character that Disney brings to life. And while she does share some traits among this list, she stands out because she does something that these do not. She uses her mind. Mulan, in fact, has more in common with male Disney leads than the female Disney leads. Mulan is a thinker, and a do-er. She's resourceful, like Aladdin. She is quick to act, like Eric (mermaid.) And she sacrifices herself for the sake of others, like Hercules. She also speaks her mind, even in a culture that does not allow such a thing. She doesn't waste time pining about ""will I ever find true love?"" Indeed, we see that she has an attraction to Shang (as he was her husband in the legends,) but we see her uncomfortable and unsure of meeting the Match-maker. She begs for her father's life when Chi-Fu came to the village. When you see her make her decision to take her father's place in the army, she does so out of her love for him, valuing his life above hers. She doesn't wish to become a man to see what it is like or for a change. Only to save his life. She later doubts herself and her reasons for going, but she did so because of her inner strengths, something other female Disney leads too often lack. (And it is these strengths that Shang is attracted to at the end.)This movie also has a simple, but very effective villain, Shan Yu. Though not as memorable as Jafar or Ursula, he is more effective and more menacing because he is not fantastic. By that, I mean that he is not magical, he holds no special power. He is portrayed as a man, and as a man that could have truly existed, performing vicious acts that men do. We see the destruction that his army lays to a village, and when Mulan finds the doll, it shows that Shan Yu left no one living, man, woman or child. This is what makes him so effective as a villain, showing how truly human he indeed is. Granted, the producers did not develop him in any great depth, but they showed enough of him to remind us of his threat to China. Besides, sometimes the better villains are the ones you don't know too much about, or see a lot of.Of the rest of the supporting cast, I will only mention four of them as being memorable in any real way. Chi-Fu, the emperor's consultant, was a reminder of the way many men looked at women in this culture. He thrusts his head up when Mulan begs for her father's life, and when she is discovered to be a woman, though she is a hero, he is quick to insult her, and to order her execution, simply because she impersonated a man. The other three were, of course, her comrades, Ling, Yao, and Chian Po. Though they were mainly comic relief (almost like a 3 stooges set,) they remained loyal to Mulan and trusted her fully, even after she was discovered. I like them, because they were not discriminatory to her in any way, even trying to stop her execution. When Mulan told them she had an idea to help the emperor faster, they were the first to her side, even when Shang was still reluctant to do so.Overall, a wonderful movie to the Disney list. If you haven't seen it, then do so, you won't regret it.And yes, Mushu was a cool character as well.**** In Response to an earlier post by Phoenix-1 **** To expect any movie to accurately portray history in any way is lunacy. Even those movies that come close to historical accuracy are flawed in many ways. This was a way of telling a story, as any movie is. It can be argued that it tries to provoke curiosity in another culture, but it is also meant to entertain. I would also like to point out that Mulan is really not ""historical,"" like Joan of Arc, but rather she is a legend, much like Hercules and Aladdin, who also come from the realm of myth, stories and legends. And while there is some difference between the original legend and this movie, your examples of how Disney would butcher tales of George Washington and Abraham Lincoln do not compare to this story in any way. Your arguments for comparison should be better applied to Pocahontas, as she was an actual historical figure.",Mulan
1330,Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0452541/,"The `unflimable' novel by Thompson is brought to the screen.  Hunter S. Thompson gets a call to go to Las Vegas to cover a motorcross race.  Using the advance money to purchase a load of drugs he sets out on a road trip with his crazed Samoan lawyer.  However as their trip continues they encounter all manner of insanity and paranoia in their drug fuelled trip into the American dreamNever read the book, never been a big fan of this particular culture and ever felt inclined to read any of this sort of work  however, really enjoyed the movie.  The plot is, well, a trip rather than anything concrete or logical.  There is a message tacked on somewhere near the end but really this is more of an experience than a story.  To me the film mainly succeeded due to Terry Gilliam.  His crazed sense of humour is fed through the whole piece, stopping it being indulgent or pretentious as it could easily have been.Instead it manages to be a drug movie but also be very OTT and very. Gilliam's imagination really made Thompson's trips come to life.  It must be hard to actually put something like that on film and I thought he did very well.  This vision is well supported by a brilliantly pitched performance by Depp.  He is on the very edge of ham with this one but gets it just right  making Thompson funny and exaggerated.  De Toro is as good but is very much playing second fiddle on this one.  An all star list of cameos including Maguire, Barkin, Busey, Ricci, Harmon, Penn (of & Teller), Diaz and Lyle Lovett are all enjoyable and don't detract from the film in the way cameos sometimes can (`oh look it's etc').The film may be very loose and aimless but what did you expect?  Those wanting tightness of plot and a set narrative may be let down (though there is a car chase for the teens!).  However this is well worth a look as it is a funny, very imaginative film that proved a lot of people wrong when they said that it could never be filmed.  Certainly anyone who likes the films of Terry Gilliam will find much of his madness here to enjoy.",Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas
1331,Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0452570/,"For all those of you who decry this movie for being pointless and lacking soul, that was the point! This is an excellent movie, a true adaptation of the book, nothing more and nothing less. It is an unflinching look at the sickening excesses of a consumption based culture of America during the early 1970's, who's vacuous heart resides in Las Vegas, a symbol of greed and debauchery. The pointlessness of the movie is a metaphor for the pointless pursuit of personal gratification and greed, the true heart of the ""American Dream"".If you put aside the usual assumptions about a movie, i.e. that you are supposed to care about the characters, that their needs to conflict and resolution etc, then you will enjoy it much better. This movie is a magical ride and actually works on many levels, not only as testimony to the horrors of excessive drug use, and the tacky, ugly view of the worst parts of America, but also to the failed 60's generation, a generation that thought that ""somebody somewhere is guarding the light at the end of the tunnel"". Drug use is simply a way of escaping your present reality, and all the drugged out zeroes of the sixties were truly lost if they thought that enlightenment and peace could come from a hit of acid. This movie takes Timothy Leary's supposition of ""freeing  your mind"" to it's ultimate conclusion and the conclusion is that you are not actually freeing your mind, but destroying it.Of course this movie is also fun to watch the incredible performances by Johnny Depp and Benitio Del Torro, both of whom I barely even recognized in their roles (Depp with a shaven head and the bloated Del Torro who gained 40 pounds for his portrayal of ""Dr. Gonzo""). Del Torro has one scene in particular (the bathtub scene) which is both disgusting and very disturbing. Apparently his performance was so convincing that he had a hard time getting work after this film because everyone was convinced that he was wasted on the set. The truth is that he's just a damn fine actor who didn't hold back for one second, which is exactly what the film called for. Also the scene of Johnny Depp squealing like a banshee after imbibing some adrenocrome and Del Torro freaking out behind him is unforgettable.The directing itself is fast paced with offseting angles a lot of wide angle lenses. Gilliam has a style which is unmistakable, it's like walking around inside of a Dali painting, everything is distorted and stretched to create a strong sense of surrealism. Yet his approach is much less offensive than Oliver Stone, who desperately throws every single filming trick at you repeatedly until you are pummeled into submission. Wow, look he switch to 8 mm, then black and white, now it's slow mo all in 3 seconds!Anyway, I digress. This is a fine movie, don't watch it stoned, you'll get more out of it, repeated viewings are recommended. I also recommend getting the criterion DVD version, which has commentary by Gilliam, Depp, del Torro and Hunter S. Thompson himself!",Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas

What an amazingly done film! I've never seen such great acting in a German language movie (the film is Austrian - just to be precise); the script is full of surprises and the whole film has a tightness that is very rare; every little detail is in the right place.Michael Haneke always likes to challenge his audience, but even among his more controversial films 'Funny Games' stands out. The story follows the logic of a nightmare; uneasy tension gives way to unreal horror as you stare in disbelief at what's happening on screen.

Before leaving the room, he finds the corpse of a woman and a knife. Soon a group of Strangers hunts him down but he succeeds to escape. Before leaving the hotel, the front desk informs that his wallet is in a restaurant. He retrieves his wallet and learns that his name is John Murdoch (Rufus Sewell) and is married with Emma (Jennifer Connely). He is followed by the persistent police inspector Frank Burnstead (William Hurt) that believes he is a serial- killer. Murdich also learns that he has uncontrolled powers called tuning similar to the Strangers and he flees using the powers. Murdoch notes that the city does not have daylight and every midnight the Strangers rearrange the city and change the people memories. Further, everybody knows the coastal town Shell Beach by heart but nobody knows how to go there. He teams up with Burnstead and Emma and apparently Dr. Schreber is the only human who knows what is happening in the city. What will be the fate of the humans in the hands of the Strangers?""Dark City"" is a timeless cult sci-fi noir that has not aged and uses references from other films that perfectly works. The noir style is a tribute to the period between 1939 and 1950; the ""Strangers"" and the Gothic style are visibly inspired in ""Nosferatu"" and ""Metropolis""; the aliens that take the human bodies are inspired in 'Body Snatchers"". Further, it certainly has influenced ""Matrix"" that was released one year later. The cinematography and special effects are astonishing and the performances are top-notch. Like a wine, this film seems to be better as years go by. Fortunately the writers and director have not been seduced with the success and there is no sequel of this little masterpiece. My vote is nine.Title (Brazil): ""Cidade das Sombras"" (""City of the Darkness"")",Dark City
1334,Sleepers,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2372099/,"This is one of the only films that I can watch time after time and still be highly entertained. The film has many layers and a great cast of fantastic actors. It also has a wealth of superbly drawn minor characters. Bruno Krby is excellent as always as Shakes' dad. A man apparently typical of the community in Hells Kitchen. Proud but ruling his wife in particular with a iron fist. He is portrayed far more favourably than in the book where it is clear he is a lousy father and husband. But it is the ever excellent Kevin Bacon who threatens to steal the show as the deeply disturbing Sean Nokes. He is pivotal to the 4 boys descent in to hell and his evil in the bar scene where he meets his demise sets the wheels in motion for the revenge in the 3rd part of the movie. De Niro is superb as always but has great support in Brad Pitt, Jason Patric, Minnie Driver and Dustin Hoffman. A Must see if you like films of this genre.",N/A
1335,Sleepers,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0973266/,"This movie made a fuss when it came out because there were claims that its author had lied about it being ""based on a true story."" As a result it become a sort of infamous title and people cared less about the film's content and more about its ""accuracies.""Well, frankly I don't really care about whether or not the story is true because I know things similar to this _do_ happen - children are abused and using this as a backbone for a revenge film may seem a bit inappropriate but it is handled with care by director Barry Levinson and the highly talented ensemble cast treat it with caution.Robert De Niro gives a convincing performance as the Catholic priest who is a father-figure to a bunch of disillusioned Brooklyn youth. After they accidentally injure a man during a rebellious incident they are sent away to a juvenile facility where they are sexually and physically abused by the evil warden (Kevin Bacon). Years later two of the boys (now grown men) take revenge on Bacon and kill him in a public area. They are sent to trial but not all is what it seems - representing the case is someone involved with the past and there are some other interesting twists along the way.The abuse isn't really the subject of this movie - instead the ""what if a trial could be rigged?"" question is more prescient. (Think ""Runaway Jury"" meets ""Deliverance."") The cast is fantastic - De Niro, Dustin Hoffman, Brad Pitt, Jason Patric, Minnie Driver, Bacon, et al. It's a movie buff's dream come true! If only Al Pacino had popped up....De Niro has been given a bad reputation lately as a ""sell-out"" - but he provides a really deep and multi-layered performance here. It's too bad people forget about this movie along with some others he made around the turn of the decade because a lot of them were very good. This is one of them.Levinson (""Rain Man,"" ""Diner"") is sometimes a bit too heavy on schmaltz in his films and that's the reason many people (myself NOT included) disliked ""Rain Man."" However here - for the most part - he abandons this and presents the material with a good touch. It's atmospheric and dark - it feels a bit like De Niro's ""A Bronx Tale"" and ""Diner"" colliding together.Overall this is a really good film that is not without its flaws but is still engaging and surprising and underrated - a must-see for any self-respecting film buff.4.5/5",Sleepers
1336,Lost Highway,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1188961/,"Just watched this for the first time, and enjoyed it immensely. Some here have suggested that there's no 'real' story at all. I don't agree: Lynch doesn't work like that - no matter how bizarre and reticulated, there's a story there, all right, but you have to dig for it.'Mulholland Drive' informs this film considerably. Having deconstructed that one to my satisfaction, I have a clearer view of how Lynch does things; how he shows us the elements, the language he uses, and what he leaves out for us to discover. So, then - *SPOILERS*, if I'm right:As with MD, there's a big clue in the first few seconds: Fred is shown in close-up, looking thoroughly wrecked, smoking a cigarette unsteadily. There's a buzzing sound, and light sweeps across his face and the room. *The sound is one you'll become familiar with later, in the jailhouse.* Fred looks up, warily.Major premise: I believe this scene shows Fred, in the last moments of his life, having his last cigarette before they come to take him to the chair. This may, in fact, be the only 'real' scene in the film, with everything else being Fred's distorted recollection, and the rest a psychotic break fantasy he constructs to escape from his grim situation.As the door to his cell opens, Fred rejects the awfulness of reality, and transforms the buzz into the sound of his door intercom, and at this point we go into his personal flashback as the story continues.The acting and dialogue is often stilted and unrealistic in this flashback. What we're seeing is Fred's recollection, which - as he himself says - is not necessarily the way it actually happened. His relationship with Renee is tense and unreal, with lots of suppressed rage. Cleverly, the undercurrents are conveyed mostly by the background sounds - listed in the credits as 'Ominous drones' - and these provide the significance that the dialogue alone would lack.At the party scene several events take place: his suspicions about Renee and the impossibly sleazy - because he's seen through Fred's eyes - lounge-lizard Andy are effectively confirmed (for him). And he meets the 'Mystery Man', a devil-figure who tells Fred ""You invited me (into your home). It is not my custom to go where I'm not wanted"". I suspect that this figure is Fred's attempt to unload his guilt onto someone else: a 'devil who made him do it' - don't you have to invite the devil into your house? Perhaps he's the personification of Fred's insanity, or his jealousy. Or all of the above - all the dark influences in Fred's life and head.As the flashback continues, we see the progression up to the point where he finally does murder Renee, horribly. Again he attempts to reject the reality by showing it all on video, but reality intrudes and a few seconds are shown of him 'really' sitting among the dismembered parts of his wife. His subsequent trial and sentencing are skipped over - they're a blur to Fred - and he winds up on Death Row.Facing execution, and unable to tolerate his real state, Fred then creates a fantasy in which he escapes his fate by miraculously turning into another person - an innocent: young, enjoying a simple life, good at his simple job; with groovy, understanding parents and a pliable girlfriend.The scenes around Fred's miraculous replacement are classic Lynch fantasy-made-real: the dialogue is ludicrous; the events comic-book. We see the same in the fantasy world of the central character in MD.Although safe in this new fantastical environment, Fred/Peter is unable to resist being drawn back into danger, initially via his unlikely relationship with the - again comic-book - gangster boss, Mr. Eddy. This gangster character is a one-dimensional, violent crazy man who recalls the fantasy mafia types invented by the central character in MD to 'explain' her bad break.Even so, Peter's life will remain peaceful if he avoids any dealings with Eddy outside of the grease-monkey relationship. But Fred's paranoia demands danger, and Peter begins an even less plausible and obviously perilous association with Fred's new incarnation of Renee: the pure-hearted damsel in distress that is Alice.Except that, once again, Peter's life is contorted by Fred's paranoia, and Alice slowly metamorphoses into a spiteful, greedy psychotic who leads Peter further into danger. (I looked for the 'Eye of the Duck' peripeteiac scene that Lynch always puts into his films, and one of the candidates is, I think, the moment where Alice points the gun at him after raiding 'Andy's' house. The tableau is held long enough to allow you to contemplate all that could happen if she shoots Peter and takes off. But that's not possible in a Fred/Peter fantasy, so we continue, with the point about her ruthlessness made.)What else? The storyline continues as might be expected, with Alice now in total control. The cabin we've seen before just prior to Fred's metamorphosis. Alice disappears. The Mystery Man returns, and so does Mr. Eddy and Fred. All of this in a fight, during which the devil-figure hands him a knife that allows him to defeat Eddy/Dick Laurent (as we have discovered), and finally everything turns to crap as Fred heads back onto the highway with retribution on his tail. Things look hopeless, and the escape fantasy has brought him back to the point where he came in.And then Fred begins another metamorphosis, which we never see completed, and the film ends. Is this another fantasy escape, or his death in the Chair? I don't know how much of this is correct. Perhaps one day someone will tie Mr. Lynch to a rack, put electrodes on his nuts, and extract the line-by-line details of his wonderful creations. Until then we must wonder and worry. And marvel.",N/A
1337,Sense and Sensibility,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0371071/,"This is a remarkable film that does a very good job of depicting a rigid and quite hidebound society that often made India's caste system look reasonable and moderate by comparison.  One of the more enjoyable points for me was the fact that the ""sense and sensibility"" of the title had a most definite 19th Century feel and yet still remains very timeless and does not attempt to force Twentieth Century mores (probably by use of a crowbar) into a script where they do not belong.  Modern day viewpoints do not belong here.  If you want a modern day version, fine.  But it would be, at best, only a glancing and quite loose adaptation of the novel, so why do an adaptation at all, then?  Not all films have to reflect present day sensibilities.  This is a very human and compelling story with a fine cast and wonderfully witty script.  Look for a very dry and understated performance by Hugh Laurie as Mr. Palmer, the long-suffering husband of the daughter of Mrs. Jennings. Were I Mr. Palmer, I'd have long since invested in earplugs or opened a vein.  Very fine film and most highly recommended.",N/A

Even though I liked Die Harder, it lacked the brains of its predecessor. John McTiernan returned to give us an action flick that not only delivers as an action flick but is also quite effective as a thriller.Simon Peter Gruber(Jeremy Irons) is the brother of Hans Gruber who was killed by McClane in the Nakatomi Plaza. He detonates a few bombs in New York City and sends McClane on ""Fools Errands"" while covering up his real scheme: to steal gold reserves. McClane is saved from an a**kicking by angry mob by Zeus Carver(Samuel L Jackson), a shop owner. They reluctantly team up to play along with Simon's games. They later find out his big scheme all along.Samuel Jackson and Bruce Willis have excellent chemistry together. Plus you have to admire the match up. Zeus Carver has a nationalistic mentality and John McClane is your not-so-average white-bread cop. Despite their differences they still get together to handle the same goal. Zeus despite his prejudices was still a factor in helping McClane solve those riddles which were more clever than the riddles that were given to you by Jim Carrey's Riddler in Batman Forever.Jeremy Irons is magnificent as Simon Peter Gruber. He's definitely one of the best movie villains in history. His plan showed a clever genius absent from movie villains nowadays. Quite possibly the last serious role that Jeremy Irons had. Tell the truth, can you look at him with a straight face after he starred in Dungeons and Dragons? I think not.I like the pacing of this movie too. It keeps you glued to the screen and provides a thrill ride from start to finish. Im kind of surprised That everybody knows that its better than Die Hard 2. Plus this movie has lowest score of all Die Hard movies on Rottentomatoes. Shows you just how much these snooty consensus followers really know. The fact that this movie was outsold by Batman Forever in the box office shows you exactly where the intelligence of the movie-going was heading. Straight down the toilet bowl and they've been sinking further into the sewer since then.If you're looking for an action/thriller that doesn't disappoint you cant go wrong with Die Hard With A Vengeance. It has great acting, a superb villain, a good plot and some engaging action sequences. More effective than what passes for Thriller these days and is easily the most underrated action sequel of all time.",Die Hard With A Vengeance

Their four days together would change their lives forever. The premise doesn't sound too original, but Eastwood wonderfully captures all the raw emotions between these people, who seem throughly genuine, alive, and passionate.

1342,Three Colors: White,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0351548/,"It is not only difficult to comment separately on the three parts of Kieslowski's trilogy, it seems obvious that the filmmaker wants us to do just the opposite:  view them in order, Blue, White, and Red, and consider them together as one complete work.  It is true they are distinct stories with distinct themes: liberty, equality, fraternity, and each them is developed with unique applications of intrigue and artistry.  They are each well worth seeing independently, but I believe they are best seen as one work.  Collectively, I would rate the trilogy as a 9; separately, I place each in my top ten for the years 1993 and 1994.White is the fabric of a bride, chaste and pure at the outset of her marriage; later it is the flash of an orgasm in the dark; and then .... But any more said of the instances of white in this film might spoil it for the first-time viewer.   Unlike Three Colors: Blue, White is a more plot-oriented movie, with two main characters to Blue's one.  And this is as it should be.   Blue's theme of Liberty, the first word of France's motto, is an individual's principle, while White's theme of Equality, the French motto's second word, requires at least two people.  The central quest for liberty is personal; the struggle for equality is fundamentally social. White is the most conventional of the three Color films, and while it is still one of my ten top films of 1994, I rate it an 8, slightly less than the highly visual Blue and the mind-bending Red.",White

WHITE is the glimmer of the impending reflexes in the background of a lazy town buried under the snow. WHITE is the bust of a statue caressed as a memento of a love irremediably lost. WHITE is Dominique's final orgasm, a real scream of liberation from the yoke of her spiteful stubbornness, the false revenge of a woman unaware of her impending calamity, completely unacquainted with the bitter game of make-believe inspired by a wickedness that cries out for vengeance. According to Karol, the main character, it's better to have loved and lost than never to have loved at all. His desire for revenge blows out his residual flickering flame of love after having suffered unforgivable affronts devised by his heartless wife.""Trzy kolory: Bialy"" (Three colors: White), second episode inspired to the three colors of the French flag and to the three principles of the French Revolution (Freedom, Equality and Fraternity), brings back to us two old acquaintances, Zbigniew Zamachowski (very similar to the pathetic Italian character Fantozzi,) and Jerzy Stuhr. It may be considered the most unforeseeable movie of the whole colors trilogy, full of sharp and witty tones of grotesque melodrama, with a reluctant and peevish Julie Delphy never seen so cold-mannered on the screen before. The inborn sense of Kieslovski's BLACK humor comes out here in all its might almost counterbalancing the concept of absolute WHITE connected with he story.""Three colors: white"" is very different from the other two episodes of the trilogy, but nonetheless the unmistakable touch of the genius can be generously found in the accurate care of the details, in the emotional intensity of the dialogs, in the careful analysis of the individual values, in his safe distance from the events represented by him, in his constant application of the principle of casualness and in his large use of metaphors (look for instance at the sequences of simultaneous flights of pigeons, symbolizing an open concept of freedom often cherished in his works). And Julie Delphy's following words sound as a sort of sincere homage to Kieslovski's art: ""Kieslowski is a director who draws his inspiration from the true life of people, who instills his own soul into his movie, who dwells upon the details as if he wanted to examine the life under a microscope.""

I thoroughly enjoyed viewing this again after so many years.
This movie is still relevant today no matter which country u belong to.
Michael Douglas' hypnotic performance is the highlight of this film. Everything about him, from his half sleeve plain white shirt, to his briefcase, his lunch, his specs and his torn shoes all screamed average middle class.
The best line of the film is when Douglas asks Duvall, I am the bad guy?I don't know but I was laughing my guts out while viewing this film. The guy who played the neo Nazi is creepy n hilarious. The cosmetic surgeon's house scene, the golf ground scene, the burger scene n the store scene, I found all these scenes darkly comical.
Douglas' middle class person act is mind blowing. He potrayed the character who has to go thru everyday nuances very well. Working hard still ain't able to purchase a house, non payment of rent, road n traffic issues, employment issues, etc.
The effect of consumerism has on each of us is dealt with properly in this film.
The funny part is that the rich doesn't care about inflation or monetary probs, the poor gets government n ngo's aid while the middle class is stuck between em like a sandwich.
The government doesn't care about him, they care about vote banks and that lies within the poor community.",N/A
1345,Dazed and Confused,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1570261/,"I can see the appeal of this movie. It is very much an ""American Graffiti"" for the '70s. If you look just a little you can find many of the same caricatures used by Lucas. DC is viewed by the youth of today much as we viewed AG in our day. Contrary to many of the other reviewers I saw little humor in the hazing and the wide-spread drinking and smoking weed. That is not to say that there were not funny moments and lines, because there were quite a few; Slater's ""knowledge"" of history particularly hilarious. Who knew that Martha Washington grew weed - apparently by the bushel!I also found it interesting the number of reviewers that have watched this movie and assert that this ""exactly"" their experience during the '70s. Mine was far from it. Growing up in a small N. California town (not far from AG's inspiration - Modesto) much of what was depicted did not occur or at least not to the extreme shown. Parents cared what time their children came home, what they'd been up to and if they'd been drinking/smoking. That is not to say that there wasn't any drinking/smoking - it was just on lower level and not nearly as wide-spread as depicted.And many of the ""pranks"" shown in the movie occurred but were easily remedied in the real world. My father's mail box was hit only once. It's concrete-filled replacement collected broken bats for years afterward. And our equivalent of paddling was promptly discontinued when a freshman stabbed his assaulting senior with a knife. Problem solved.But this is the way with movies. A narrow reality is shown often with few if any consequences for actions. Those not having lived in the time view it and get nostalgic over what they ""missed out on."" In reality the only thing they missed out on was a figment of someone's imagination. One thing particularly note worthy of this movie is the quality of acting. I don't think that there was a bad performance in the lot. Perhaps some could have been better but none were bad. And others have noted, the music selections were great. Now there is a reality that is sorely missed today - the great wealth of artistic talent that was the '70s.

If you want to know what being in High School in the mid 70's was like, rent this film. I grew up in the metro Manhattan area. We didn't have the freshman hazing, and few of us could afford the cars (although we sure knew about them and lusted after them), but the rest of this movie is so dead on about my experience of High School in the 70's that it's scary. Every character in the film corresponds with someone that I knew during that time. Yes, there was a lot of pot smoking, yes, obtaining beer was quite easy for underage kids...I used to buy it in bars when I was 16. We made pipes in shop class. We hung out and had parties at night, drove the streets drinking beers and smoking joints listening to the same music. There were no youth centers though. The girls that I knew were as beautiful, and also struggled to get into their jeans. They used pliers too, but they also put them on while they were wet to further get that skintight look. There was no HIV virus to worry about, Herpes was not a big thing then, the biggest worry was getting pregnant. Everyone was having sex... All of these facts also were no big deal. Most of my peers grew up just fine, and now are upstanding pillars of the community. Many today would like you to believe that this is an example of the road to ruin. It was an incredible great time. The film has interesting character development, with the same types I remember. Philosophers, heads (now called stoners), bullies and waifs. This is my American Graffiti and it is perfect. Waxing nostalgic? Perhaps, but anyone that didn't live through that time will sill love the dialog in this film, as it deals with the universal experience of that point in one's life. This is high school in the 70's. Check it out.",N/A
1347,My Cousin Vinny,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0310522/,"MY COUSIN VINNY is just one of those ""feel good"" movies delivering some grins that won't wash away. An excellent cast includes Joe Pesci in one of his best roles as a hotshot lawyer. Expect a few unbelievable surprises from the irresistible guy who's smart enough to make one hilarious movie after another. He is downright likeable, and so is Marisa Tomei, a sassy and stylish figurine who was amazingly superb to take home the Best Actress Oscar. Both Pesci and Tomei have the colorful wits and personalities to make a wild pair for themselves (almost like living in the 50s for sure!). Also, the movie's best moment arises when a freight train disturbs Pesci's sleep at five in the morning. The deep downside is the latter portion: a climatic courtroom scene that, while up to the point of interest, runs terribly long and weak....until one of the film's cast members gets into the act! Still, it's worth plenty of good gags and good laughs that aren't so bugging. Pesci would look terrific in a torn-up leather jacket in front of the judge, to his ultimate disgrace! Smart comedy is smart thinking after all.",My Cousin Vinny
1348,My Cousin Vinny,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1174406/,"My Cousin Vinny is one of the most brilliant comedies ever produced. There is simply so much to love about this movie.First, this is not simply a slapstick comedy. Sure, there is some of that, including a few hilarious moments in the Alabama mud. But the dialogue in this film is terrifically funny. The writers were able to turn a courtroom script into an incredibly funny exchange of dialogue between lawyers, judges and witnesses. And the whole idea of an out-of-work hairdresser knowing about Positraction is simply brilliant.This dialogue is brilliant because of excellent performances by both Marisa Tomei and Joe Pesci. These two sell this whole load of nonsense so beautifully it should be mandatory viewing for first-year drama students. These two actors show how talented people can read practically anything and make it not only funny but wholly believable.Even all the side characters, from the judge to the D.A. to the defendants to the jury and witnesses are brilliantly played. Some of the exchanges between a local Alabama judge and a NYC poser lawyer would be completely ridiculous in anyone else's hands, but these people make it so real and so funny it's truly a thing of beauty.This is one of those rare films that I can watch over and over again for hours and not tire of it.10 out of 10 Barky",My Cousin Vinny
1349,Only Yesterday,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0297598/,"This is probably my favorite animated film of all -- and now it looks even more beautiful than ever (thanks to the Japnese DVD release).  This is a story of a 20-something ""office lady"" who is vaguely dissatisfied with what she sees as increasingly pointless life in the big city. As she visits the rural family of her sister's husband for a working vacation, she also revisits her fifth grade self. (The contemporary scenes are done in a fairly realistic fashion, the flashbacks have a lovely pastel look -- that would later be used even more extensively in ""Our Neighbors, the Yamadas""). This film does not draw upon cartoons for its background, but on the films of Ozu and Naruse. The intelligence and sublety of the characterization is extraordinary. This also has a very appealing use of Hungarian folk music (the favored music of our heroine's young farmer friend). If you've never before sobbed tears of joy over closing credits before, you will here. (It never fails for me -- at about 7 times and counting). While Takahata's ""Grave of the Fireflies"" may have a more timely (and harrowing) tale to tell, I think this understated little story is even more beautiful and effective.",Only Yesterday

At first Culkin loves the situation, but soon he is scared to death when he learns that burglars Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern are targeting his house.  However, Culkin is pretty smart for an eight-year-old and he has plans for them when they attack.  Chris Columbus' direction is smart and so is the over-achieving screenplay.  This film has a little bit of something for everyone and the fact that the backdrop is the Christmas holidays, only makes it that much more special.  All the performers do well and in the end the film also does.  4 stars out of 5.",Home Alone
1351,Home Alone,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0283525/,"Oh, come on, IMDb users. How could this film get only a 6.5? Yes, it's a kid's movie, but I know plenty of adults(not including myself) who loved this film. It touches our hearts, and tickles our funny bones. Not to mention I think in one way or another we could relate to it. That's why it remains a classic Christmas comedy.Home Alone is not only one of the highest box office successes of all time, but it deserves more praise. Mac showed a talent that very little child stars have now-a-days. He brought in a great comedy about a boy who accidentally is left home alone when his family goes on vacation and takes on two burglars.Yeah, it's quit unrealistic about the burglars, but honestly, this is a terrific family film. Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern are the perfect comedy duo of two idiots who can't rob the place because a 8 year old child has out witted them and set some clever and very funny traps around the house.Please give this movie a chance, it's just terrific and I guarantee nothing but great laughs for you and the whole family.10/10",Home Alone

Al Pacino performs brilliantly and I enjoyed Joe Mantegna in his roll. Definitely worth the watch if you were a fan of the previous 2 films.",N/A

After seeing it the first time I thought it was good, but I have to say that I liked it even more on my second viewing. The film is absolutely wonderful! The story is very amusing and keeps you interested in the characters from start to finish.I literally couldn't wait to see what would happen in the next scene. This is one of those movies that goes by very quickly. I think that's a sign of a good movie, when you just can't believe that you're already an hour or so into the movie. The story really flows nicely from scene to scene.The cast is great in the film as well. Billy Crystal pulls off one of his best performances, and has a slew of great jokes throughout the film. Meg Ryan looks as beautiful as ever and has such a cute way about her. Bruno Kirby and Carrie Fisher definitely deserve a great deal of credit too, they both did superb jobs as well. Director Rob Reiner did a great job with the film, keep up the good work Rob.If you're into romantic comedies, then you definitely should see this film. Even if you aren't really into the whole romantic part of it, the comedy is great and worth seeing. I would most definitely recommend seeing this film.I hope you like it.

1354,The Little Mermaid,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0272435/,"I was definitely no kid when I saw ""The Little Mermaid""; in fact, I was 20. I was thoroughly captivated by this movie - one of the last real delights from Disney's regular animation crews (before they had to get help from Pixar and Tim Burton) - and the Mouse couldn't have wished for a better movie to get them back on the proper road, animation-wise. (Of course, after this, ""Aladdin"" and ""Beauty and the Beast"" they've slipped a bit - though they're still better than DreamWorks.)Though not exactly loyal to the original story - Hans Christian Andersen was much more keen on unhappy endings - it's doubtful it would have worked as well if it had. The movie has just about everything going for it... lush animation, spirited musical numbers (this started Alan Menken's run of success for Disney, and he's surely had enough time to refresh himself by now, and for us all to forget ""Pocahontas""), wonderfully evil villain, likeable supporting players, and my all-time favourite Disney heroine, the endearing and lovely Ariel (remember the episode of ""Cheers"" when Norm said he fancied her? She got a lot of real life guys' hearts - beat that, Princess Fiona from ""Shrek"").And as a plus, the subsequent TV series (set before the movie) even managed to capture some of the spirit of the movie. But go for the original... a classic.",The Little Mermaid

1357,"Planes, Trains & Automobiles",https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3653395/,"To me, Planes, Trains and Automobiles is John Hughes's third best movie (next to Ferris Bueller's Day-Off and The Breakfast Club) and it's also the best movie of both Steve Martin and John Candy. It's a funny story about an uptight businessman called Neil Page who is trying to get home to his family for Thanksgiving. But along the way he gets stuck with a good-natured but annoying blabbermouth screw-up named Del Griffith. The two of them go on a really rough trip home (most of it is Del Griffith's fault), especially Neil. But I like how Neil can't stand Del after all the trouble he got him into but in the end Neil learns to appreciate Del and considers him his friend and even invites him to spend Thanksgiving at his house. As well as being a great comedy, there are also some dramatic moments. Like when in the motel room where Neil rants about how annoying Del is and how he talks too much but Del responds with his touching ""You wanna hurt me..."" speech and that he likes who he is. And it's also surprising at the end when Neil learns that Del is homeless and his wife has been dead for years. It's also sad to know that John Candy (1950-1994) and John Hughes (1950-2009) are both dead because they were both legends of their time. But the funny movies that they made like Uncle Buck, Home Alone and of course, Planes, Trains and Automobiles will remain classics for years to come.","Planes, Trains and Automobiles"
1358,"Planes, Trains & Automobiles",https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0248399/,"John Candy was a comic genius. He really was. Never was his talent on display better than it was in this film. John Hughes and John Candy went on to develop what I can only surmise was quite the friendship because Candy appeared in many Hughes films either as the star ( this one, Uncle Buck, Great Outdoors ) or with a cameo ( Home Alone, Vacation and a few others that I can't think of right now, but check the IMDb and you'll see that he did ). But of all the films that Candy did, including Stripes, I don't think he has ever been as good and as funny as he was in here. If there was any justice in the Academy ( and we all know that is an oxymoron, Academy and justice ) then Candy would have at least been nominated for best actor in 1987. I think Douglas won that year for Wall Street and he deserved to but Candy was brilliant in this film. It was a shame to see his career cut short because even in his bad films he was good. This is his best and most complete role. He will be missed but at least we have great roles like this to remember him by.Planes.... is a film about one man trying to get home for the American Thanksgiving. He is Neil Page and he is played with perfect smugness by Steve Martin. He is a work-a-holic and his lifestyle is that of many John Hughes family men that live in suburbia Chicago. He lives in a huge house, much like the one in Home Alone and Weird Science, and his family is a beautiful one that consists of a lovely wife and three kids. But he is never home and for all of his success professionally, it is the kind of family that although is together now, it may not survive the fast approaching 90's if Neil Page continues his ways.John Candy plays Dell Griffith. He is a jolly man, much like Santa Clause but without the beard and the old age. This is a man that carries a giant trunk around with him and is a constant chatter box. He is the kind of man that you know is good at sales, but on a lower level. He is too much of a slob to really be a corporate sales guy. Of course this Laurel and Hardy pair cross paths and from here on out Neil's simple task of getting home to his family for Thanksgiving is going to be a journey from hell.First of all he loses his cab in New York rush hour to Candy who unwittingly steals it from him, then he is bumped from first class and ends up sitting next to Candy on the plane. Then they are delayed because of weather problems and what do you know, they end up spending the night together in not only the same hotel, not only the same room but the same bed. This presents all sorts of comic possibilities and Hughes doesn't miss one of them. His comic timing and development of the two characters is brilliant. Some of the best scenes are when the two are bantering and Candy is verbally assaulted by Martin. Martin goes off and says that he is annoying to listen to and then he says this: "" You know I could sit through an insurance seminar and still look happy and the others would say how do you do it? And I would say, because I can take anything, I've been with Dell Griffith, and they'd say, "" I know what you mean. Whooooo, shower curtain guy! "" And as funny as that scene is, Hughes goes for more than the quick payoff of laughter. He then reminds you that this isn't just a comedy but a film with many layers and substance to it. Because the next scene has Candy delivering a monologue that almost makes you embarrassed for laughing at what Martin said.But truth be told, first and foremost, this is a funny, funny film. And if anyone has scene it, they will tell you about the airport scene where Page has lost his rental car and he comes back and does what we have all dreamed of doing ourselves, he goes ballistic on the person behind the desk, who subsequently is Grace, from Ferris Bueller's Day Off. She must have been fired by Ed Rooney and now rents cars at airports for a living. She plays a desk clerk that has decided to take the Thanksgiving holiday a little sooner that she is supposed to. Martin comes in and she starts by saying, ""Can I help you?"" Martin replies, ""You can start by wiping that f***ing dumbass smile off your rosy f@**ing cheeks. "" From there he goes into an F-Word filled tirade about how her company left him in the middle of f***ing nowhere with f****ing keys to a f***ing car that isn't f***ing there. It is one of the funniest moments that I have seen in any film because you don't expect it from a Hughes film.Planes... is a heart warming film about family, friendship and good will towards men. It is also a wickedly funny movie and it will stand the test of time and I think in 30 or 40 years from now, it may be looked upon as Hughes best film. Candy and Martin are wonderful in here and it is really a treat to watch them work together.10 out of 10","Planes, Trains and Automobiles"
1359,Lethal Weapon,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4460300/,"If you have to see an action movie or buddy cop movie from the 80s, and you've already seen ""Die Hard"", then you absolutely must see ""Lethal Weapon"". It's one of my all-time favorites, if not my absolute favorite, and everything about is so watchable and memorable, and it never gets old no matter how many times you watch it. An absolute classic. The film was so influential that it spawned a whole host of copycats, such as ""Red Heat"", ""Tango & Cash"", ""The Glimmer Man"", ""Bad Boys"" its sequels, and others.You already know the plot: Two very different cops (Mel Gibson, Danny Glover) are assigned to work with each other, to take down some drug dealers. Matters are complicated however, when they kidnap one cop's daughter.This movie was perfect, especially for its time period, it still holds up today. The characters are still engaging, everyone delivers wonderful performances, there are great action sequences, and this movie is pretty much the epitome of character development. Amid the bullets and fighting, you get to see two very different characters, who are both in a way, the same character. Both cops have been on the force for a while, both have seen action, both are getting tired and looking for a way out. Both are good cops and people, but Murtaugh is tired of putting his life on the line, which is all Riggs knows how to do. Riggs and Murtaugh are two sides of the same coin, and they are one of the best on-screen duos ever to be seen. BothGibson's character, Martin Riggs, really brings most of the action, and when he's not dodging bullets or beating the crap out of someone, he's joking around and being cocky. Glover's character, Roger Murtaugh, is a skilled cop, but one who's tired of being a cop. Riggs is just tired of living. The two become embroiled in a drug investigation, and the pair engage in many antics along the way, such as a shootout at a Christmas tree lot, a death-defying jump off of a building, an intense chase along Hollywood Boulevard, and one final, brutal, legendary final fight scene that really compliments the tone of the whole film, and it really expresses the intensity and craziness of Riggs.Many refer to this as an action comedy, which is fair, but it really is more generous to the action genre than the comedy genre. There are some comedic moments, but this, and the second film are definitely more action-thriller oriented than comedy-oriented, but 3 and 4 are much more lighthearted. This film barely scrapes by as an action comedy, which is one of the things that makes it so good. It's just really brutally action-packed, probably as much as ""Die Hard"", but not to the point where it's over the top. Probably the perfect mix of action and storytelling, honestly. There were many memorable action scenes, such as the Christmas tree lot shootout, desert shootout, torture fight, club shootout and foot chase, and the final fight. In between those are many other brief instances of action and violence.Shane Black, a truly gifted script writer, has written some excellent films, and this is definitely one of, if not his actual, best. He establishes a really cool, dark, and gritty mood, and it compliments the character of Riggs so well. The film is really about two different, flawed characters who try to do the right thing, and succeed, learning about and accepting each other in the process. I should also note that Gary Busey delivers a pretty great performance as a villain, and he and Jet Li were probably the best of the four villains from the franchise.Richard Donner also delivers incredibly with the action sequences, adeptly staging and pacing the scenes, and swiftly moving us from one nail-biting scene to the next, while also using the lead actors' talents to the fullest, and Donner also handles the dramatic scenes quite well here, proving that he can capably handle just about any scenario he has to direct.Overall, I HIGHLY recommend this film, and except for a few brief instances of unnecessary nudity, and a lot of strong language, this film is just too good not to watch, and you owe it to yourself to give it a shot, at least once.",Lethal Weapon

Mel Gibson plays a crazed cop who teams up with a family cop (Danny Glover). At first, they can't stand each other, but as the movie rolls along, they end up with this type of bond. I'm sure that most people or everyone has seen this wonderful movie. It has plenty of action and violence. I love the chemistry between Mel Gibson and Danny Glover. And who could forget, Gary Busey, Mr. Joshua, a VERY fitting role for the wonderful actor. He couldn't have been replaced for that role. No one could have done a better job than Busey. Go Gary! I love the end! One of the best fitting scenes in film history. I also admire Gibson and Busey doing their own stunts, and studying martial arts, just to make 4 nights of filming a cult fighting scene for this excellent movie. This one is definitely a winner!

1361,On Golden Pond,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0188024/,"On Golden Pond is a film that proved to me that acting is a beautiful thing when it comes from some of the veterans and the greats.  I have always had the opinion that most acting from the 60's and earlier is one dimensional and flat.  But then I saw this film and I realized that I was watching two of the best, from any era.  Fonda and Hepburn are absolutely stunning in here and they so richly deserved to win their Oscars that year.  And not only am I mad to see that Chariots of Fire beat out Raiders of the Lost Ark, but it also beat this film out as best picture, and that is a shame, and a crime.On Golden Pond reminded me a little of my relationship with my grandfather. It's not that we didn't get along because we did, but at times it was a little strained simply because of the age difference.  But Billy soon learns that Norman Thayer Jr. is not just an old man, but he is a guy that has a lot say and he can offer him so much and of course they become friends.  So we all know how the movie is going to end up, but it is the execution that is the strength of the film.  We watch as these two grow together.  We sense that they are becoming more at ease with each other and when we finally see our two guys catch that guarantuan fish named Walter, by this time we are pretty much sure what they are going to do.  And it's kind of funny to draw parallels between Walter the fish, and Norman the crusty old man.  But both have been around the pond for years.  Norman's life wouldn't be the same if his quest for the fish was never there.  Perhaps the same with Walter, perhaps he has enjoyed alluding Norman for all these years.  But now the game is up, but it doesn't have to be.  Norman caught him, perhaps that's all that should matter.  You can draw your own conclusions from that analogy.  But I like the way it comes out.On Golden Pond is a treasure.  It is sweet, tender and honest.  You will never see a performance better than the one Henry Fonda gives in this one. And this made me want to go out and rent some of the films that the two screen legends were in before and I have to admit that their early work is impressive.  But it is here that they shine like never before.  So my recommendation is this.  If you are young and would never imagine seeing a film like this because it doesn't have someone like Sara Michelle Gellar or Arnold Schwartzenegger in it, then take the take advice of someone who had the same pre-conceived notions when I was 15.  No Sly, no Spielberg?  Hey forget it, not my cup of tea.  But this will give you a new appreciation of film.  It really is that good.And for those of you that have seen it, remember this line? ""Wife's name is Ethel Thayer, thounds like I'm lithsping dothsn't it? ""  What a great film.",On Golden Pond
1362,The Warriors,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5259960/,"Explaining what makes ""The Warriors"" a good movie and one that is so enjoyable to watch is simple. It's the style.The style announces itself loudly in the opening scene/credit sequence. Each credit appears in the custom text style then recedes into the depth of the screen like a departing train disappearing down a tunnel. Characters engage in excited exchanges about a deity-like leader, Cyrus, who commands the city's most powerful gang, the Grammercy Riffs.Everyone is heading to see him deliver a speech. And, boy, what a speech it is. He captivates the crowd of thousands by using his striking charisma and booming baritone.Then the gathering is abruptly interrupted by an act of violence for which the Warriors are falsely blamed. Acting on this inaccurate information, all gangs seek to capture and/or kill the Warriors. Now the Warriors must brave the dangerous streets on a 28-mile journey to safety.Queue the action sequences. We see a lot of fights and running. A LOT of running. It's all delightful and stylish.Director Walter Hill boldly leaves his fingerprints everywhere, shaping the aesthetic and creating something unusually special.He creates a world of gang warfare that has undertones steeped in reality, but none of the characters of the world they inhabit ever feel real. The movie much more closely resembles a comic book. At times this is played subtly, and in other scenes Hill makes this readily apparent by pausing certain frames on screen to make them look like boxes from a comic book.Dialogue continues the comic book theme. Characters say strange things that no one in real life would ever utter. The camera even moves in an unnatural manner. The action sequences contain exquisite energy, yet they feel completely rehearsed. Viewers are constantly fed reminders that they are watching a movie. It's never meant to be a realistic experience.None of that is to say that this movie isn't enjoyable or that it is poorly made. It's purely a stylistic choice that Hill makes, and it's an overtly intentional one.Within the first few minutes, you will have a pretty good sense if this movie is for you. If you like the vibe early, you'll enjoy the movie. At the very least, this one is worth a shot.",The Warriors

There is wild cheering... And suddenly, out of no where, a mean, small-minded person pulls his gun and shoots to kill... The cowardly little guy of the Rogues quickly yells out that is was Cleon (Dorsey Wright), the Warriors' chief, who killed the legendary leader...In the confusion, and while the police crowds into the park and the congregated gangs flee, Cleon 'get busted' by those who think he murdered Cyrus...Without their leader, the Warriors 'got to stick together, and fight-to-survive.' They attempt to make the long hazardous journey to Coney Island hunted by every gang and cop...Swan (Michael Beck), the cool headed 'war chief,' assumes command... Of his followers only Ajax (James Remar) gives him trouble...Their perilous journey home is filled with considerable amount of risks as they face violent encounters with different gangs in many shapes and colors...'The Warriors' is a film that will make most viewers cringe at times, but you'll forgive the shortcomings and praise the exciting camera-work, the excellent use of music, and the good performance of David Patrick Kelly, the best soft-spoken killer since Andy Robinson in ""Dirty Harry.""

I'm a great fan of puns, and this movie has them quite well placed, but one of the amazing aspects of it is its pacing: it's not really high-speed children's pacing where the filmmakers just randomly decide to move the story along without giving the character's depth, it's just kind of moves along with the characters wherever they want to go.Kermit the Frog is just an awesome character. His voice and the expressions on his puppet-face are fantastic. But above all, he points out why he's popular--""he can sing and make jokes too!""--but more appropriately why he's so endearing--he, without any effort, inspires everyone to search for their dreams. In the meantime, he also has to deal with himself, which is an uncommon theme in family movies.It also contains quite an ensemble of comedians making appearances here and there, some to great effect, others to a little less (I think Mel Brook's part was just a bit overplayed, do you?). Some parts of the film are just kind of odd. But it's highly imaginative and takes itself to the same destination from a very different direction.Moving right along...--PolarisDiB",The Muppet Movie
1365,The Muppet Movie,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0169547/,"In many ways, the perfect movie. The ""Incredible Journey"" and Horatio Alger tale come together for a positive spin on the usually depressing subject of existentialism. In essence, the travails of the muppets boil down to the finale song of the movie: ""Life's like a movie, write your own ending, keep believing, keep pretending."" They create their own reality, which has all the trappings of every epic tale: a lofty goal at the end of what is necessarily a obstacle-laden journey; an ever-increasing group of like-minded individuals for camaraderie; a nasty set of villians who are not beyond all redemption; and a big-budget Hollywood ending because, darn it all, they CAN.Only Jim Henson could pull this off. He walks the line between sentimentality and philosophy without swerving too long or too hard into either. Of course it seems odd that invest such weight into a film starring puppets, but in the end perhaps they are the perfect, uh, puppet to make these points. The movie's atmosphere allows for the pure enjoyment of the Hollywood dream, the ""happy"" ending, unnecessary cameos, and bursting into song at the drop of a hat. Usually these aspects are anathema to quality in film, but the self-deprecating manner under which the story is delivered makes for guilt-free viewing. One of the few films that can truly be called ""suitable for all ages.""The other muppet-related films (including ""The Empire Strikes Back""), while palatable, do not touch the simple grace of this film. Take, for instance, the musical number ""Hope that Something Better Comes Along,"" the duet of Kermit and Rowlf. Amusing in its vaudevillian goofiness, yet makes a bitingly crucial point about the motivations behind life choices. Brilliant.",The Muppet Movie
1366,Escape from Alcatraz,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3468916/,"Escape from Alcatraz is a 1979 film starring Clint Eastwood, Patrick McGooghan, Roberts Blossom, and Paul Benjamin.Eastwood is Frank Morris, who, with the two Anglin brothers (their names were changed for the film) contrived the most elaborate scheme ever to escape ""The Rock."" Their bodies were never found, and a photo surfaced some years later of the brothers in Brazil. The escape, plus Alcatraz's bad reputation, helped it close less than a year later.The movie gives a good idea of the horrors of prison life, and particularly the horrors of Alcatraz. Frankly, I don't think the escapees cared if they died. I'm sure anything was better than being in Alcatraz. Escape from Alcatraz is old-fashioned in that it has the art of the buildup, something lost in today's scripts. Today you must get to the point of your story in the first ten minutes. A film, for instance, like San Francisco where the earthquake happens toward the end would be a no-no. So we see the preparations, and they're impressive - papier mache heads with hair stolen from the barber shop to fool the guards into thinking they were asleep, digging out a grill at the back of the cell and putting a false grill up to fool the guards; welding a digging tool together with silver from a dime; the making of a raft; playing music while digging to hide the noise (though this really isn't shown). It was painstaking.Patrick McGoohan plays the warden, who, like all film prison wardens, is a horror show. When he sees a portrait of himself in a cell, he takes away the painting privileges of one of the inmates, Doc. When he finds out two inmates are talking cell to cell, he demands that they be separated. Actually, at the time of the escape, the warden was Olin Blackwell, considered the most lenient warden Alcatraz had ever had. And by then, inmates were performing music (shown in the film), and had weekend movies (also shown).Clint Eastwood, heavier than we've seen him in years, does an excellent job as Frank Morris, low-key but lethal. There isn't a tremendous amount of dialogue, but with his great presence and Frank's quiet leadership, we really don't need it.Recommended for a gritty look at life on Alcatraz, and the fascinating escape.",Escape from Alcatraz
1367,Escape from Alcatraz,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0960425/,"Some people complain that this movie is ""boring."" It's true it is very quiet and low-key, but this isn't necessarily a bad thing. It has a distinct realistic feel to it, and it manages to be extremely suspenseful without using over-the-top action or an overblown soundtrack. There were several moments that actually had me on the edge of my seat.Fans of Eastwood and McGoohan, who both give fantastic performances, should love this. Fans of prison movies should love this. Fans of suspense movies in general should love this. It is a top-notch movie with good performances all around, and I'd highly recommend it.10/10 stars. Pure, solid entertainment.",N/A
1368,Watership Down,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1468224/,"British animated film about a bunch of rabbits leaving their old warren (which one psychic rabbit can tell is going to be destroyed) and searching for a new one. The movie recounts their adventures searching for one.It may sound like a movie ideal for little kids--but it really isn't. It's an excellent adaptation of Richard Adams book which was written more for teenagers and adults. It's an ecological tale of how men are destroying the earth and (inadvertently it seems) killing innocent wildlife. It's also a very interesting story about how a group of rabbits survive on their own.The animation is excellent--right up there with Walt Disney. The score is great, the script intelligent and the voices used perfectly match the characters. However, as I said, this isn't really for little kids. The story is dead serious and the only humor is provided by the bird Kehaar (who I personally found very annoying although Zero Mostel DOES have fun with the voice). Also, at the end, it gets very violent and quite bloody. When I saw it in a theatre in 1978 one small kid was in tears by the conclusion. So, use your own judgment but I would never let a small kid see this. This is perfect for teenagers and adults. A 10.",Watership Down
1369,Midnight Express,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2175891/,"Wow. This was disturbing. I live in Nottingham, I have many Turkish friends who study here. If I didn't know them, I'd probably think that there wasn't a single Turk who is nice and pleasant... Some parts were actually funny. The judge (in Billy's hate monologue scene) was sounding exactly like Jabba the Hutt! I've heard people speak Turkish around me, so I knew the language which was supposed to be Turkish in the movie, wasn't. Come on people... Feels like this movie was made to make Turks look bad in every way possible. I've read an interview and I learnt that the real Billy Hayes was truly disappointed with the portrayal of Turkish people in the film. Anyway, this movie was fun to watch but would be ignorant to believe. Have a good one",N/A
1370,Midnight Express,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1600135/,"This movie claims to be based on a true story but just like many other Hollywood productions, it warps the truth to an unrecognizable mess. If you want to hear the real story behind the movie, you should see the interview with the real ""Billy Hayes"" on YouTube at:http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TweU77cDrgEhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NqPMI6BnINI&mode=related&searchThe real ""Billy Hayes"" even says that he'd like to go back to Turkey to visit Istanbul. Now that's a slap on the face of the producers of the movie who have demonized all Turks for their personal gain of a statue. They would have received more Oscars if they portrayed the events in realistic terms as ""Billy"" explains in the interview.In my opinion, the story of how the real ""Billy"" made it to the border after he ran away from the prison, would make a wonderful action/adventure movie. Of course, that's where the movie ends, having achieved its purpose of slandering a complete nation. Down with Hollywood!! Long live YouTube for giving a voice to the suppressed truth!",N/A
1371,Close Encounters of the Third Kind,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0152429/,"When the whole area suffers a full blackout, electrician Roy Neary is called out to service some poles suspected of being down.  Sitting in his truck trying to find directions he is suddenly caught in a bright light and the electric's on his truck fail.  Shortly it passes and he sees a craft pass overhead.  At the same time nearby a woman pursues her young son who has wandered out in search of the lights that have been calling to him.  Both adults are left wanting to know the truth and filled with half-ideas and images that haunt them  when Gillian Guiler son is taken, this becomes even more important to them.  Meanwhile the military, led by investigator Claude Lacombe uncover planes and ships that have been missing for decades and uncover hidden codes and signals in the mysterious crafts.I am currently ploughing my way through Speilberg's Taken on BBC2 so I thought I'd give this classic another view just to remind myself how good Speilberg and aliens can be.  The plot is perfect for any UFO nut  the government are behind everything and know of everything.  The story unfolds really well  the three main stories complimenting each other and giving the film a sense of pace.  The strand with Lacombe following events all round the globe is the least personal (and thus least involving) but it is enticing us for the climax of the film.  Neary's soul searching maybe does go on a little too long but the emotion in the family situation is intense and his frustration and sense of confusion is very real.  Although the thrid strand has less screen time the abduction of the child is a powerful scene and the emotion is well brought out.The special effects are very good but the glue of the film is the emotional telling.  This is Speilberg doing well  he never really gives into his American Apple Pie style sentimentality and the film keeps moving along and has a real emotional heart to it.  The climax of the movie always sort of messes me up and I find it best not to question it's logic on any level for fear of holes opening up all over it  but it does have a sense of childlike wonder to it, which I guess Speilberg was trying to get across.As usual Dreyfuss does well under Speilberg and he is mostly responsible for keeping the emotion in his character realistic without being all syrupy and sickly.  Truffaut is OK but it's impossible to see him as anyone but Francis Truffaut and his character suffers as a result.  Garr and Dillon are both strong female characters for different reasons and the support cast are generally very good (including a good handful of the Dreyfuss family).Overall this film never gets me as one of the greatest sci-fi's of all time, but it is certainly a very good film that takes `real' people as it's driver and not flashy effect shots.  That `Taken' seems to be slipping into Norman Rockwell type mawkishness is good enough reason to revisit CE3K.",Close Encounters of the Third Kind
1372,Close Encounters of the Third Kind,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0152472/,"An amazing film, one of my favorites. I watch this regularly, especially at times when the reality of life is overwhelming, just to refocus and regain some sense of perspective.Everything in this film works toward one end: to transform the adult sense of fear back into the childlike sense of wonder at the world. From the very opening moments of the film, designed to create confusion and startlement, this movie creates a sensation of dread and foreboding. The dissonance of the soundtrack, the juxtaposition of images, they all are working to build into the viewer a feeling that something just isn't right, that something out of the ordinary is taking place, and underscoring this all with a sense that this is something to resist, to pull away from, to not allow it to affect one's ""ordinary life."" But as the movie progresses, the tone begins to shift, and the true intent of the film begins to peek through. This isn't about being afraid of the unknown, but rather embracing it. Paying attention to the ""subliminal images"" in life, allowing them to lead you into something unknown and perhaps dangerous, only then can one be open to wonder and experience the world through the magical eyes of a child.Dreyfuss' character takes us on this journey, met with resistance all along the way. His wife, his neighbors, his job, his community, all are working against him, and it's only when he's reached his craziest that he truly gives in and begins to stop trying to understand and instead embraces the experiences in store for him. The scientific community is seeking to understand, but without having any personal calling to be involved. Only Barry is truly able to throw himself into the strangeness that is taking place, and his enthusiasm is greeted by both the characters and the audience as somehow alien and threatening.The ending of this film, when all the fear is finally stripped away and the sense of amazed wonder overtakes everyone on the screen and in the audience, brings about an amazing catharsis. Discarding all the ""adult"" sensibilities and being able to approach life once again with a sense of innocent amazement for the Strange hidden amongst the Ordinary, one can begin again to approach life from a fresh vantage point. Powerful, mystifying, and rejuvenating. I highly recommend this film for anyone jaded with life and seeking a sense of renewal.",N/A
1373,The Long Goodbye,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2200243/,"I really don't understand why this film gets such high ratings. It doesn't work either as an adaptation of a Chandler novel or on its own merits.I'm a big Chandler fan. I understand that adapting a book to film means making concessions, but I don't think there is a single line of dialogue from the book in this film. If you like Chandler then you know it's his dialog that makes him such an outstanding writer and more than just a pulp-fiction hack.I can also understand changing the plot, but this movie removes so much of the original and changes not only the storyline, but the characters and motivations that it becomes incoherent. I mean why make Mexican gangsters in the book into Jewish ones in the film? It takes away from the reasoning of Lennox's flight to Mexico. There is never any real understanding of why or how Lennox and Marlowe met or became friends. There are a whole group of characters left out which gave meaning to story. Without any understanding of the characters, the plot doesn't make sense, and the changes take away from the understanding and make the motivations weak.Although the story was ""updated"" to the 1970's, the look and feel is more of an early 1960's film. It wasn't avant-garde, but already outdated when it came out.Some people like the soundtrack, but I find the one song, in it's numerous variations very insipid. Hearing each version over and over again only point out how awful a song it is. It comes off as a cheap trick.So even on its own terms this movie is very weak and frustrating and as Chandler film it will make aficionados cringe.",N/A
1374,The Long Goodbye,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1642544/,"I admit, when I first viewed ""The Long Goodbye"", in 1973, I didn't like the film; the signature Altman touches (rambling storyline, cartoonish characters, dialog that fades in and out) seemed ill-suited to a hard-boiled detective movie, and Elliott Gould as Philip Marlowe? No WAY! Bogie had been perfect, Dick Powell, nearly as good, but ""M.A.S.H.'s"" 'Trapper John'? Too ethnic, too 'hip', too 'Altman'! Well, seeing it again, nearly 34 years later, I now realize I was totally wrong! The film is brilliant, a carefully-crafted color Noir, with Gould truly remarkable as a man of morals in a period (the 1970s) lacking morality. Perhaps it isn't Raymond Chandler, but I don't think he'd have minded Altman's 'spin', at all! In the first sequence of the film, Marlowe's cat wakes him to be fed; out of cat food, the detective drives to an all-night grocery, only to discover the cat's favorite brand is out of stock, so he attempts to fool the cat, emptying another brand into an empty can of 'her' food. The cat isn't fooled by the deception, however, and runs away, for good...A simple scene, one I thought was simply Altman quirkiness, in '73...but, in fact, it neatly foreshadows the major theme of the film: betrayal by a friend, and the price. As events unfold, Marlowe would uncover treachery, a multitude of lies, and self-serving, amoral characters attempting to 'fool' him...with his resolution decisive, abrupt, and totally unexpected! The casting is first-rate. Elliott Gould, Altman's only choice as Marlowe, actually works extremely well, BECAUSE he is against 'type'. Mumbling, bemused, a cigarette eternally between his lips, he gives the detective a blue-collar integrity that plays beautifully off the snobbish Malibu 'suspects'. And what an array of characters they are! From a grandiosely 'over-the-top' alcoholic writer (Sterling Hayden, in a role intended for Dan Blocker, who passed away, before filming began), to his sophisticated, long-suffering wife (Nina Van Pallandt), to a thuggish Jewish gangster attempting to be genteel (Mark Rydell), to a smug health guru (Henry Gibson), to Marlowe's cocky childhood buddy (Jim Bouton)...everyone has an agenda, and the detective must plow through all the deception, to uncover the truth.There are a couple of notable cameos; Arnold Schwarzenegger, in only his second film, displays his massive physique, as a silent, mustached henchman; and David Carradine plays a philosophical cell mate, after Marlowe 'cracks wise' to the cops.The film was a failure when released; Altman blamed poor marketing, with the studio promoting it as a 'traditional' detective flick, and audiences (including me) expecting a Bogart-like Marlowe. Time has, however, allowed the movie to succeed on it's own merits, and it is, today, considered a classic.So please give the film a second look...You may discover a new favorite, in an old film!",The Long Goodbye
1375,Duck You Sucker,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4371284/,"Well, I finally got around to this movie, and I'm glad I did, but in the end I was left unimpressed. It's a fairly long and meandering ramble concerning displaced IRA revolutionary John Mallory (James Coburn), and an unwilling Mexican one named Juan Miranda (Rod Steiger). The title of the picture is referenced a number of times, usually in connection with Mallory advising his erstwhile partner that something was about to blow up. It may be I lost my focus a few times because the movie didn't hold my interest much, even with Steiger and Coburn in the lead roles. The two Johnny's never really seemed that charismatic in a story that brings them together as partners though much of the time they act individually. I am in fact a fan of Leone's Dollars trilogy, but for me this didn't measure up. Maybe it was the political context, as I prefer the kind of antagonists that are destined to reconcile matters in a final one on one showdown. This one closed with Steiger's character looking somewhat puzzled, and for that I couldn't blame him.",The official title of the movie is Unknown

I still have images and haunting music burned in my brain from it. It has, for one thing, one of the biggest real explosions ever filmed, an absolutely awesome blast using real high explosives that makes today's fiery spectacles pale. I think the whole production company was stunned by it, certainly Sergio Leone was, because he gives it the full treatment: multiple cameras and angles, wide shots, lots of screen time giving us lots of looks. And it's worth it. If you're not a war veteran, you've never seen anything like this.But this film is much more than its fx. It's a deep, moving story told on the grand scale, with Oscar-class cinematography. It is both a major outdoor adventure and a small, intimate story. It has some of the quirkiest scenes, blackest humor and darkest betrayals, too.Don't look for it on TV, unless Turner Classic Movies shows it ""uncut."" It was horribly mutilated in editing for television, and therefore unpopular and rarely shown. Get the original theatrical version, and watch it undisturbed.

Crafted beautifully and with attention to every little detail, from the way the different animal species move to the colorful jungle backgrounds. Wolfgang Reitherman has directed some of the studio's best - but here he has created his masterpiece.

The first 30 minutes seem aimless and wandering, but they set up the main character and what is he is to discover about himself, about his occupation and about art in general. Antonioni builds tension (or frustration as you're watching it) not with plot, but with anti-plot. You want to scream at David Hemmings's character to: focus! screw those models! do something! But as the film unfolds you will see why Antonioni chose this actor, this profession and those girls. A wonderful manifesto about the dangers of voyeurism and what it does to a man's sexuality that is 40 years ahead of its time. The symbolism might get heavy handed at times (mimes, a broken guitar), but the sets are so full of creativity and the actors so beautiful (this will give my age away, but Vanessa Redgrave, who knew?) that you forgive Antonioni (he's Italian after all). Hemmings is Hugh Grant before Hugh Grant, but in this role at least, much more interesting. He's highly sexual, but unlike his painter roommate, his chosen art form represses him, all in the name of the shot. And when he finally gets the perfect shot in the perfect light, it's so perfect that someone steals it, and for good reason. Did those events actually take place or just through his camera lens?

1379,A Hard Day's Night,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0085490/,"I was in my mid-thirties when the Beatles came to America, and appeared at Shea Stadium and (famously) on the Ed Sullivan. I saw their success, with the screaming girls, as just another teen-age phenomenon. I must have read in some column that this film was interesting for its direction and photography. That was true. What I did not expect was that I would be caught up by the Beatles themselves, both as personalities and as musicians. Those who comment adversely on their lack of acting ability are way off base, because neither they nor the director were looking for dramatic skill; only for a degree of naturalness, which was achieved. Those who criticize the technical aspects are not well-acquainted with new developments in film technique especially in France; for instance, the jump shot. Those who criticize lack of plot must be interested only in straight narrative. I suggest that all the previously mentioned critics see the documentary materials on the making of the film, particularly those contained in the DVD set. They will see, for better or worse, that the creators and performers achieved what they wanted, allowing room for the unexpected.

1380,Breakfast at Tiffany's,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0073777/,"An army of fans consider this Hepburn's signature role and in many ways it is, even if she overcame miscasting to portray it. Based on a rather biting novella by Truman Capote, he (somewhat surprisingly) wanted Marilyn Monroe to play the role. The casting of Hepburn couldn't be more different, yet she made it her own and in the process created an icon that is every bit as lasting as Marilyn's skirt-over-the-subway-grate or Bette Davis's off-the-shoulder, chain-smoking Margo Channing. She plays an offbeat, effortlessly sophisticated party girl in New York City who subsists on the favors of various rich men. Though her livelihood couldn't be more tasteless, somehow Hepburn's presence adds a sheen of innocence and sweetness to it. When blocked writer Peppard moves in upstairs (""kept"" by married socialite Neal), the two find themselves developing a friendship which eventually begins to turn into love. But since they are both people who use their bodies to earn their keep and are heavily dependent on others, the chances of their relationship lasting are slim at best. To read the above synopsis, one would expect a gritty, vulgar film. However, in director Blake Edwards' hands and with Hepburn floating around in exquisite Givenchy gowns, the movie is a candy box of color, style, humor and romance.Even when she's hungover or just getting home from an all-nighter (as in the famous opening scene), Hepburn strikes a graceful and glamorous figure. In fact, it's when she's trying to act disoriented or disheveled that her performance is at it's weakest. It's as if she was so inherently stylish that she had to try (too) hard to present anything else! She does a very fine job with the role, even if the character's past is nothing short of preposterous. Peppard comes off as blandly attractive, but wooden. His arrogance regarding his role (fiercely protecting the traditional leading man image) not only undercut his own performance, but also slighted that of Neal's who was diminished as a result. However, sentimental filmgoers probably prefer his more heroic approach and Neal would certainly recoup her losses, earning an Oscar a short time later for ""Hud"". The most controversial aspect of the film is Rooney's portrayal of an Asian man who lives above Hepburn and who is awakened at all hours by her lifestyle. Whether or not one is offended by the over-the-top stereotype of the buck teeth and slant eyes, the role is not funny anyway! It's all way too forced and obvious, with his pratfalls in sight long before they occur. (A lamp exists RIGHT over his bed for the express purpose of giving him something to hit his head on continuously. Move it, already!) There are many memorable moments in the film including a sequence of Hepburn and Peppard doing things they've never done before, Hepburn sitting on the fire escape plaintively singing the Oscar-winning song ""Moon River"" (which is used throughout the film by master composer Henry Mancini) and wacky party scene (a prelude to Edwards' ""The Party""?) in which all sorts of outre things take place including the cry ""Timber!"" when a tipsy guest begins to collapse. There's a surprising frankness, for the time, regarding Peppard and Neal's relationship. It seems to be one of the earliest Hollywood films in which the leading man is implied to be nude under the covers in his bed. The film is not without its flaws. Some of the dialogue is annoyingly indulgent and the storyline is fairly patchy (with a tacked on ending.) Still, with the sparkling presence of Hepburn (in some mind-blowing hats and costumes) and the slick work of Edwards, it is easy entertainment.",Breakfast at Tiffany's
1381,From Here to Eternity,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1788731/,"There has always been a debate regarding what film could regarded as the best of all time and it will always go on. But to me, this film does it all. It brings to the screen all of the essence of what life is about: happiness, sadness, betrayal ,pain, and most of all what real love is all about. There are so many things that make this film my favorite all time and my choice for number one but it's 3 scenes that clinch it: First, the one with Burt Lancaster and Deborah Kerr in the car when he says: ""I have never been as miserable as I am since I met you"" and her reply ""neither have I"" and then he follows with ""I wouldn't trade a minute of it"" and again she says "" Neither would I"". That is what real, deep love between 2 people makes them feel. How many films brought love to screen like that? no other movie I have ever seen. The second is when Montgomery Clift tells Donna Reed: ""No one ever lies about being lonely"". That is so, so real. And third, the scene when Frank Sinatra says his last words and then dies. I know very little about how Oscar's are voted on, but I feel Sinatra won his right in that scene. How many other films can you say that? This film never gets dull. It's 2 + hours of pure human emotion that has never before or never since been put on the screen.",N/A
